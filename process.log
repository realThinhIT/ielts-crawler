& content = Public libraries used to be the treasure house of knowledge and information but according to some people in this age of the internet they are of no importance. Of course, many people disagree with this view. In my opinion, state funded libraries certainly have become less important than they used to be; however, I cannot support the argument that they are no longer important.
The internet has made state run libraries less important. These days, if you have a device like a smart phone or a computer and an internet connection, you can find up to date information on any topic in a fraction of seconds. Actually, finding information online is a whole lot easier than going to a library and reading voluminous books. Thanks to the search function of the internet, we do not have to turn over pages after pages to find what we want. We just need to type in our query and we get the answer instantly. Needless to say, people who have constant access to the internet no longer visit libraries.
On the other hand, public libraries still serve some valuable purpose. To start with, the information on the internet is relatively new whereas libraries have an impressive collection of old manuscripts that are not available online. Also, much of the information online is in English whereas libraries have a huge collection of books written in a wide variety of languages. What’s more, libraries only keep the best reference books on a topic; by contrast, information found online can be unreliable or false because there is no one to check the veracity of data posted online. For this reason, libraries are still the best source of information for research scholars. Libraries also provide a quiet environment where students can read without facing any distractions.
In conclusion, there is no denying the fact that public libraries have lost some of their importance. Even so, they are still needed because information stored in a library is always reliable and accurate. Also, libraries have old books and manuscripts that are not available online.
Here is a band 7.5 essay on this topic submitted by one of our students.
It is often argued that the government-run libraries are not of much use these days. However, there are others who still feel that public libraries are serving a meaningful purpose in the and also shares my own perspective.
There are two major reasons for the decreasing popularity of public libraries. Firstly, most public libraries are situated at the city center, and people find travelling to these libraries for borrowing a book quite cumbersome due to their busy schedule and frequent traffic congestion on the roads. Secondly, with the advent of the Internet and the proliferation of the smartphones ample information is available online, so there is no point in spending time in the library. For example, if a student wants to learn about the solar system, he might find a few books related to this topic in the library. On the other hand, if he looks looks it up on the web, he is likely to find abundant resources.
Despite the above mentioned reasons, there are several persuasive arguments in favour of the importance of public libraries. To begin with, not everyone can afford an expensive smart phone and the Internet, particularly students from economically disadvantaged families. For instance, my house cleaner’s son often visits the nearby public library in order to get free books, which his father cannot afford to buy with the meagre salary he earns. Furthermore, these libraries represent the history of the city. When a tourist goes to a new place, he can visit a public library to pick up a map of the city or to learn about the history of the place.
In conclusion, I believe both arguments are relevant. On balance, in my opinion government-run libraries are becoming obsolete because of the advancement in information technology and the lack of time as the general public finds it time-consuming to go to a library. Even so, libraries are helpful for people who cannot access the internet.

Sample essay
Nowadays a lot of people are debating whether online classes can be an alternative to regular classes. In my opinion, they can. I personally believe that the advancement in technology has made it possible to make some revolutionary changes to the education system. Online learning is one of them.
The biggest advantage of online classes is that they are convenient. They allow students to learn at their pace and at a time convenient for them. Regular classes, on the other hand, have fixed hours. If you have a full time job or a young child or aged parents to take care of, you cannot attend them. Online classes are actually a boon for people who have other commitments that prevent them from attending classes delivered on the campus.
In this day and age, learning has become a never-ending process. People are constantly upgrading their skills to improve their career prospects. They are enrolling in new courses in the middle of their career. If universities didn’t offer the option of online learning, most of them would be in a fix because few people can afford to quit their job to learn a new skill. Online courses also allow students to obtain foreign degrees without having to leave their country. For example, students in India can join online courses offered by foreign universities and obtain coveted degrees sitting at home.
Perhaps the biggest argument against online courses is the lack of quality control. But this has changed over the years because of advancements in technology. Now that several internationally acclaimed universities have also started offering online classes, their credibility has also increased.
To conclude, in my opinion, online classes are a positive development and a nice alternative to regular classes conducted on campus.

Sample essay
Punishing people who commit crimes is crucial to maintaining law and order in a society. Some people believe that there should be a fixed punishment for each crime. Others disagree. In their opinion, factors such as the motive behind the crime too should be considered while deciding on the punishment. Although I agree that people who commit crimes should be given exemplary punishment, in my opinion, the judge should also consider the circumstances that led to the crime.
If there is a fixed punishment for each crime, all people who commit murder will get the same punishment. This system will certainly improve judgement efficiency. Since the punishment for each crime has already been given in law books, judges only have to pronounce the verdict. Also when the punishments are consistent with regulations established previously, there will be fewer law conflicts.
Unfortunately, the above arguments in favour of a fixed punishment are not as logical as they sound. Human behaviour is almost always influenced by circumstances. Crime is no different. It is possible for two people who commit murders to have entirely different motives. Perhaps one of them committed the act with the deliberate intention to kill while the other was merely trying to save himself from the attacker while committing the murder accidentally. If there are fixed punishments for murder, both of them will receive the same punishment. This is unfair. It is also unfair to give juveniles the same punishment as adults. It is thus evident that serious ethical issues may arise if fixed punishments are given for each crime.
In my opinion, while awarding the punishment the judge should consider not only the severity of the crime but also the circumstances that led to it. To conclude, it does not make sense to have fixed punishment for each crime because no two persons who commit the same crime have the same motive.

Sample essay
Travel and work are obviously the most popular reasons to learn a foreign language. People all over the world learn foreign languages like English, German and Spanish with the objective of living or working in countries where these languages are spoken. This, however, does not mean that someone who has no intention to visit or work in a foreign country does not have to learn a foreign language. Actually, learning a second or third language benefits everyone.
Language improves our cognitive skills. Studies have shown that bilingual people are smarter than people who speak only one language. Multilingual people are even smarter. Learning a foreign language helps our brain in many ways. It allows us to make connections faster and remember things better. It is not surprising that bilingual people earn higher salaries and make better relationships.
Thanks to the advent of the internet, the world has become a village. We can now meet people from all parts of the world online. If we speak a foreign language, we will also be able to talk to them, share ideas and get answers for our questions. This clearly explains why an inability to speak a foreign language is a disability in this modern world. When we learn a foreign language, we also develop respect for the culture of the people who speak that language. This understanding and admiration for other cultures forge better relationships between people and nations.
To conclude, there are numerous benefits to learning a foreign language. Travel and work are just two of them. Language skills also make us smarter and better.

Band 9 sample essay
Every generation has its set of values. The values that young people cherish are not necessarily those of their parents or grandparents. In fact, youngsters often rebel against the traditional values of older people. In their opinion, the traditional way of thinking, living or behaving is not appropriate for the modern age. I both agree and disagree with this.
The argument that the traditional way of living is not very helpful in the modern world is true to some extent. For example, many orthodox families in Asia still have apprehensions about sending their daughters to college or work. They believe that a woman’s world is within the four walls of her home. Of course, young women rebel against this mindset and I fully support them. The traditional code of conduct has its limitations too. For example, the older generation does not want young men and women to have excessively friendly relationships between them. While I am against immoral liaisons, I do believe that in this day and age women have to interact with men on various levels and parents or grandparents who prevent their daughters from meeting or talking to men are not helping them in any way.
On the flip side, there are still a lot of things that we can learn from older generations. The older people are used to living in joint families. They believe in sharing the joys and sorrows of life. By contrast, younger people raised in nuclear families tend to be more selfish. They can indeed learn values of kindness, compassion and sharing from their elders.
To conclude, in my opinion, there are still a lot of things that we can learn from the traditional values of older generations. This, however, does not mean that every belief of our parents or grandparents is suitable for the modern life. In my opinion, values also need to change with times.

Give specific details and examples for your answer.
Sample essay
There are mainly two ways for producing things – using hands and using machines. Machine manufacturing is faster and more economical. Even so I prefer hand-made products because when things are made by hand, each one is unique in its own way. Machine-made goods lack this uniqueness.
The biggest advantage of machine manufacturing is that it is faster. Also machine-made goods are cheaper than hand-made goods. Using machines we can produce tens of thousands of identical copies of an object in a short amount of time. This makes machine manufacturing ideal for mass production. To produce an equal number of products using hands, a company will have to hire thousands of people.
On the other hand, the initial cost of setting up a factory is pretty high in the case of machine manufacturing and it may take several months or even years to recover the investment. By contrast when goods are made by hands, the labour costs may be higher but other expenses are negligible. As a result, even if one does not have a lot of money to invest, one can easily launch a business of manufacturing hand-made goods.
There is yet another advantage to producing goods by hand. They look unique, elegant and desirable. For example, Switzerland is famous for the production of hand-made watches which are well known in all parts of the globe for their accuracy and charm. Likewise, hand-made silk saris produced in Banaras are cherished by millions of Indian women for their meticulous details. If hand-woven fabrics are compared with machine-made fabrics, the former will look and feel superior to the latter. This is because of the creativity with which hand-made goods are made.
To conclude, in my perspectives as a buyer, hand-made items are superior to machine-made goods in several ways. Of course, machine manufacturing certainly has some advantages but machine-made goods cannot beat hand-made goods in quality or elegance.

Do you agree or disagree?
Sample essay
People have been debating the positive and negative aspects of advertising for a while. Some people believe that advertisements must be banned because they have negative impacts on our lives. Others including I disagree with them. My actual observation of life has convinced me of the positive aspects of advertising. In this essay, I shall explain my point of view by analyzing both sides of the argument.
First of all, advertisements educate people and expand their knowledge. From commercials we hear about new products which can solve many of the problems we face in our everyday life. My opinion was echoed by Naomi Miller, Chairwoman of the education department at Hunter University. In an article that she published, Professor Miller describes a study of 181 families. Some of them watched advertisements, while others did not. The study showed that there was a 95% increase in productivity in the first group because they were aware of the new products in the market and used appliances like dishwashers to improve their productivity and efficiency.
Admittedly, despite all the reasonable evidence in favour of advertisements, some people argue that they influence people negatively and therefore should be restricted. Firstly, they claim that some advertisements market fake products. They are also concerned about the consequences of using fake products. Of course, these concerns sound convincing and stand to reason. However, if consumers exercise caution, they can avoid falling prey to false claims made by advertisers. After all, nobody is supposed to believe all that they see or hear in commercials.
In conclusion, while there are strong arguments on both sides of the case, my personal opinion is that without advertisements we would not be aware of the new products and innovations in the market. That’s why I would strongly recommend advertising and disagree with their restriction.

Sample essay
Consumer goods are flying off the shelves. People feel a compulsive need to buy them because their friends and colleagues have already bought them. They don’t care whether they need a particular product or not. The thrill is in buying. Therefore, I agree with the argument that the huge popularity of consumer goods is a reflection of the power of advertising.
Commercials always present a product as a must-have. However, the reality is different. It is perfectly possible to lead a normal life without owing the latest version of the iPhone. Still people are standing in queues for hours on end to get their model as soon as a new version of the famed phone launches. Everyone wants to be the first among their friends to own the latest iPad or iPhone. It is touted as an achievement.
New age commercials exploit the human need to brag and show off. They showcase their product as cool and sexy and drive home the point that if you own it, you will also be cool. Ten or fifteen years ago smart phones didn’t exist. People were still able to communicate with one another without much difficulty. Nowadays it is hard to find someone who doesn’t have a smart phone. This does not mean that people’s need to communicate has increased. It shows the power of advertising. Smart phones have become a status symbol. You need to possess the latest model. Otherwise, you feel inferior to your peers who dump their perfectly working old phones as soon as a new model hits the market. Phones are no longer a device we use to make calls. They now possess a lot of features that the vast majority of us do not use or even need. Still, we feel a compulsive need to own the latest version. This is true in the case of other products too. Everyone wants the latest model cars or gaming consoles.
To conclude, it is evident that advertising drives sales. Commercials have such a huge impact on our lives that we don’t mind spending our hard-earned money on products that we don’t even need.

& content = Nowadays young people prefer to move to big cities; older people, on the other hand, prefer to stay in the countryside. Why is this so? Discuss the reasons.
Sample response
Cities provide jobs and opportunities. That is the main reason youngsters prefer to move to cities.
Youngsters are full of energy. They are eager to accomplish things and they want to live their life to the fullest. Cities satisfy their cravings for career growth, personal development and recreation. Major cities have entertainment hubs, a great night life, shopping centers and modern transport systems. All of these attract youngsters to them.
People all over the world migrate from villages to urban areas in search of jobs and other opportunities. For youngsters, earning enough to achieve their financial goals and saving money for their retirement is the biggest concern. Cities make this possible.
There is a limit to what a youngster can do in the countryside. In most villages, there are no offices or factories that offer employment. In fact, most villagers keep themselves occupied with farming and other related activities. These occupations do not interest educated and ambitious young people.
Most seniors feel an irresistible need to stay connected to their roots. They are not exactly looking for career growth. Also, most of them have little interest in shopping or partying. What they seek is peace and serenity. They have already spent thirty and forty years working and want to spend their twilight years in the serene surroundings of the countryside. For example, in India, many people move to cities in their early twenties. After working there for about forty years, they return to their villages where they spend the rest of their lives. Also, villages are less polluted than cities. The clean air in the countryside is more beneficial to seniors who have less immunity.
To conclude, our life choices and preferences are based on our needs. When we are young we need employment and financial security so we move to cities that satisfy these needs. When we are old, we seek peace and proximity to old friends and family, so we move to the countryside.

Sample essay
Global economy may have developed considerably over the last few decades; however, millions of people still do not have homes. This problem is particularly worse in developing and undeveloped countries. Some people argue that the government should take care of this situation by providing free housing to the poor. That demand certainly sounds logical; however, I don’t think that it is the best solution.
To start with, the government can’t provide free housing to all poor people. Any such attempt will put too much pressure on the public exchequer. The government already has a lot of other things to take care of. For example, in India, the government provides free education and free medical care through government schools and hospitals. Many government colleges and universities even provide higher education free of cost. There are also several government schemes for the rehabilitation of slum dwellers in urban areas. In the tribal areas, too, the government provides free housing to the homeless.
Having said that, providing free homes to all poor people in the country does not seem possible. A better solution is to make homes more affordable. If homes are unaffordable, that is because of the exorbitant land prices. The government can make homes less expensive by allotting government land at concessional rates and waiving taxes on the homes built on this land. Low cost housing projects can be launched all over the country. Only basic amenities should be provided in these homes to make them more affordable.
To conclude, although I do not think that government should provide free housing to all homeless people in the country, I am in favour of the government launching low cost housing projects. The government should also consider giving free land to the landless. These initiatives will certainly make homes more affordable and solve the problems of the poor to a great extent.

Sample essay
Some individuals believe that increasing the minimum legal age for driving cars or motor bikes is the best way to increase road safety. While I admit that this policy can be beneficial to some extent, in my opinion, there are better ways to reduce traffic accidents.
It might be a good idea to increase the minimum age requirement for driving for some reasons. Firstly, younger people are less mature and less responsible. They might not be aware of the importance of following traffic rules. Therefore, it makes sense to ban them from driving to prevent them from breaking the law and causing accidents. Secondly, as older people are more experienced, they know how to react quickly to dangerous situations on the road. To illustrate, if the brakes of a car suddenly stop working, a young driver might panic and accidents could occur. An experienced driver will be able to handle the situation with more maturity.
However, I would argue that there are much better ways to ensure road safety. The first one is to improve the quality of our roads. Accidents are less likely to occur on wider, bump-free roads. It is also important to have stricter punishments for careless drivers. For example, people who break traffic rules should be required to pay huge fines or be banned permanently from getting behind the wheel. Strict laws will encourage drivers to respect the law and traffic accidents will reduce. Another solution is to encourage people to use public transport rather than private vehicles. This can be done by reducing the fares and increasing the frequency of buses and tubes to make it convenient for the users.
In conclusion, I believe that increasing the legal age for driving is not the best solution for improving road safety. It might help, but we need to take other measures too. For example, building better roads and improving the efficiency of public transport will deliver better results.

& content = Tobacco mainly in the form of cigarettes is one of the most widely used drugs in the world. Over a billion adults legally smoke tobacco every day. The long term health costs are high – for smokers themselves, and for the wider community in terms of health care costs and lost productivity. Do governments have a legitimate role to protect citizens from the harmful effects of their own decisions to smoke, or are such decisions up to the individual.
Sample essay
When an individual consumes 3 Cigarettes sticks per day and is diagnosed with Cancer who is to be blamed – the Government or the Individual? In my view both the individual as well as the Government are responsible for the Tobacco menace and only a joint effort can help curb the menace.
Government can play a pivotal role to raise awareness about the harmful effects of Tobacco on individual’s health. This can be done by displaying the ill-effects of Cigarettes on the packaging. In-addition, they can restrict supply of Tobacco thereby reducing the total available cigarettes for consumption. For example they can restrict the total area under cultivation for Leaf tobacco thereby reducing the total tobacco manufactured. Lastly they can levy heavy fines for consuming tobacco in public thereby not allowing people to spread the Cigarettes menace.
Although Government can take certain steps to reduce the menace it alone does not have the power to solve the problem. It is ultimately the individual who smokes a Cigarette who has to stop Cigarette consumption. The smoker has to understand the ill-effects of Cigarette addiction and ultimately decide to stop consuming cigarettes. If smoker does not understand the harmful effects then the menace would go on. It is ultimately the smoker who creates demand for such products and if he reduces the consumption then there would not be any demand for Cigarettes and obviously there would be no sale of such products in the market.
To conclude it is both, the Government and the individual who can ultimately work together to reduce and restrict the Tobacco consumption and stop the menace from spreading.
Analysis
Overall, this seems to be a band 7.5 essay.

What other measures do you think might be effective?
Band 8 essay sample
Over the last two decades there has been a massive increase in the number of vehicles on the road. This can be attributed to the increased buying power of people; however, it has also led to traffic problems and pollution in big cities.
Some people argue that this problem can be solved to a great extent by increasing fuel prices. I do not agree with this opinion because it can cause a ripple effect.
The decision to increase the price of petrol could make people think twice before using their personal vehicle.  However, the other effects of this price hike should also be analyzed before taking such a decision. Petrol being the basic requirement for transportation, any hike in the price of petrol will increase the overall inflation in the country. Moreover it will cause hardship to daily commuters and school students. This will also result in a skewed supply chain relationship of petrol as a commodity.
There are other alternatives that the government could explore to curb pollution and traffic. The government could, for example, decentralize urban areas and develop small cities. Developing the infrastructure by constructing flyovers and alternate routes is another viable alternative. Big cities could also try a metro rail network connecting key hubs. In addition to the above, government could modify school timings to further ease traffic congestion.
To summarize, infrastructure developments could be planned and implemented with the future vehicle growth in mind. Infrastructure development will also go a long way in improving the overall economy of the country.

The acceptable mode of transportation in cities is still a debatable topic. While a bunch of people believe that motor vehicles are the best means of transportation to be used in cities, others state that bicycles are better alternatives. Although automobiles are a comfortable and fast mode of transportation, in my opinion, bicycles are better for health and environment.
No doubt private cars are attractive means of transportation in major cities. They make traveling convenient. Driving a car is not a physically strenuous activity. Also, someone driving a car is not exposed to harsh weather. For example, take the case of Moscow where the temperature reaches freezing point in winter. In such extreme weather conditions it is impossible to use anything other than cars or public transport. Moreover, cars can save us a lot of time, especially when a person knows how to avoid congested traffic by using highways. However, in addition to the cost of fuels, maintenance and registry, finding parking spaces is another principle obstacle in utilizing private cars.
Bicycles as a mode of transportation in urban regions, on the other hand, are fascinating alternatives. They help to improve the physical fitness of riders and also control obesity-related health illnesses. A study showed that a daily 30 minutes bicycle ride can mitigate the risk of hypertension, diabetes and bad lipid disorders. Additionally, bicycles are eco-friendly means of transportation. That is to say that there is no risk of air pollution which is the key concern with the use of cars. Thus it is evident that using bicycles for transportation improves air quality in main cities. I opine that this method of transportation is good for urban areas and authorities should encourage more and more people to adopt it.
To conclude, bicycles and cars have their merits and demerits as modes of transportation. Even so, since pollution is a major problem in cities an eco-friendly option like bicycles is better than cars especially in favourable weather conditions. However, during extreme weather conditions, it is better to use cars.

The following is an essay submitted by one of our readers.
Band 6.5 essay sample
The fact that the youths chose to spend their spare time in shopping centres is believed to exhibit undesirable effects on them and society. This essay strongly disagrees that investing free time in shopping malls has a negative impact on young people and community. Firstly, the idea of shopping malls as socialising venues will be explained, and, secondly, this essay will look at how this event can affect society.
Shopping malls are considered by young people as convenient and attractive venues to socialise and enjoy their free time. They not only offer a variety of leisure options, but they also allow young people to develop new friendships or strengthen their current ones. For example, gathering with friends in my town´s shopping mall to simply enjoy a delicious milkshake and a good conversation, is my favourite time of the week, because I can distract my mind and reconnect with friends.
Spending time in a shopping mall entails buying in most cases, regardless of group age. Young people tend to spend money easily, and, therefore, they are viewed as consumers who help businesses to progress, and, moreover, exerting a positive effect on society. For instance, I always spend money when meeting up with my friends in the shopping mall, by buying clothes or a meal.
In conclusion, shopping malls are appropriate and attractive places for young people to socialise in their free time, while providing concomitant benefits to businesses, which contributes to society. Therefore, I totally disagree with the initial statement and I believe young people ought to be more encouraged to visit shopping malls.

Student’s essay
Students are currently able to acquire information on the internet in a much faster way than in the past. While I accept that online resources of information have advantages over traditional libraries, I would argue that there is still a great need for libraries in today’s world.
It is true that accessing information online has several clear benefits. The first one is that online sources can store a lot more information than any physical library. This allows researchers to easily get information without travelling to a local library. Furthermore, students can look for information on the internet whenever they want, while most libraries can only be visited during certain hours of the day. As a result, finding information online is easier for people who are busy with their work during daytime.
However, I believe that physical libraries still have special features that online sources can never have. The first one, of course, is the ambience. Libraries usually provide a quiet space for reading or learning. This will greatly benefit students who are learning or researching since they are less likely to be distracted by people or things around them. For example, many university students claim that they can only concentrate when they are in a quiet study area in their university library. Secondly, since everyone can easily write and post information on the internet, these online sources are not always reliable for research. Therefore, we need libraries whose staff members have the responsibility to select and provide readers with the most credible materials.
In conclusion, while I agree that there are several benefits to getting information on the internet, I disagree with the idea that traditional libraries are no longer important.

& content = Nowadays most people wear western clothing rather than their traditional clothes. What are the reasons for it? Is it a positive or a negative development?
There is no denying the fact that western clothes are becoming popular all over the world. They are stylish, practical and suit a variety of body types. In my opinion, the worldwide adoption of western clothes is a positive thing.
Much of the popularity of western clothes can be attributed to the fact that western countries are the center of education and business. They attract students and professionals from all over the world. Hollywood films also played an important role in making western clothes popular all over the world.
The biggest advantage of wearing western clothes is that they protect the wearer from dress-based discrimination. This is important in the modern world where people are migrating to foreign nations to study or work. An Asian student wearing western outfits on a campus in the US or Europe is less likely to feel cultural alienation. The fact that he is also wearing the same outfits as other students on the campus makes it easy for him to fit into the new surroundings.
Another advantage of wearing western clothes is that they are available practically everywhere. You can buy them from just about any shop and that eliminates the need to carry bundles of clothing with you when you travel abroad. This is not exactly the case with traditional outfits. In many cases, you can only buy them from your country. For example, Indian outfits like dhoti, sari or salwar kameez are not readily available in many parts of the world. So, if an Indian living abroad insists on wearing only Indian clothes, he will face a lot of difficulty. By adopting western clothes they can get around this difficulty.
To conclude, the adoption of western outfits is a positive thing. Western countries are regarded as the land of opportunities. This is exactly the reason that made western clothing popular all over the world.

Sample response
Buildings make great landmarks and grab attention. In my opinion, they have to be functional and attractive. Both aspects are equally important and a building that satisfies only one of these criteria cannot be considered as a successful project.
Beautiful buildings add character to a city. Aesthetically designed buildings even have a commercial value. Take, for instance, the case of forts, palaces and castles. They attract visitors even today. People talk about their architectural brilliance; they talk highly of the architects who conceived these buildings. None will want to visit these buildings today if they don’t look good.
Well-designed buildings have enduring appeal. The most famous buildings in the world are as beautiful as they are functional. People still flock to see monuments such as Taj Mahal, Mysore Palace, Eiffel Tower and Buckingham Palace. They are not exactly concerned with the functional aspects of these buildings. What attracts them to these structures is their beauty. Taj Mahal, for example, is nothing more than a mausoleum, but that building attracts more people than any other building in India simply because it is one of the most beautiful buildings in their world.
Buildings are much more than a place to work, rest or sleep. They serve several other purposes as well. It is possible to build beautiful buildings that also serve their purposes well. Of course, this might increase the cost of construction, but in the long term the benefits will outweigh the initial cost.
To conclude, buildings last decades or even centuries. Since they are permanent structures that will adorn our skyline for a long time, it makes sense to pay attention to their aesthetic aspects as well. Lots of natural resources are required to construct a building. The frenetic pace with which buildings are being constructed has already caused the depletion of natural resources. Therefore, people should be discouraged from building excessively large buildings or spending a lot of money on beatifying buildings.

Cultural alienation is one of the major problems that youngsters face. They know hardly anything about their culture and values. Consequently they have little respect for their customs or traditions. For many of these people, culture is what they see in Hollywood movies. This is a dangerous situation. Youngsters need to be rooted in their culture to be able to contribute anything meaningful to their society.
Culture and patriotism always go hand in hand. People who love their culture also tend to love their country. They will want to work for the betterment of their community. Such people are the greatest asset any nation can have.
Less interaction between children and parents/grandparents is one of the main reasons that distance children from their culture. In many families now both parents work. Children are often sent to day care centers where they spend much of their time watching cartoon channels or foreign television programs. Earlier children used to spend a lot of time with their grandparents who would tell them stories from mythology. Such stories not only entertained the kids, but also taught them important things about their culture. Media has also played an important role in this. In a bid to project itself as ‘cool’ and modern, media often eulogizes foreign cultures and create the impression that one’s own culture isn’t good enough.
Parents and teachers need to make a concerted effort to fight this menace. Parents need to make a conscious effort to familiarize their children about their culture and civilization. Most of them are only concerned about academic grades. This has to change. The government can also play an important role. Culture should be taught in schools. Just because a society is secular, it doesn’t mean that it should eliminate all references to culture and religion from textbooks.
To conclude, exposure to foreign cultures through television from a very young age and little interaction with one’s parents and grandparents are the main reasons that make young people ignorant of their own cultures. However, solving this problem is not all that difficult. It just requires the concerted efforts of parents, teachers and the government.
