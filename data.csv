1,Some people think that human history has been a journey from ignorance to knowledge. Others argue that this underestimates the achievements of ancient cultures and overvalues our achievements. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"Within the span of a few thousand years, humans have gone from using tools made of rocks to living in the skyscrapers. It is often debated whether our accomplishments are more valuable than those of our ancestors. In my opinion, they certainly are. The truth is in the last fifty years alone, humans achieved a lot more than what our ancestors achieved in 5000 years.
The ancient man lived in the caves and had little understanding of the world outside. They used rocks to hunt animals. It took them centuries to learn the practice of farming. However, once they had enough to eat and a safe place to live in humans started making tremendous progress. Even today many things that they achieved remain a mystery to us. For example, we still do not know how the great pyramids of Egypt were built with the minimal tools available during that era. Furthermore, prehistoric humans managed to travel the globe without access to modern navigation systems such as GPS and state-of-the-art ships. To illustrate, early humans relied solely on the stars to guide them in their travel and they shaped tree trunks to produce vessels to carry them across the oceans. Of course, their achievements cannot be undervalued.
Yet, we have ample reasons to believe that the modern man has achieved a lot more. Today, the modern technology enables us to live a life better than what our forefathers lived. With the invention of the internet, we can now communicate with anyone regardless of their geographical location. For example, Skype enables families to have a live video conference call that feels like everyone is in the same room. This was not possible ten or fifteen years ago. Moreover, in the past, humans rarely managed to live past 30 or 40 years but today the average life expectancy in the developing and developed world is 70 years or above. People are now able to live much longer and healthier due to modern medicines and the knowledge of a better lifestyle. Obviously, modern technology enables us to enjoy many things that were not possible in the past.
In conclusion, even though some achievements of our forefathers remain a mystery even today due to our lack of understanding of the early humans and their know-how, I strongly believe that today’s technology and our achievements are more valuable than what our ancestors achieved.",9,some-people-think-that-human-history-has-been-a-journey-from-ignorance-to-knowledge-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
2,Many childhood diseases can now be prevented through the use of vaccines. Should parents be made by law to immunize their children against common diseases or should individuals have the right to choose not to immunize their children?,"The general argument is that parents know what is best for their children but this is not always the case. For example, there are still many parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. While some people argue that parents should have the option to opt out of child vaccination programmes, I believe that the government should make it illegal for parents not to immunize their children.
Of course, not every child is a candidate for vaccines and some exceptions should be made. Some kids are born physically weaker than other kids. For this reason, their parents should consult medical experts prior to getting their children immunized to prevent unwanted side effects. For example, children who are diagnosed with some genetic disorders should not be given vaccines that can cause more harm than good. Next, isolated tribes that are cut from the outside world should also be exempt from vaccinations. For instance, the Amazonians are living in the deep jungle of Brazil and they have no contacts with outsiders; hence, they are not exposed to many diseases that typically affect children. As a result, modern vaccines are deemed unnecessary for these people who live in isolation.
On the other hand, since the vast majority of children benefit from vaccination, it is the duty of the government to ensure that they have access to it. One way of achieving this is to make it compulsory for parents to immunize their children. This will not only ensure that children are given the best possible protection against incurable illnesses, but also help to prevent the spread of some diseases. For example, polio has been successfully eradicated due to government intervention that made polio vaccination compulsory in the 1950’s. In many parts of the world, there are still parents who choose not to provide vaccinations to their children because of superstitions and various socio-religious reasons. Making vaccinations mandatory is the only way to ensure that all kids have access to lifesaving shots. The government should also make vaccination certificates mandatory for admission to schools.
In conclusion, vaccinations help save lives and the only way to ensure that all kids have access to them is to make it a legal requirement. Of course, children should be exempted from receiving vaccinations in cases where the downsides of receiving the shots outweigh the benefits.",9,many-childhood-diseases-can-now-be-prevented-through-the-use-of-vaccines-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
3,"Many people think that the government should spend money to explore outer space, while others think that it is a waste of public money. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","According to some people, the government should not spend money on space exploration. I agree with this view. In my opinion, there are other areas that need public spending. Also, space exploration is not crucial for the development of a country.
Of course, there are some benefits to investing in space research. It helps us to learn more about the universe we are a part of. Also, there is a possibility that some space missions may find life on other planets. We may also be able to find other inhabitable planets. Since, population growth is leading to a resource crunch on planet earth, finding another planet that can sustain life is in the larger interest of the whole humanity.
On the other hand, there is no guarantee that we will find another planet that we can colonize. It is a mere possibility and it may take hundreds or thousands of years before we actually manage to achieve it. Hence, spending public money on such projects is unlikely to offer much in return at the moment. What’s more, there are several other pressing needs on earth that need immediate resolution. For example, millions of people still do not have access to potable water or education. Even today, thousands of people die in war and conflicts almost every day. It is foolish to spend money on space programmes before addressing these issues. Actually, making our planet more livable is much better than finding another planet to live in.
In conclusion, although outer space exploration projects help us to learn more about the universe, these projects are not crucial for the development of a country. Moreover, public money should be spent on more pressing issues like healthcare and education because they directly impact the public.",9,spending-money-on-space-exploration-programmes-is-a-waste-of-money-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
4,"Though modern life is much facilitated by automobiles, it would have been better if they were not invented. Do you agree with this statement?","Automobiles have played an important role in the progress of the human society. Some people believe that it would have been better if they were not invented. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, cars have done more good than harm and it is impossible to even imagine a life without them. Even so, it is important for us to limit the use of private cars.
The world has become a village due to the invention and subsequent evolution of the automobile industry. Today we can travel to distant places in a short span of time. Actually, journeys that used to take weeks or months in the past can now be completed within hours or days. Cars have also made our journey more comfortable. Rain or shine if we have a car we can go anywhere whenever we want. This can be quite liberating. The invention of the car has also enabled people living in remote areas to pursue work or studies in cities. The primary advantage of cars is that they can reach places that are not accessible by buses or trains. And in emergency situations, they can become lifesavers.
Of course, automobiles pollute and that is the main downside of them. This, however, does not mean that they need not have been invented. Actually, we can control pollution by limiting the use of cars and also by taking measures such as carpooling. In addition, we should use public transport whenever possible. We should also adopt technologies like electric cars. Since they do not emit harmful gases, they have little impact on the planet.
In conclusion, automobiles have become an indispensable part of our life today because of the comfort and convenience they offer. They do have some negative impact on the environment. However, this does not mean that they should not have been invented.",9,it-would-have-been-better-if-automobiles-were-not-invented-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
5,Lifestyle and culture of different countries are becoming similar. Is it a positive development or negative?,"Advancements in communication technology have made the entire world a global village where information travels from one corner to another in the blink of an eye. Due to this information symmetry and accessibility, the world is becoming increasingly similar. Some people argue that this is a negative development. While I do not quite consider this as totally negative, in my opinion, there is definitely a need to preserve diversity.
The first and foremost reason to oppose the tendency of countries to become similar is that it will lead to the loss of indigenous culture, traditions, customs and lifestyles. These lifestyles and culture were developed several millennia ago and suit the specific country. So, adopting another country’s lifestyles and culture might not be suitable for people living in that country. For example, in a country like India, it is better to eat vegetarian food and wear cotton clothes because the climate is hot. Furthermore, it is unsustainable if people living everywhere follow the same lifestyle. For example, the per capita consumption of fossil fuels in the USA is 20 times higher than the per capita consumption of the same fuel in a developing country. If people everywhere start using the same amount of energy, we will soon run out of its supply.
Another reason for nurturing diversity is that diversity enhances innovation. Different culture and lifestyles provide one a different perspective on life. Thus, many schools and colleges prefer to increase diversity in their classroom to enrich the learning experience.  In the past, many pharmaceutical research teams in the USA attributed their success to essential inputs brought in by teammates of different nationality.
On the other hand, by adopting similarity, one can protect oneself from discrimination based on race, nationality or style of clothing. In addition, similarity enhances acceptance. It also makes life easier especially when people travel abroad.
In conclusion, considering the aforementioned views, in my opinion, it is crucial to protect diversity of different countries but at the same time there is no harm in imbibing the best practices of other countries.",9,lifestyle-and-culture-of-different-countries-are-becoming-similar-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
6,"Media has a big role to play in the spreading of any news and curiosity building. Which type of news do you feel media should give more focus to, good or bad?","Thanks to advancements in communication technology, media now plays a crucial role in our lives. It has the ability to influence a large set of people within a short span of time. Television and the internet, for example, can provide live coverage of events happening all over the world. This unique ability of media makes it all too powerful because it can be used for both good and bad purposes.
Using media for good purpose is crucial. Due to its increased reach, media now wields greater power than in the past. It influences not only mature adults but also innocent children and hence it is crucial to share appropriate content. Studies have shown that media has a major impact on a child’s psychology. If children get exposed to violent or inappropriate content on television or the internet, it can affect their normal development.
Not only children but adults are also influenced by media content. For example, when media gives too much coverage to the opulent lifestyle of the rich and the famous, it is a sending a wrong message to the society. People get influenced and start aspiring to have a materialist life. Unfortunately, this can lead to the demise of age old values that made us what we are today. Another reason for serving content that promotes good will is that it has an overall positive impact on the society. For example, coverage of motivational stories and sports inspire people to do something beneficial with their lives. Media is also responsible for dispensing vital information in critical situations. For instance, in the event of a natural calamity or the outbreak of a major epidemic the media should make use of its reach and create awareness among people. This is crucial to save lives.
In conclusion, due to its massive reach media has tremendous influence on the society; however, it should take utmost care to ensure that good news gets more coverage.",9,media-has-a-big-role-to-play-in-the-spreading-of-any-news-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
7,"Now we see a lot of comfort and convenience in the life of children. Their lifestyle has undergone a huge change in that their habits, activities and even social behavior are not what they used to be earlier. Which factors are responsible for this kind of change, and is it desirable or not?","Generally speaking, the lifestyle of children has improved considerably over the years. Today they enjoy many comforts and amenities that their parents had not even heard of in their childhood. The main causes of this change are the advances made in the field of technology and the growing income of families.
The number of households with disposable income is steadily increasing. As a result, the vast majority of children living in the developed and developing countries today have enough to eat. They can go to school, wear nice clothes and live in comfortable houses with amenities such as heating and cooling. The main advantage of this change is that it has made kids’ lives more comfortable. Unfortunately, at the same time, it has made children unhealthy. Today they eat more junk food than healthy food and rarely flex their muscle. While the previous generation used to play outside in their leisure time, today young people stay glued to their smart screens whenever they get an opportunity. Unfortunately, this sedentary lifestyle has led to various lifestyle diseases among children. While diseases like heart trouble and diabetes only affected the elderly in the past, now they are common even among young children.
Technology has also brought considerable amount of comfort to children’s lives. Most children now go to school in a car or on a bus. They rarely walk even for short distances. In their spare time they watch TV or play computer games. While these activities can help them beat stress, studies have shown that prolonged exposure to the television or the computer hurts the attention span of children. In addition, juveniles who spend long hours on the computer tend to have lower grades and fewer real friends. They become introverts and sometimes even socially aloof. Little wonder that instances of psychological disorders like depression are rising among youngsters.
To conclude, thanks to advances in technology and growing levels of affluence children today certainly enjoy many comforts that did not even exist 20 years ago. However, this can hardly be considered a positive trend because it has disastrous consequences for their physical and emotional wellbeing.",9,now-we-see-a-lot-of-comfort-in-the-life-of-children-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
8,Computer and online gaming should be banned for students at school as they have no educational value.,"Nowadays, computer and online games are extremely popular among students. Some people insist that children should be prohibited from playing these games at school because they do not serve any educational purpose. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, games should not be banned because they do offer certain benefits and some of them are educational. However, teachers should limit the amount of time children can play such games.
To begin with, young people are fascinated by electronic gadgets. They play games whenever they get an opportunity. This certainly is bad because playing online games for long hours affects the health and academic progress of students. Even so, banning them at school is not the solution because they do offer many benefits to students. Computer games help children unwind after a boring lecture or practical session. Nowadays, children are under tremendous academic pressure. They need a short break every few hours. If they are made to sit in the classroom for hours on end listening to lectures, their grades will only suffer. Asking them to play outside is possible only during favourable weather conditions. Inclement weather will confine kids to the classroom and during those times, online games provide them the much needed relaxation. Also, playing online games allows them to enhance their cognitive and problem solving skills. These games require a great deal of concentration and can actually boost the brain development of children when played in moderation.
However, it is important for teachers to limit the amount of time children get to play these games. Studies have shown that sitting in front of a computer or a console can cause eyestrain, headache and several other health problems. Also, excessive gaming may make children aloof and they may refuse to socialize with their peers, friends and neighbours. This will hurt their self confidence and also divert their attention from their studies. Hence, gaming should be permitted for only limited amounts of time.
In conclusion, online games educate and entertain kids; hence, they should not be banned at schools. However, it is important to limit the amount of time children can play online.",9,computer-and-online-gaming-should-be-banned-at-school-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
9,Positive and negative effects of technology through mass media,"Mass media plays a crucial role in our everyday life, and it is widely used to stay in touch with our near and dear ones and also to communicate messages with our peer groups. In my opinion, mass media does have some demerits, but those are negligible compared to the advantages it brings to our lives.
To begin with, through radio, television and internet programs people can gain knowledge and information on almost every topic. For example, they can find health information, learn about environmental issues and stay updated on science and technology through mass media programmes. The radio, for example, is a major source of information for people living in remote areas. It enables them to stay abreast of the latest developments in the world.  If there were no radio, perhaps it would take them weeks or even months to receive national and international news. Television and the internet provide not only entertainment but also knowledge. For example, both children and adults can learn a lot about science, technology, history and wildlife through television channels such as Discovery and National Geographic. Obviously, mass media benefits our lives in numerous ways.
On the flip side, it does have some negative aspects. To start with, mass media can be quite addictive and it is not uncommon for people to spend inordinate amounts of time in front of their television or computer. Unfortunately, this practice hurts their health. It may also affect their social skills because couch potatoes are less likely to go out and interact with others. Another downside is that some content on the television and the internet is not appropriate for children. For example, if children get exposed to violent or obscene visual content, it can affect their behaviour.
In conclusion, the benefits offered by mass media certainly outweigh its downsides. Even so, it is important for users to limit the time spent on electronic devices to limit their exposure to harmful content and to ensure that they stay healthy and socially active.",9,positive-and-negative-effects-of-technology-through-mass-media-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
10,Companies top-level authorities should get their employees in decision-making.,"It is often debated whether employers should involve their employees in the decision-making process. In my opinion, they should. When employees have their say in the management of the company, they will be able to make greater contributions.
Employees feel valued when the management listens to their suggestions. This makes them feel loyal to the company and they are less likely to leave. Attrition is one of the main problems that many organizations face today and one of the factors that force employees to leave an organization is that they have no involvement in the management of the company. By keeping employees in the loop about all things relevant to them, the company can enhance their idea of self worth.
In addition, bringing staff members on board for project planning strengthens the relationship between the management and the workers and ultimately increases the productivity of the organization. For example, when sales executives are allowed to participate in the monthly sales target meeting they will get the opportunity to raise their opinions and concerns regarding the sales strategies and recommend new sales markets. This enables them to estimate revenue and risks.
Likewise, when employees are directly involved in decision making they take ownership for their actions. They realize that the success as well as the failure of the organization depends on them. Obviously, this is a great reason for them to give their best to the organization.
In conclusion, involving staff members in the decision-making process is beneficial for all and helps to raise the profit margin of the organization.",9,companies-should-get-their-employees-in-decision-making
11,"Governments and big companies should work together to reverse environmental damage, rather than making individuals responsible for that. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and relevant examples.","According to some people, the onus is on governments and large industries to solve environmental issues, and not on individuals. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, everyone has the responsibility to contribute their bit to reverse environmental damage. Of course, governments and large corporations can do more, but this does not mean that individuals have no responsibility.
Governments can help solve environmental issues by enacting strict laws that prevent deforestation and illegal mining. For example, illegal sand mining has destroyed many rivers in India. Strict laws are needed to prevent this practice. Likewise, the clearing of forest land for building industries and residential spaces should be stopped with stringent laws. In addition, the government should support the use of renewable sources of energy like solar and wind. It can incentivize companies conducting research in this field and offer subsidies to encourage people to install solar panels on their rooftops. Promotion of electronic vehicles is another way to reduce environmental damage. Only governments can take such measures.
Industries are the biggest polluters and as such they have a greater role than anyone else to reverse at least some of the damage caused by them. They can do this by investing in eco-friendly technologies. Manufacturing companies must ensure that they do not dump untreated waste into water bodies. Likewise, they must limit the use of plastic for packaging. Large businesses can also drive various environmental promotion drives.
Individuals like you and me have to contribute our bit too. We can do this by adopting responsible consumption. We must resist the temptation to buy products we do not need. We need to realize that our use and throw culture is causing a great deal of damage to the planet. If everyone practices thoughtful consumption of the available resources, we can prevent further damage to the environment.
In conclusion, environmental issues cannot be solved by any particular person or authority. Collective efforts of individuals, companies and governments are required to arrest the damage caused to the environment.",9,governments-and-companies-should-work-together-to-reverse-environmental-damage-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
12,Do you think English will remain to be a global language despite globalisation?,"Throughout the world, English is considered as a link language that enables speakers of different mother tongues to communicate with one another. Some people argue that in this age of globalization, English may get replaced by another prominent language. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, instead of shaking the prominence of English as a global language, globalization will only reinforce it.
English has more speakers than any other language in the world. Actually, the majority of them speak English as a second language. This is a clear indication of its popularity outside of English speaking countries like the USA, the UK and Australia. No other language enjoys this kind of reach.
Of course, languages like Mandarin and Hindi are gaining prominence because many businesses are moving to China and India. This, however, does not mean that Mandarin or Hindi will replace English. While it is true that these languages have a considerable number of speakers within their countries, they are almost never used outside. This is not the case with English.
Another factor that bolsters the popularity of English is the fact that much of the scientific literature is written in English. In other words, anyone who wants to stay abreast of the developments in science and technology need to know English. In addition, the vast majority of websites on the internet are in English. That means people who have a working knowledge of English have access to an endless pool of information. That explains why even countries like China and Japan have started teaching English in schools.
To conclude, English is the language of opportunity and communication. As trade and commerce increase between countries, other languages may also gain more speakers. However, the argument that they will replace English as the language of communication does not hold water in view of the points mentioned above.",9,will-english-remain-a-global-language-despite-globalisation-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
13,Cities are now expanding; should the government make a better network for public transport or should they build more roads to facilitate car ownership? To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"More and more people are migrating to cities in search of better job opportunities and lifestyle. The expansion of cities, unfortunately, causes many problems. Traffic congestion is one of them. Some people argue that building better transport networks is the most effective way to solve this problem. Others insist that the government should build more roads to make way for the growing number of private vehicles. In my opinion, both measures are required to tackle the traffic problems plaguing large cities.
Improving public transport is unarguably the most effective way to make cities more livable. When buses and trains run on time and provide connectivity all over the city, few people will want to drive their own vehicles. This will automatically reduce the number of private vehicles on the road. When there are fewer cars on the road, there will be no traffic jams. Another advantage of having fewer vehicles on the road is that air quality will automatically improve. Respiratory problems caused by air pollution affect almost everyone living in the cities and a reliable public transport system will help everyone breathe easily.
Building more roads and improving existing infrastructure is also important. More roads enhance connectivity and in most cases they also reduce the distance between two parts of the city and thus reduce travelling time. Another advantage of building more roads is that it will reduce road mishaps and save many lives.
In conclusion, improving the frequency and reliability of public transport is definitely one way of resolving traffic issues affecting metropolises. Building more roads is another measure worth considering.",9,the-government-should-make-a-better-network-for-public-transport-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
14,"A government has a responsibility to its citizens to ensure their safety. Therefore, some people think that the government should increase spending on defense but spend less on social benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The primary role of the state is to protect its citizens from different types of threat. Therefore, some people argue that the government should direct much of its financial resources to the defense sector and cut down the spending on social welfare. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, a country has to spend on both social welfare and defense.
There is no denying the fact that a powerful military can ensure the safety of the citizens and maintain peace in a country. A strong military deters aggressive neighbours or terrorists from attacking a country and thereby prevents the loss of innocent lives and property. Moreover, in some countries, military can help with law enforcement and promote political stability by maintaining the sovereignty of the government. Therefore, it is crucial for a government to allocate a sufficient amount of funding to the defense sector.
However, the spending on military cannot be at the expense of social spending because the social welfare is as critical as military might for a country to thrive. The government is responsible to ensure that all the people can satisfy their basic human needs such as food, shelter and health care. By providing welfare for the neediest members of the society through various schemes, the state can improve their living standards and make its people happy and contented.  If there were no social benefit programs such as retirement schemes, disability benefits or subsidized housing, the vulnerable sections of the society would suffer. This can lead to resentment among the disadvantaged sections of the society and social uprising against the authorities. Moreover, citizens are entitled to receive benefits because they pay taxes to the government. Nowadays, only those countries which put great importance on social security can prosper. For example, Canada is a thriving country whose citizens enjoy almost free healthcare.
In conclusion, the state should give as much importance to the welfare of the citizens as to their safety and it will do more harm than good if it reduces the spending on social welfare for increasing military expenditure.",9,the-government-should-increase-spending-on-defense-and-spend-less-on-social-benefits-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
15,Should Government spend money on art when they have so many other important issues?,"There is no denying the fact that the government has to take care of several pressing issues such as poverty, unemployment and illiteracy. This is particularly true in the case of developing countries. However, this does not mean that the government should not spend money on arts.
Art represents a country and its heritage. Take, for instance, the case of India. The country is famous for its exquisitely sculpted monuments, temples and palaces. They were the handiwork of artists of the bygone era. Even today, the temples and monuments at Konark, Rajasthan and Madurai attract tens of thousands of local and international tourists. They showcase the rich cultural history of the country and elevate its status. If the kings of those times had not patronised art and artists we would not have these monuments to show off now. Not only the monuments but other forms of art like dance and music also need to be preserved for future generations. Otherwise, we will lose touch with our roots.
Government funding is crucial for the existence of arts. Art itself does not generate much revenue and hence artists, especially the lesser-known ones, have to struggle to make a living. This deters many of them from pursuing art as a profession. The only way to kindle their passion is to provide them financial assistance. By doing so, the government can not only protect its artists from starvation but also preserve his cultural legacy. Spending money on arts is also a way of generating money and creating employment. For example, if the government conducts art festivals and exhibitions, they will attract a lot of visitors and return the investment. Such events also provide employment to a number of people. Thus, it is evident that spending on arts is not a waste of resources.
To conclude, it is important for the government to invest in various social and economic welfare schemes. Likewise, it is equally important to invest in arts.",9,should-government-spend-money-on-arts-when-they-have-so-many-other-important-issues-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
16,Parents should be held legally responsible for their children’s acts. What is your opinion? Support it with personal examples.,"No doubt, parents play a crucial role in shaping the character of their children. Children imbibe both the good and the bad traits of their parents. Needless to say, kids coming from good families tend to behave well whereas those coming from bad or dysfunctional families are more likely to get into trouble. Since children are too young to understand what is right or wrong, it is the responsibility of parents to guide them in the right direction. Hence, I agree with the argument that parents should be held responsible for the actions of their minor children.
Children have impressionable minds. They acquire their values and morals from their parents. For instance, kids born in a good family often listen to good words and moral stories from the elderly family members. Therefore, when they find themselves in a difficult or unfavourable situation, they know how to keep their emotions in check and behave politely. This restraint that they learn from their family will prevent them from acting aggressively and getting into trouble.
By contrast, a child coming from a bad family may assimilate the bad qualities of their parents. Since they often get exposed to verbal and physical abuse they will assume that violence and aggression are normal and acceptable. It is only a matter of time before they commit crimes outside the home. For example, in India, the mother of a 14 years old boy was penalized for allowing her son to drive a four wheeler. The boy caused an accident and the judge who heard the case held his mother responsible because in his opinion it was her duty to prevent her underage son from driving. Thus, obviously, parents are responsible for the actions of their children.
To conclude, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that the role of parents in raising law abiding citizens with social commitment is of utmost importance. Hence, I believe that parents should be held accountable for the wrong acts of their children.",9,parents-should-be-held-legally-responsible-for-their-childrens-acts-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
17,Some people think that watching sports in one’s free time is just waste of time. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Some people hold the opinion that it is such a waste of free time to watch sport. I disagree with this view. In my opinion, watching sports can enhance bonding within communities and promote a healthier lifestyle among individuals.
Watching sport on television or from the gallery is an opportunity for people to come together and cheer for their team. Fans watching the game together may have different status in life and they may endorse different religious beliefs or political ideologies. However, when they watch the game, they have only one concern in the world and that is to see their team emerge victorious. Obviously, sporting events bring people closer and help them forget their differences. When their team wins an international match, it is celebration time for all of them. Sports even ignite patriotic feelings in people.
Community bonding is not the only benefit of watching sports. When people watch their favourite sportspersons in action, they feel encouraged to stay fit and live a healthier life. Teenagers, in particular, adore sporting heroes and want to emulate their lifestyle. Needless to say, people who watch sports matches regularly tend to live physically active lives. They are also healthier. For example, a recent study showed that there was a 30% increase in gym memberships during the recently held World Cup Football championship. By contrast, watching other television shows or engaging in other activities during free time does not produce this effect. This is because the content is less inspiring and it does not motivate people to change their lifestyle. Thus, it is evident that watching sports in free time motivates people to engage in physical activity and live healthier lives.
To conclude, watching sports is not a waste of time. It promotes stronger bonding within communities and leaves a positive impact on people by encouraging them to pursue a healthy way of life.",9,some-people-think-that-watching-sports-in-ones-free-time-is-just-a-waste-of-time-band-9-ielts-essay-sample

32,"When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is sometimes argued that salary should be the most important concern when one decides whether a job is worth pursuing. Although I concede that earning a decent salary is important to one’s well-being, there is no evidence to show that it is the most crucial factor.
On the one hand, I admit that people have to take into consideration how much they will be paid when they search for a job. There is indeed a strong correlation between the size of a person’s salary and their level of happiness. Nowadays, with the rising living standards and cost of living, people need to earn a reasonable amount of salary in order to meet their everyday expenses, such as food, transport, rent, clothing and the like. Without a decent income, one would find it hard to survive in the contemporary society. In addition, one’s salary is very often a determinant of one’s social standing. In other words, in the perspective of many people, a person’s success, to a large extent, depends upon the size of their salary.
However, I would argue that there are other factors that are equally essential to people’s sense of well-being, and that the argument that salary is the most important consideration when choosing a job is logically flawed, because such a claim cannot be backed up by evidence. For one thing, one’s working environment matters a lot to one’s psychological and physical wellbeing. Given the fact that most people work 9-to-5 jobs which require them to spend at least one-third of their day at their workplaces, it is crucial for them to have friendly and understanding co-workers and superiors. And for another, other factors such as the skills, knowledge and experience one acquires from the job may also play an important role in one’s overall sense of achievement, which is another form of happiness. This sense of achievement is often associated with optimism which is an enduring perception of well-being, compared with the temporary and brief satisfaction brought about by a sizable salary and the materialistic things that one can afford to buy with that salary.
In conclusion, while money matters a lot, there are other considerations that prove to be equally important. And so far there is no research which shows that a fat salary trumps all other factors in terms of the role they play in making one happy.",9,salary-is-the-most-important-consideration-when-choosing-a-job-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
33,Parents are the best teachers for their children. Do you agree or disagree?,"According to some people, parents make the best teachers for their children. I fully agree with this view because parents are the greatest influence on any child and the upbringing that they give will determine what the child will ultimately become in their life.
Parents are the first and foremost influence on any child. For many children, during the first few years of their life, parents are the only people in their life. They learn all important life skills from their father and mother. Parents not only teach their children to walk and talk, but also play a crucial role in shaping their character.
The seeds of character are sown during childhood and if children receive the right upbringing grounded on moral values, they will stay true to their conscience throughout their lives. By contrast, children raised by parents who lack moral values are more likely to become criminals when they grow up. That is because children learn a lot by observing and imitating. They observe each and every action of their parents and do exactly what their dad or mom does. So, for example, if children find that their parents are always honest in their dealings, they learn the importance of becoming honest. Such children will not become corrupt when they grow up. Likewise, parents who treat their servants or drivers with kindness and compassion are knowingly or unknowingly developing empathy in their children.
Parents are also the ones who encourage children to study hard and achieve their goals. Unlike teachers, parents have a vested interest in their children’s lives. They want their children to do well in life and bring honour to the family. Because of this reason, they never give up on their children. By contrast, in most cases, the contribution of the teachers at school or college is limited to helping their students learn their subjects.
To conclude, learning is not limited to mastering the concepts of science or mathematics. True learning happens outside the classroom and here parents are the ones who impart all important life lessons. Hence, the argument that parents are the best teachers for their children makes perfect sense.",9,parents-are-the-best-teachers-for-their-children-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
34,Most people prefer ready to eat food rather than homemade food now. Do you think it has more advantages or more disadvantages.,"The modern lifestyle and hectic schedules are encouraging more and more people to consume ready to eat food. In my opinion, it is a negative trend because readymade food lacks nutrition and its regular consumption will lead to various health problems.
Everybody is busy these days. In most families now both parents work and neither has time to cook proper meals at home. Readymade food that can be bought from stores is hugely popular with these people because it helps them save time. Also, in some cases, packaged meals are less expensive than regular homemade meals. Better still, they are available in a variety of tastes and flavours. All of these factors encourage the consumption ready to eat meals. Unfortunately, convenience is the only advantage of ready to eat meals.
Regular consumption of readymade food leads to various health problems in people. They contain high levels of preservatives and additives that can cause various diseases like cancer and kidney trouble. Also, fast food is full of calories and deficient in nutrients. If it is consumed on a regular basis, it will lead to obesity, diabetes and heart trouble. It is also addictive and makes people want to consume it again and again. Children are the worst affected by fast food consumption. During their developmental stage, they need a lot of nutrition which only home cooked meals can provide. Needless to say, kids who subsist on a diet of fast food tend to have developmental issues. They may also suffer from behavioural issues because the high sugar and energy content of junk food can make them restless and hyperactive.
To conclude, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that there are more disadvantages than advantages to the consumption of fast food.  Readymade food certainly makes our lives more comfortable by eliminating the need to cook. Unfortunately, it also makes us unhealthy by depriving us of essential nutrients.",9,most-people-prefer-to-eat-ready-to-eat-food-rather-than-homemade-food-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
35,"The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home to work, shopping and education. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Traffic congestion caused by automobiles has become a major issue in almost all cities all over the world. Some people opine that reducing the need for people to travel is the best way to reduce traffic congestion. In my opinion, this approach will certainly help; however, it has its downsides.
Thanks to advancements in technology, it is now possible for people to perform most tasks without having to step outside. For example, they can buy just about anything they need online. They can also pay bills online. In fact, many organizations already allow their employees to work from home. In future, as access to technology improves more and more businesses and establishments will offer the work from option. Likewise, many universities now offer their courses online. By simply encouraging more students to study online and more people to work from home, the government can reduce traffic and vehicular pollution to a great extent.
However, this approach does have its side effects. If people stop traveling, millions of drivers employed by the travel industry will lose their livelihood. This will have a massive impact on the economy. Any reduction in the amount of traveling will also reduce the demand for cars, motorbikes and buses. So, obviously, the automobile industry will be hit hard and people employed in this sector will lose their jobs. There are many more drawbacks. When people perform every activity online, there will be a dramatic decline in face to face interactions. Eventually, this will lead to many psychological and socio-cultural problems. For example, lack of interactions with others may trigger depression in some people. In other words, the disadvantages of reducing the need to travel will outweigh its advantages. Hence, in my opinion, a better solution is to build wider roads and create more job opportunities in the countryside. This will stop the migration of rural folks into urban areas and thus reduce the congestion in cities.
To conclude, eliminating the need the travel will certainly reduce traffic congestion everywhere; unfortunately, this move will create more problems than it solves.",9,the-only-way-to-reduce-the-amount-of-traffic-in-cities-is-to-reduce-the-need-for-people-to-travel-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
36,The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.,"Nowadays, it is common for people to pursue more than one career at the same time or to switch their line of work frequently. Actually, people of all ages are enrolling in various regular and online courses to acquire new skills and qualifications. The concept of studying until a certain age and pursuing a single career afterwards is now passé. In my opinion, growing ambition and availability of new and exciting opportunities are the factors that encourage this trend.
People want to achieve more and more. They are not content with what they have. Their social feed is full of the success stories of their old class mates and they want to emulate them. For most people, pursuing more than one career is the only way to achieve their ambitions in life. So, doctors are working as lecturers at various institutes in their spare time. IT and management professionals are dedicating their weekends for building their own start-up. Everybody is exploring all possible ways of finding an extra source of income. And to cater to the needs of these zealous job hoppers both online and offline skill development courses are available.
Soaring competition also encourages many adults to seek excellence in more than one area. Job security is no longer available in many sectors. People may lose their job anytime and to protect themselves against such catastrophic scenarios, they are working two or three jobs. For example, a salesman may work not only as a marketing executive but also as a real-estate agent. A journalist may run a blog in his spare time. No one wants to take chances with their financial security and stability.
The availability of more opportunities also motivates many enthusiasts to adopt multiple careers. Thanks to the advent of the internet and telecommuting, people now have the option of working from anywhere. This enables them to freelance without quitting their full time job.
To conclusion, ambition and the lack of job security are the factors that drive people to pursue multiple careers. The availability of new opportunities just made this easier for them.",9,the-idea-of-having-a-single-career-is-becoming-an-old-fashioned-one-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
37,"The position of women in society has changed markedly in the last twenty years. Many of the problems young people now experience, such as juvenile delinquency, arise from the fact that many married woman now work and are not at home to care for their children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Most women are now coming out of their traditional role as a homemaker and joining professions that were once dominated by men. As a result, they get to spend less time with their children. According to some people, working mothers who do not have enough time for their children may trigger behaviour problems and criminal tendencies in them. In my opinion, this is just one of the many factors that lead to juvenile crime.
If we examine the profile of teenage criminals we can see that they come from all sorts of family backgrounds. If all of them had working moms, it would be easy to establish a link between juvenile delinquency and mother’s neglect but that is rarely the case. Many young criminals have stay at home mothers who have all the time in the world for their children. Yet, their children take to crime. One reason for this is poverty. Many teenagers who commit crimes come from very poor family backgrounds. Another factor that encourages crime is the lack of education. Actually, children coming from families where both parents work are less likely to have to cope with poverty or illiteracy and this may reduce their chances of committing crime.
At the same time, lack of parental supervision is a cause for concern. If parents are not around children may get into wrong company or they may spend all the time in front of the computer or television. For example, children may befriend criminals who lead them astray or they may access violent or harmful content on the internet or television. Both factors increase their chances of becoming criminals. Hence, mothers who are always busy with work certainly increase their children’s chances of turning into criminals.
However, asking women to stop going to work is not the solution for teenage crime. Instead of giving up on their career for the sake of their children, women should get the help of trusted family members or a caretaker to supervise their children. It is also important for them to spend quality time with their children whenever that is possible. No matter how busy a woman is, the truth is that it is still possible for her to enquire about her children’s day and stay updated about the happenings in their life. It is important for mothers to realize that their achievements will lack shine if their children end up becoming criminals and non-achievers.
To conclude, mother’s neglect could be a factor that promotes criminal activities among teenagers but it is neither the only factor nor the most important cause of juvenile misconduct. Having said that, both working and non-working mothers can reduce their children’s chances of becoming criminals by being a pillar of constant support for them.",9,problems-like-juvenile-delinquency-arise-from-the-fact-that-many-married-woman-now-work-and-are-not-at-home-to-care-for-their-children-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
38,Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on young children. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"According to some people regular use of computers has more negative than positive impacts on children. I do not agree with this view. While I do admit that excessive use of computers can harm children in many ways, these gadgets are also crucial for their success and hence we cannot stop them from using computers.
Computers have their downsides. Children can play games and watch movies on them. Needless to say, it is quite normal for children who use the computer every day to get addicted to it. If they spend too much time on their computer, they will lose their focus on studies and their grades will suffer. Children who use the computer for long hours are also more likely to develop health problems like obesity because of their sedentary lifestyle. Excessive screen time can also cause vision problems in children.
On the flip side, in this day and age when computers are used in all spheres of life, it is foolish to stop children from using them. They need proficiency in computers to be able to find a good job in future. Actually, nowadays, they need computers to even score good marks in exams. Hence instead of preventing children from using computers, parents and teachers should encourage moderate use. Children should be allowed to use the computers for one or two hours at the most. Parents must also ensure that children are not wasting time playing games on the computer or accessing online content that is not suitable for them. If used wisely, computers and the internet help children with their studies. Actually, there are numerous educational websites designed to make learning fun and interactive.
To conclude, after analysing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that moderate use of computers has more beneficial than negative effects on children. However, excessive and irresponsible use of computers is harmful and hence it must be prevented.",9,using-a-computer-every-day-can-have-more-negative-than-positive-effects-on-young-children-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
39,Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"According to some people, the role of a father in bringing up a child is as important as that of a mother and hence fatherhood must be lauded as much as motherhood. I fully agree with this view. Of course, the mother has a greater role than the father in bringing the child into this world, but once the baby is born both parents play an equal role in raising him.
A father’s affection for the child is as pure and invaluable as that of a mother. In addition, both parents have the same biological relation with the child. Of course, the mother has a slightly more important role in the first few months after the baby is born, but afterwards, their roles and responsibilities are more or less the same. Men’s idea of parenting has also changed dramatically over the years. Earlier many men only provided financially for the child and shied away from other responsibilities of fatherhood. But the new age father belongs to an altogether different species. He believes in sharing every aspect of parenting with his wife. Needless to say, the modern father plays with the child, cuddles him, changes his diapers and calms him down when he is crying. He ensures that the child is fed and clothed properly and helps with his studies and homework.
The modern mother also expects this of her husband. It is practically impossible for a woman to look after her child all the time and still pursue a demanding career. Needless to say, young mothers these days want their husbands to have the same role as them in raising the child. What’s more, whether or not the father plays an active role in the upbringing of the child, his son or daughter will always feel more secure and protected under his wings. For example, if a child is harassed by a bully, the father is the first person he approaches for support. If the father wasn’t important, the child would not turn to him in the first place. What’s more, in many families, the role of the father is not limited to providing emotional support. He is also the bread winner. He is the one who provides for the child and his mother.
In conclusion, the inalienable blood relation and the emotional bond that the father shares with the child make fatherhood as important as motherhood. Also, I believe the idyllic joy of parenthood is as unique and special for a father as it is for a mother.",9,fatherhood-ought-to-be-emphasized-as-much-as-motherhood-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
40,"Children have more and more tests and exams at school, sometimes starting from the age of five or six right up until the age of 18. What are the advantages and disadvantages of making children do exams?","Students have to appear for too many exams these days. Actually periodic written and oral assessments have become an integral aspect of even primary education. In my opinion, exams are both good and bad. The merits and demerits of conducting a large number of exams at school will be discussed in this essay.
The main advantage of conducting more examinations is that teachers can assess the subject knowledge and understanding of students in a more structured way. Exams, after all, are a time tested way of assessing a student’s intelligence and commitment to learning. What’s more, exams and grades act as a benchmark and facilitate the process of selection for higher studies. For example, students scoring above 85 percent in all modules in their final board exams alone can secure admission in top science colleges.
Another benefit of conducting multiple tests is that it helps children to cope with the pressures of the real life. It is no secret that students who appear for periodic assessments are better at handling stressful situations. This quality will stand them in good stead when they enter the real world outside school.
On the other hand, too many exams are more likely to increase the stress level of children and take a toll on their health. Comparison with fellow students and parental pressure to excel in each exam can further deteriorate children’s mental stability. For instance, some pupils are weak in certain subjects and they may consistently score low marks in those subjects. Their inability to improve their grades may hurt their confidence and cause further deterioration of their grades. In worst case scenarios exam pressure can trigger depression in academically poor students.
To sum it up, conducting too many exams can definitely help examiners to assess children’s potential. It can also help children to brace themselves for the competition ahead. However, at the same time, the constant pressure of repetitive evaluations can be detrimental for some students, especially those who are weak in academics. It is important that parents and teachers work with them closely and provide them counseling if they need it.",9,children-have-more-and-more-tests-and-exams-at-school-what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-making-children-do-exams-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
41,"Many people try to find a balance between their work and other aspects of their life. However, few actually achieve this. What solutions can you suggest?","Everybody wants to achieve some balance between their work and life. Unfortunately, not many people manage to do this. There are several reasons for this. There are also some solutions.
Having the right priorities is essential for achieving work life balance. For example, people who put their family above work must not commit the mistake of accepting a job that requires them to spend long hours at the workplace. Such jobs will earn them good salaries but they will most probably have to sacrifice their personal life. If we look around we can see that most people who complain about the lack of work life balance are highly paid executives. They cannot have time for their family because of the demanding nature of their job and this is something they need to have realized before accepting such jobs. Hence, for people who really want to find some time for themselves and their family, it is better to choose a job with reasonable working hours and salary. In other words, it is essential to set our priorities right before we can even attempt to achieve work life balance.
Time management is also crucial. Every person wastes a lot of time in a day doing things that are useless. For example, most people these days spend inordinate amounts of time on social media. They are just wasting this time because there is nothing that they can accomplish by updating their social media status on an hourly basis. People who seek time for their family life must stay away from such time wasters. It is also important for people to focus on one thing at a time. At work, their focus must be on their work because this simple strategy will enable them to finish their jobs faster and find time for their family. Another factor that hurts work life balance is the employee’s tendency to bring work home. This must be avoided unless it is really important.
To conclude, knowing one’s priorities is the key to achieving proper work life balance. Time management is crucial. Having realistic goals and ambitions is equally important.",9,many-people-try-to-find-a-balance-between-their-work-and-other-aspects-of-life-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
42,There has been an increase in the number of children and youngsters committing crime. What are the reasons for this? What punishments should they receive?,"Over the past few years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of crimes committed by teenagers. There are several reasons for this and the most important among them is the influence of the media. Poverty and illiteracy also encourage many teens to get into crime. Young people committing serious crimes should receive the same punishment as adults. That is the most effective way to curb juvenile crime.
Young people who watch a lot of violent programmes on television and the internet have higher chances of getting into crime than their peers who do not watch such shows. Juveniles have impressionable minds and as such it is quite easy for them to get influenced by what they watch. Needless to say, they commit crimes without even fully understanding the consequences of their action. The family background is another major influence on children. Children coming from poor or dysfunctional families are more likely to get involved in anti-social activities. Oftentimes, they do not have a role model in life and get into bad company. Peer pressure is another factor that influences children. Youngsters may pick up habits like smoking or drinking under the influence of their peers. They may even steal money to have the same lifestyle as their friends.
Giving the right punishment is crucial for dealing with juvenile crime. Young people committing heinous crimes should be treated like adults and receive the same punishment. In many countries, this is not the case and juveniles are treated leniently. This has to change. Stringent punishments will automatically act as a deterrent and force teens to think twice before they do something illegal. Parents and teachers can also play an important role in checking juvenile crime. Parents should monitor their children’s activities and the company they keep.
In conclusion, crime is crime whether it is committed by a teenager or an adult. The only way to control teenage crime rates is to enforce strict laws that make teenagers think twice before breaking the law.",9,there-has-been-an-increase-in-the-number-of-children-committing-crime-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
43,"Some People prefer online classes, while others think that it is better to be in a traditional classroom. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Nowadays, online classes have become more popular and many students enrol in them. There are, nonetheless, some learners who still prefer traditional classroom learning. In my opinion, traditional courses and online courses both have their merits; even so, I feel that online courses are better than regular classroom courses in many ways.
Online classes certainly have numerous advantages associated with them. To start with, they are much cheaper than traditional courses. By enrolling in an online programme, poor students who cannot afford expensive collage education can acquire valuable skills and earn degrees, that too from the comfort of their home. Another advantage of online courses is their flexibility. You can take them whenever you want and from wherever you are. By contrast, in order to do a regular course, you have to be in a classroom at a specific time. If you cannot make it at that time, you will miss the class. This is not the case with online learning. The ease of taking the class at a time convenient to the learner has made it quite popular among working professionals who want to upgrade their skills.
By contrast, traditional classroom learning also has its benefits. The most important among them is the better interaction between the teacher and the student. A machine can only deliver the lessons; it cannot figure out whether the student has understood the concepts. A teacher, on the other hand, can easily figure out whether the student has understood something by simply looking at their face. As a result, teachers can clear doubts then and there and this helps with the progress of the student. Yet, the lack of flexibility and higher costs make traditional learning an unviable option for many students.
To conclude, after analysing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that traditional learning and online learning have their merits and demerits. However, in my opinion, online learning is better because it makes education accessible to almost everyone – even people who have a full time job.",9,some-people-prefer-online-classes-while-others-prefer-classroom-learning-band-9-ielts-essay-sample

Some people opine that it will be good for the environment if people only eat locally produced food. I agree with this view to a certain extent. In my opinion, consumption of local food will create jobs in the local economy and help the environment, but if people eat only locally produced food, they will have fewer choices.
Environmental problems are a highly debated topic these days. Huge amounts of fossil fuels have to be burned to transport food to distant places. This causes considerable damage to the environment. There will be a massive reduction in the consumption of oil if people start preferring locally grown food and hence it is good for the planet. Another argument in favour of eating locally produced food is its nutrient value. Locally grown food is nutritious because it is free of preservatives. Also, locally grown fruits and vegetables are plucked when they ripen and this retains their nutritional content. By contrast, when they are transported from a distant place, they are plucked when they are still raw and then ripened with the help of chemicals. Regular consumption of such food items will lead to health problems in people.
Even so, in my opinion, eating locally produced food alone is not a viable option because there is a limit to the kind of food that can be grown in each place. For example, fruits like apples and grapes can only be grown in cold climates. Likewise, some fruits and vegetables only grow in hot climates. There are also many regions that are not suitable for cultivation. If people eat only what is available in their region, they choices will be limited. Hence, in my opinion, locally grown food should be given preference. However, it should not be the only food available to people.
To conclude, if people give preference to the local produce, it will certainly benefit their health, the environment and the local economy. Even so, in my opinion, eating locally cultivated food alone is not a viable option because it will seriously limit the food choices people have.",9,foods-travels-thousands-of-miles-from-producers-to-consumers-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
45,"Some people think that allowing children to make their own choices on everyday matters such as food, clothes and entertainment is likely to result in a society of individuals who only think about their own wishes. Other people believe that it is important for children to make decision about matters that affect them. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","According to some people, children should be allowed to decide what they should eat, wear or watch. However, others opine that if children have the freedom to make their own choices, they will grow up into selfish individuals. In my opinion, children should definitely have the liberty to make their own decisions; however, since they are too young to understand what is good or bad for them, parents should help them make the right decisions.
It is important for a child to learn how to make decisions regarding his lifestyle or future career as decision making is an important skill for success in life. When he is allowed to make his own choices he will learn to take the responsibility for his actions. This is another skill required for success. Needless to say, a child who takes small decisions right from his childhood can deal with the conflicts and challenges in life more efficiently.
On the contrary, when children have total freedom to make their own choices, they may fail to consider the feelings of others. For example, a child may insist that he should be able to watch cartoon whenever he wants to. He may not consider what other members of the family want to watch on TV. If his parents allow him to have his way all the way, he will definitely grow into a selfish person who does not care for others. It is, therefore, important for parents to set the limits of the freedom their children can have.
In conclusion, I believe that even though children should be allowed to make their own choices, parents should teach them to respect the feelings of others; otherwise, they may end up becoming selfish.",9,some-people-think-that-allowing-children-to-make-their-own-choices-is-likely-to-result-in-a-society-of-individuals-who-only-think-about-their-own-wishes-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
46,Some governments say how many children a family can have in their country. They may control the number of children someone has through taxes. It is sometimes necessary and right for a government to control the population in this way. Do you agree or disagree?,"Controlling the burgeoning human population is the need of the hour. The global population is expected to cross 11.2 billion by the end of the 21st century and but according to statistics the earth cannot sustain more than 10 billion people. That means there is an urgent need to control the population growth. Some governments have already set a limit to the number of children a family can have and those who violate this rule are required to pay tax on the extra children. In my opinion, this is a viable measure that governments all over the world can implement.
To start with, imposing a tax on children who exceed the permitted number will send the right message to people. It will force lower and middle class families to limit the number of children they have. Affluent parents will also be influenced by this move because they will not want to expend their money in taxes for more children. The government can use the money thus collected for public welfare schemes.
Levying a tax on every second or third child will also indirectly make people realize the burden of population on the society. Parents will realize that every additional child destabilizes their financial security and hurts the economy of the nation. What’s more, this way of controlling the population sounds less harsh. Measures such as population awareness campaigns, celebrity endorsement and education programmes in schools are rather soft and ineffective. On the other hand, stringent steps such as forcible sterilization and a strict one child policy may outrage the citizens.
In summary, I believe that imposing taxes on children who exceed the permitted limit is an effective and rightful measure to control the population growth. It will convey the message that a family can have additional children only at their own expense.",9,some-governments-control-the-number-of-children-someone-can-have-through-taxes-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
47,It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children?,"Children’s behaviour and character almost always reflect what they have been taught by their parents and teachers. Since a person’s character is formed during their childhood, it is important for children to learn the difference between right. Many people opine that punishment is necessary for children to learn appropriate behaviour and values. I agree with this opinion to a great extent.
One of the reasons to punish a child when they do something wrong is to make them aware of the immoral act right away. When they are punished they will realize that their act was unacceptable and this will deter them from repeating the same offence. For example, a child uttering foul language or bullying others, if immediately reprimanded, is less likely to attempt this misbehaviour again.
As for the forms of punishments, in my opinion, parents and teachers should resort to only mild punishments. For example, at school, teachers can ask a child to stand outside the classroom. At home, parents can stop the child from watching their favourite TV show if they do not complete their homework or eat healthy food. Sometimes, an emotional punishment is even more helpful. For instance, parents can stop talking to their child for a while if they do something really bad.
Another way of punishing is to instil in children the fear of loss. Some children are not afraid of getting beaten, but they will definitely not want to lose something dear to them. Parents, for example, can stop giving them their pocket money or prevent them from playing with their pets or friends if they misbehave.
In conclusion, I feel that some sort of punishment is essential to guide the children about the difference between good and bad. However, at the same time, it should be ensured that harsh forms of corporal punishment such as beating or punching are not employed.",9,punishment-is-necessary-to-help-children-learn-the-difference-between-right-and-wrong-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
48,"In some countries the average weight of people is increasing, and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing. What do you think are the causes of these problems and what measures could be taken to solve them?","Despite knowing the detrimental impact of obesity on health, people around the world are getting heavier than before. This essay will examine the major causes of this issue and suggest some viable solutions to tackle it.
The main causes of increasing body weight and decreasing fitness levels are the sedentary lifestyle of people and excessive consumption of junk food. Fast food companies are spending millions of dollars to promote their products on TV and the internet. These commercials make unhealthy food seem extremely tempting and mouth-watering. As a result, people especially children unconsciously gorge on them. Unfortunately, excessive consumption of junk leads to obesity and health problems because obese people are more likely to develop diabetes and heart trouble.
Another factor contributing to growing cases of obesity is the sedentary lifestyle of people. Due to the growing academic and work pressure, children as well as adults do not get enough time to work out. Worse, even when people are free, instead of working out in a gym, they prefer to watch a movie on the TV or computer. This way of life has a negative impact on their health.
Promoting health awareness among people and enforcing strict censorship on food advertisements are the best ways to combat this issue. The government and the media should inform people of the harmful consequences of leading an inactive life. Once the public are aware of the negative effect of obesity, they are more likely to take actions to change their lifestyle. Another solution is to ban misleading food advertisements that target children. The government must ensure that food companies are not promoting unhealthy food as healthy.
To conclude, there is no denying the fact that the growing cases of obesity and decreasing levels of health are a major concern around the world. To combat this issue, the government should launch health awareness campaigns and ban misleading ads that encourage the consumption of fast food.",9,in-some-countries-the-average-weight-of-people-is-increasing-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
49,"When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","According to some people, salary is the first thing to consider when choosing a job. I agree with this statement to a great extent but in my opinion other factors like job satisfaction cannot be ignored.
Salary should definitely be the first consideration. No other factor has a greater impact on a person’s life or lifestyle than their income. The cost of living keeps increasing year after year and people are living under considerable financial stress these days. Everything from education and healthcare to food and housing has become expensive. If the salary is not adequate enough to meet the expenses, all aspects of a person’s life will be severely affected. In addition, if people are paid well, they will feel that the company appreciates their contribution. A good salary even elevates a person’s self image and social image. Obviously, it is not hard to see why most people give so much importance to the pay packet.
Having said that, salary cannot be the only consideration when choosing a job. Job satisfaction is equally important. The job should pay well; it should provide satisfaction as well. In addition, the work hours should be reasonable. Employees are also human beings and they seek work-life balance just like everyone else. A job may pay an astronomical remuneration, but if the working conditions are pathetic, it is foolish to take it. In my opinion, choosing a job that pays a little less but offers satisfactory working conditions is a much better idea.
To conclude, the remuneration should definitely be the first thing to consider when choosing a job because it is impossible to lead a comfortable life without a decent salary. However, money alone cannot make people happy and hence other factors like job satisfaction and working hours too should be considered before taking up a job.",9,when-choosing-a-job-salary-is-the-most-important-consideration-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
50,Some people believe that children’s leisure activities must be educational; otherwise they are a complete waste of time. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your experience.,"According to some people, every activity that children pursue in their leisure time should have some educational value. They believe that activities that do not teach anything are useless. I fully agree with this view.
When educational elements are made a part of leisure time activities, children learn effortlessly and with pleasure. In Sweden, for example, the government has passed a law that makes it mandatory for toymakers to incorporate some educational value into every toy they sell. This makes learning a fun activity for children.
In addition, leisure time activities that are educational in nature make the best use of children’s time. This approach also ensures that they do not waste their time doing activities that are harmful or useless. For example, lots of children all over the world play the Pokemon cards and waste countless hours gathering information about some fictitious characters. This is a complete waste of time. If these cards were replaced by some informative cards or if the characters were from history or mythology, the children would still have fun and at the same they would also acquire valuable knowledge. Thus it is evident that by simply making some changes to the toys and games in the market, we can help our children learn with fun and pleasure. Another advantage of educational leisure activities is that most of them require the active participation of parents. Thus they play an important role in strengthening the parent-child relationship.
To conclude, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that there are numerous benefits to adding some educational elements to free time activities. However, parents must ensure that the emphasis is on leisure and that learning does not become burdensome for the children.",9,some-people-believe-that-childrens-leisure-activities-must-be-educational-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
51,Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary schools rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"According to some academicians, it is better to introduce a foreign language in elementary school than in secondary school. I agree with this view. In my opinion, young children are better at acquiring a new language than older children. Also, learning an additional language at a young age enhances their IQ.
One of the major benefits of introducing a new language early on is that it helps the child gain higher levels of proficiency in it. As a matter of fact, I grew up speaking three different languages from the age of 3 and because of this I have utmost confidence in using all of them. If I didn’t learn these languages from such an early age, I doubt that I would be fluent in them. Another advantage of learning an additional language is that it enhances the child’s cognitive skills. Studies have shown that multilingual people are smarter than monolingual people. It is no surprise then that Albert Einstein spoke 5 different languages from a young age and he was undoubtedly one of the greatest minds on earth.
A potential disadvantage of learning multiple languages in primary school is that the child may confuse the foreign dialect and their native tongue. As a result, they may take longer to achieve fluency in their mother tongue. For example, we sometimes see that children born and brought up outside India have difficulty in conversing with their family in their native language. However, in my opinion, if parents make it a point to speak to their children in their mother tongue, this problem can be resolved easily. Another disadvantage of adding a new language to the primary school curriculum is that it puts an extra burden on children. Children already have a lot of subjects to learn and a new language can make the syllabus even heavier.
In conclusion, educating children to be multilingual from an early age promotes better language skills and a higher IQ in them. Parents and teachers just need to ensure that the new language does not become a burden for the kids.",9,it-is-better-for-children-to-begin-learning-a-foreign-language-from-primary-school-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
52,Some of the methods used in advertising are unethical and unacceptable in today’s society. To what extent do you agree with this view?,"There is a general belief that the advertising industry uses immoral and objectionable methods to promote their products. I fully agree with this view. In my opinion, most ads either make false claims or are highly misleading.
Advertisers try every trick in the book to sell their products. With the objective of grabbing more eyeballs, marketers often hire popular celebrities to endorse their products. When a popular actor or a successful sportsperson endorses a product people will assume that it is of a higher quality. For example, actors often promote beauty soaps, shampoos and creams. Gullible people buy those products hoping that if they use them, they will look like their idol. Such ads make false claims with the sole objective of increasing the sale of the product. Some companies market their products as something that only the rich can afford. The iPhone, for example, is ridiculously pricey and some cheaper phones have the same features and specifications. Yet, Apple’s marketing campaigns have made the iPhone a status symbol. Consequently, many lower and middle class people borrow money to buy it. Such campaigns are harmful and must be controlled.
Advertisements and promotions targeting children are even more dangerous. For example, the fast food chains MacDonald’s and Burger King give away free toys or drinks to attract children. Surveys have proved that their products are unhealthy and their regular consumption leads to health problems including obesity among children. Yet, these foods are marketed as healthy and nutritious. Creating awareness against the consumption of such foods alone will not help because children are too young to differentiate healthy and unhealthy food. Therefore, the government should either control the advertisements or ban them entirely.
To conclude, I would like to say that although advertising plays a key part in marketing products, false and misleading advertisements should be regulated or even banned.",9,some-of-the-methods-used-in-advertising-are-unethical-and-unacceptable-in-todays-society-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
53,"Today, more and more people choose to live by themselves. What are the causes of this? Is this a positive or negative development?","Many people are living alone these days. There are several reasons behind this trend and the most important among them are the need to acquire higher education and independence. In my opinion, living alone has more benefits than disadvantages.
Students often have to live alone. Prestigious universities are situated in metropolitan cities and hence students who want to study in these universities have to relocate to cities and live away from their parents. An advantage of this arrangement is that they will learn to cook, clean and manage their finances. And such skills are crucial for success in life. Professionals are also migrating to big cities in search of better job prospects. They also live away from their family. Some people choose to live alone because they cannot manage the monthly expenses if they live with their family. For example, many people who work in foreign countries do not take their family with them because of their inability to provide for them. They live alone and send their savings to their family living in their native place.
On the down side, there are some downsides to living alone. When people live alone it affects their relationship with their family members because of the lack of face to face interactions with them. What’s more, young people who live alone are more likely to get into bad company and develop harmful habits.
To conclude, even though living alone has become a popular trend and has its inherent advantages, people have to pay attention to its demerits in order to sustain family bonds. They also need to ensure that they are keeping good company.",9,today-more-and-more-people-choose-to-live-by-themselves-band-9-ielts-essay-sample-2
54,Some working parents think that childcare centres provide the best care for children who are still too young to go to school. Other working parents think that family members such as grandparents will be better care providers for their children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Finding the best support system for toddlers is a major concern for working parents. While some people argue that close relatives such as grandparents can provide the best care and support for young kids others insist that day care centres are a better option. In my opinion, grandparents are better care providers than the staff at day care centres.
Relatives, especially grandparents, have the best interests of the child in their mind. As a result, they give her their undivided attention. They also impart moral values that play a role in shaping the character of the child. Because of these reasons, close relatives make caregivers for the child. As a matter of fact, children who have been cared for by grandparents turn out to be more empathetic than those who never had the opportunity to interact with older people.
On the other hand, day care centres have their own advantages. They have trained employees who know how to cater to the needs of a preschooler. They also ensure that the child achieves some level of independence before starting elementary school. Despite these advantages, it is difficult for a crèche to provide the same care and warmth provided by grandparents. What’s more, studies have shown that children who attend a daycare centre are more stubborn and attention hungry than those who are cared for at home.
In conclusion, even though day-care centers can provide adequate levels of care and guidance for preschoolers they cannot match the love and dedication of a close relative. Therefore, if there is a relative willing to care for toddlers, working parents should consider that as the better option than day care centers.",9,some-working-parents-think-childcare-centres-provide-the-best-care-for-children-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
55,Some people think that intelligence is innate while others think that we can improve our intelligence through learning. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"While some people opine that intelligence is inherited, others insist that it can be acquired through learning. In my opinion, intelligence is both innate and acquired.
There are certainly some innate aspects to intelligence. That explains why children taught in the same class acquire different grades. Another interesting aspect of intelligence is that people have different skills or aptitude. For instance, some people have a natural flair for writing, singing or drawing. They can excel in these areas even if they do not receive formal training. Some students can solve arithmetic sums more easily and there are also children who have a natural aptitude for science. What’s more, although a number of people study science or arts, only a handful of them emerge as successful scientists or artists. Obviously, they have certain skills that others do not possess and that probably explains why intelligence is innate.
On the flip side, there are certainly some aspects of intelligence that can and should be acquired and developed. For example, just because someone is born ‘intelligent’ there is no guarantee that they will achieve great things in life. In almost all cases, they need training and practice. If intelligence was truly an innate quality, there would be no need for this training. There are also examples of many people who became great success in their life in spite of getting poor grades in school. Their intelligence certainly is not ‘innate’. Rather it is something they acquired through learning and practice.
To conclude, after analyzing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that intelligence is both innate and acquired. All of us are born with certain levels of intelligence. If an intelligent person is born in a conducive environment and receive adequate levels of external stimuli they can produce outstanding results. At the same time, someone born with only average levels of intelligence can also achieve great things through learning and hard work.",9,some-people-think-that-intelligence-is-innate-others-think-it-can-be-improved-through-learning-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
56,Today more people are travelling than ever before. Why is this the case? What are the benefits of traveling for the traveller?,"Each year, millions of people visit other countries and spend their leisure time there. Actually, the number of travelers is growing year after year. There are many reasons behind this trend and the most important among them is the rise in the income and living standards of people.
People are traveling because they can afford it. Thanks to advances in technology, air travel has become considerably cheap; as a result, more and more people can visit foreign countries. In addition, people have become more curious. They read about foreign countries on the internet and watch programmes on television. This exposure makes them want to visit those countries so that they can experience everything first hand. They want to taste exotic dishes they have never eaten before and celebrate unique and colourful festivals they have only seen on TV. Traveling, after all, is the best way to learn and discover new things.
Traveling benefits people in many ways. To start with, it is a good way for people to learn about the world. When they travel they get exposed to various cultures. They get to learn new languages and interact with new and interesting people. This exposure makes them tolerant and enhances their world view. Take myself as an example. I have been in France for a year as an exchange student. During this period, I have learned a great deal about the French culture. For instance, I have visited lots of museums and galleries in Paris and as a result, I now appreciate beauty in a more sensitive way. In addition, I have become more appreciative of differences. I now understand that customs, traditions, languages and skin colour are all unique to a country and need to be respected. In short, my travels have made me a better and more tolerant person. Every traveler has similar stories to share.
To conclude, more and more people are traveling because of their natural curiosity and also because they can afford it. In my opinion, this is a positive development because it promotes learning and understanding.",9,today-more-people-are-traveling-than-before-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
57,"Some people say it is important to keep your home and your workplace tidy, with everything organised and in the correct place.What is your opinion about this?","According to some people, organizing things and keeping them in their right place both at home and in office is important. I agree with this opinion to a certain extent, but I also feel that there is no need to keep something that is used often in the correct place.
On the one hand, keeping our home and workplace neat and tidy will make us feel comfortable, because messy surroundings distress and distract people. Moreover, if things are not kept in their right place, we will have to waste a lot of time looking for them. For example, many people can recount at least one occasion when they had to spend hours searching for their keys. Had they kept the keys in their right place, they could have saved a lot of time and trouble. Likewise, if important financial and health documents are not kept in the right place, the consequences can be disastrous. In the event of a medical emergency, no one can waste time looking for an important report or prescription. Obviously, there are several benefits to keeping things organized.
On the other hand, not everything has to be kept inits right place at all times. Actually, when it comes to things we usefrequently, keeping them in a place where we can find them easily is moreimportant than keeping them in their proper place. For example, I enjoyreading. Once I have taken a book from my book shelf, I put it back only afterI have finished reading it. Until then I leave it on my table or in my bed. Ifind nothing wrong with this arrangement because as long as I can find the bookeasily, I do not care whether it is in its right place or not.
To conclude, I believe that it is important to keep most things organized and in the correct place, because organization makes it easy to find them. However, certain things that we use often do not have to be in their right place at all times.",9,some-people-say-that-it-is-important-to-keep-home-and-workplace-tidy-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
58,"A person’s worth nowadays seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions. Old-fashioned values, such as honor, kindness and trust, no longer seem important. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The rich and the famous command greater respect in the modern society. In fact, values such as kindness, generosity and honesty are becoming irrelevant. Therefore, I agree with the argument that worldly riches and social standing have become the new measures of a person’s worth. One of the reasons for this development is that the media encourages young people to follow the wrong role models. Also it has become difficult for ethical people to succeed in this immoral world.
Youngsters these days choose the wrong people as their idols. They are misguided by the notion that a person should be wealthy and famous to be successful. They read about models, singers and actors having millions of followers on social media and want to be like them. They do not care whether the person they admire has character or integrity. They are blinded by the hype surrounding these people. Since they are always gazing at the ‘stars’, they do not get an opportunity to learn from the real heroes. Not surprisingly, a study conducted by a well-known university in 2016 revealed that 75% of girls aged between 14 and 18 years would rather be like Khloe Kardashian than Madam Curie or Mother Teresa.
However, this does not mean that people with principles have gone extinct. They are still around but they cannot find their way to a position of power or success. More often than not we observe that the offices of power are held by rich and influential people who are morally corrupt. Youngsters who follow them on social media and elsewhere get the impression that the honest cannot succeed in this world. Consequently, they give up on their ideology and choose to tread the easy path that would take them to success.
In conclusion, values have certainly become irrelevant in the twenty-first century. This could be due to various factors such as the influence of the media which constantly raves about the rich and the famous. Another factor that contributes to the demise of age-old values is the fact that honest and ethical people are struggling to succeed in this materialistic world.",9,a-persons-worth-nowadays-seems-to-be-judged-according-to-social-status-and-material-possessions-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
59,"Many working people get little or no exercise either during the working day or in their free time, and have health problems as a result.
Why do so many working people not get enough exercise? What can be done about this problem?","Nowadays, working people devote less and less time to exercise and as a result, they develop many health problems such as obesity and heart disease. This is mainly because most employees are busy with their work and get hardly any time for themselves. Addiction to television programmes and videos games also discourages them from getting physically active during their leisure time.
Everybody is busy these days. People are working so hard to fulfill their personal and professional commitments that they get hardly any time to relax or exercise. For example, now most employees work overtime to meet their deadlines. By the time they reach their home, it is already pretty late and they have neither time nor stamina to hit the gym. Even in countries where there is a five day work week people rarely exercise on the weekends. They either catch up on their sleep or sit in front of the computer or the television. Unfortunately, the sedentary lifestyle has a negative impact on their health.
Creating awareness about the risks of physical inactivity is the first step to counter this issue. The government should launch campaigns to encourage people to work out at least a couple of times a week. In addition, employers who require their employees to work overtime should be penalized. What’s more, companies should be encouraged to set up gyms and sports courts within their premises and employers should be allowed to access them during their recess. Studies have shown that even a simple stretch allows people to shake off their lethargy and enhance their productivity.
To conclude, the busy lifestyle is the main reason that prevents people from getting adequate exercise.

60,Popular events like the football world Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in the safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Major sports events like Olympics and World Cup Football Championship generate considerable interest all over the world. People all over the world watch them and support their teams with great fervour. Some people believe that such events are essential for easing tension between countries. I fully agree with this view.
Sports have always brought people together. The Greeks who started the Olympics used to even halt wars to take part in these events. Even today, wars and conflicts take a back seat when there is a major sporting event like World Cup or Olympics. That is because the soldiers who fight the wars also want to watch these games. Consequently a sense of calm prevails all over the world during such events.
Sporting events also give people a safe opportunity to express their patriotism. When people support their teams they forget their regional identities and think of themselves as one. For example, when there is a cricket match between India and Pakistan the whole of Indians come together to root for their team. People forget their regional identities and other differences and become one. For spectators, supporting their own team is also a great way to express their patriotism. When their team defeats the rival team in the World Cup, people experience the same exhilaration that they would experience if their country had won a war. However, unlike a war, sporting events do not lead to bloodshed. In other words, supporting one’s team in a sporting event is a safe and peaceful way to give vent to patriotic feelings.

61,"In some areas of the US, a curfew is imposed, in which teenagers are not allowed to be out of doors after a particular time at night unless they are accompanied by an adult.","In certain parts of the United States, teenagers cannot go out after a particular hour of the night without the supervision of an adult. In my opinion, this is justified because adolescents are too young to keep themselves safe and secure at all times.
Keeping teenagers confined to their homes during the late hours of the night is beneficial for them. If they go out alone during this time, they are more likely to come into contact with criminals and pedophiles. For example, the drug mafia target new ‘customers’ under the cover of darkness. If teenagers are out alone they are more likely to fall into such traps without realizing the consequences of their actions. They may start using drugs out of curiosity and eventually become addicts. Sexual predators also target children and teenagers who are alone at night. Young people cannot distinguish between good and bad relationships and may land themselves in trouble by befriending such people. Such situations will not arise if they spend the night.
On the other hand, if teenagers are accompanied by an adult, they are less likely to be approached by criminals. This protects them from many evils. Also, the parent or guardian who accompanies the children can keep a tab on their activities and warn them when they cross the limits.
In conclusion, this ‘curfew’ that prevents teens from going out of their home alone at late night is beneficial for them and protects them from crime and bad company. Since teenagers are too young to understand what is right or wrong, they need the care and protection of an adult when they are in vulnerable circumstances.",9,in-some-areas-of-the-us-teenagers-are-not-allowed-to-be-out-of-doors-after-a-particular-time-at-night-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
62,"Nowadays, international tourism is the biggest industry in the world. Unfortunately, international tourism creates tension rather than understanding between people from different cultures. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Over the years, tourism has grown into a huge industry. Actually, it is the backbone of many economies. For example, tourism is the main source of revenue for countries like Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Maldives. Some people, however, opine that tourism leads to tension between countries. While I agree with this statement to a certain extent, in my opinion this is not a problem that cannot be resolved.
Lack of understanding of cultures and traditions often leads to tension between tourists and locals. For example, most countries in the Middle East and South East Asia are conservative by nature. Middle Eastern countries in particular have strict codes of conduct and dressing. When tourists especially those from the liberal West visit these countries problems often arise. Locals expect the foreign visitors to follow their customs and traditions. Often times, the visitors simply do not care. There have even been many cases where the locals attacked tourists for disrespecting their culture. In the end, such unfortunate incidents lead to problems between the two countries. Hence, the argument that tourism leads to tension between countries certainly holds some water.
Even so, in my opinion, tourism also fosters understanding. Actually, this tension can be diffused by simply promoting a culture of understanding. Countries that receive a lot of international tourists should take the moral responsibility to teach their citizens about cultural differences. Locals should be taught that they cannot expect a foreigner to behave like them or to respect their customs as they do. At the same time, countries that send a lot of tourists to other countries should also sensitize their people about the importance of respecting the culture and traditions of the country they visit. These simple measures will solve most of the problems associated with tourism.
To conclude, tourism may create tension between countries when there is a lack of understanding about culture and traditions. However, nations can combat this issue by inculcating an attitude of tolerance and understanding in their citizens.",9,international-tourism-creates-tension-rather-than-understanding-between-people-from-different-cultures-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
63,"Some people believe that children should not be given homework every day, while others believe that they must get homework every day in order to be successful at school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Whether or not children should receive homework every day is a matter of debate. Many parents and teachers insist that students should be given some tasks that they should complete at home because it enables them to internalize the concepts they learned at school. However, others completely oppose this view and claim that homework puts students under pressure. Both views will be discussed in this essay before arriving at a conclusion.
Homework certainly benefits students in many ways. Most students will not learn anything unless it is compulsory. By giving them homework every day, teachers can ensure that they learn their lessons on the same day they are taught in the class. In my opinion, this is the biggest benefit of giving homework. Without constant practice it is not possible to succeed at school. For example, subjects like science and mathematics need regular revision. If students do not do homework, they will suffer during exams because of the piling up of work.
On the flip side, giving too much homework can be counterproductive. If students go home with dozens of tasks after spending seven or eight hours at school, the consequences could be quite catastrophic. The human brain, especially the brain of young children, requires rest to perform efficiently. Otherwise, it could malfunction and children might develop depression.
In my opinion, the concept of homework itself is not harmful. Problems arise when teachers give too much homework and when students fail to use their time wisely. For instance, if the deadline for a specific assignment is after 2 weeks, most students would leave it until the very last minute and by doing this they are putting themselves under unwanted pressure. Parents can prevent such situations by regularly monitoring the homework of their children.
In a nutshell, some amount of homework is definitely beneficial for the academic success of students. However, teachers need to ensure that they are not burdening students with excessive work.",9,some-people-believe-that-children-should-not-be-given-homework-every-day-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
64,In many countries it is common for families to own and run their own business. Some people think this is the best way to run a business while others consider this a potential source of problems.,"Family owned businesses are quite common in some countries. While some people believe that they have higher chances of success others opine that they are more likely to run into trouble. In my opinion, family businesses have some inherent advantages. However, disagreements between family members can lead to the disintegration of such entities.
The biggest advantage that family businesses have over other businesses is that in a family owned business, people are working for themselves. This itself is a great factor that contributes to the success of a business. People tend to work harder when they work for themselves. Also when someone works for a family owned business, they have the support and encouragement of their family members. In addition, children born in business families learn the tricks of the trade from their childhood itself from their parents and grandparents. This exposure gives them a head start when they start their career and enables them to run the business more efficiently. Also working with family members for the common benefit of the whole family can be both fun and rewarding. In short, a family owned business has many advantages that a regular establishment lacks.
On the flip side, some of the advantages of a family run business can turn out to be disadvantages if the members of the family are not careful. For example, younger family members are more likely to be irresponsible and immature. If they regularly turn up late for work or take too many holidays, it can lead to disagreements. Also, when someone works under their father or sibling, they are more likely to show a lack of seriousness. Unfortunately, this will hurt the prospect of the entire business. In addition, disputes between family members and ego clashes will run a family owned business into trouble.
To conclude, after analysing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that family owned businesses have several advantages over other types of establishments. However, families that run their own business must ensure that disagreements between family members are resolved before they turn into a business crisis.",9,in-many-countries-it-is-common-for-families-to-run-their-own-business-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
65,"Today, more and more people choose to live by themselves. What are the causes of this? Is this a positive or negative development?","More and more people are living alone these days. There are several reasons behind this trend and the most important among them are the need for freedom and the financial security that many people enjoy these days. In my opinion, living alone has both advantages and disadvantages.
They are various reasons why many people prefer to live by themselves. To start with, they seek freedom and absolute control over their lives. They do not like it when their parents or siblings try to encroach on their personal space so they choose to live alone. Generation gap is another factor that contributes to this phenomenon. Oftentimes youngsters and their parents have widely different opinions on many things and this leads to conflicts. Living alone allows people to live as they wish. Another reason for this trend is the rapid economic development. Many people now earn more than enough to live on their own. Since they do not need the financial assistance of a parent or spouse, they choose to live by themselves. The advent of modern technologies like the internet and smart phone has also contributed to this trend. People are now ready to migrate to faraway lands because they are aware that they can stay connected to their near and dear ones from any part of the globe.
On the one hand, this development can be advantageous for young people. When they live alone, they have to learn to cook, wash and manage their finances independently. If they live with their parents, they receive help all the time and this may prevent them from acquiring important life skills and becoming independent.
On the other hand, living alone does not benefit the nurturing of family bonds. While it is true that we can now get in touch with our family from any part of the world, online interactions lack the warmth of real face to face interactions. Also, when youngsters choose to live on their own, their aging parents are left alone. Last but not least, too much freedom can be detrimental and it is quite possible for young people living alone to get into bad company. Thus, it is evident that this trend has a negative impact on family relationships in the long term.
In conclusion, although living alone has become a popular trend and has its inherent advantages, people still need to pay attention to its disadvantages in order to sustain family bonds.",9,today-more-and-more-people-choose-to-live-by-themselves-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
66,"Some people say that parents have the most significant influence in a child’s development. However, others say that things like television or friends have the most important influence on them. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","According to some people, parents are the most influential people in a child’s life; others insist that friends and gadgets like television have a greater impact on them. In my opinion, parents are certainly important in a child’s life but now friends and media are becoming even more influential.
Parents are important. After all, they are the first teacher and the role model of a child. Children learn much of the social skills from their parents. In fact, the atmosphere at home plays a crucial role in shaping their character and personality. That also explains why kids born to successful parents also become successful in their life. Likewise, kids coming from dysfunctional families are more likely to have personality problems.
Even so, in this age of information explosion parents are becoming less influential. To start with, most parents are now busy and get to spend only a small amount of time with their children. Now, the television has assumed the role of the baby sitter. Children spend enormous amounts of time in front of the TV and get influenced by the programmes on it. Consequently, their understanding of the world is now shaped more by the programmes they watch on television than by their parents.
Friends are even more influential than gadgets. Children spend a great deal of time with their peers at school and outside of it. It is quite natural for them to get influenced by their friends. Every child wants to be popular among their friends. Actually, many children are willing to even disobey their parents to impress their friends.
To conclude, parents are slowing losing their influence on children because they do not manage to spend adequate time with them. Not surprisingly, friends and gadgets are replacing parents as the greatest influence on children.",9,some-people-say-parents-have-the-most-significant-influence-in-a-childs-development
67,Many people think it is important to spend a lot of money on a large wedding celebration.  Others disagree. Discuss both these views and give your opinion and give reason for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge and experience.,"According to some people spending a lot of money on marriage parties is a must. Others insist that lavish celebrations are a waste of money and resources. Both views will be discussed in this essay; however, in my opinion, it does not make much sense to spend a lot of money on celebrations.
Celebrations make our lives more interesting. Also, lavish parties are an opportunity to show off our wealth. Actually, this is the reason many people choose to spend inordinate amounts of money on weddings. They believe that throwing a lavish wedding party will easily elevate their social standing. My uncle, for example, makes it a point to celebrate the weddings of his children in a lavish manner. He believes that those parties will earn him the respect of his friends and acquaintances.
On the other hand, there is a downside to throwing large wedding parties. Oftentimes families borrow money to celebrate the wedding of their son or daughter in a grand style. They may have seen their neighbour hold an expensive party on the occasion of his daughter’s marriage. Now, they feel compelled to have an even bigger party. This is not exactly a problem if they can afford it but that is not always the case. Many families fall into the debt trap in their desperation to hold a grand wedding that their friends will remember for good. Also, large parties often lead to the wastage of enormous amounts of foods and beverages.
Personally, I believe that instead of throwing ridiculously expensive parties, people should organize more intimate and simpler celebrations. Wedding celebrations are an opportunity to share our joy with our friends and relatives and small parties serve the purpose very well. Actually, spending large amounts on parties is a sign of vanity. And if this money is borrowed it is nothing but stupidity. Instead, people who truly want an unforgettable wedding should donate a sum of money to the disadvantaged sections of the society on this occasion. This way they can ensure that their celebrations bring joy to a lot of people who need it desperately.
To conclude, wedding celebrations are important because in most people’s lives they occur only once; however, it is foolish to spend astronomical amounts of money on these celebrations. Instead, people who have excess money should consider donating some to the poor and the needy.",9,many-people-think-it-is-important-to-spend-a-lot-of-money-on-a-large-wedding-reception-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
68,Some people consider price as the most important thing to consider when buying a product such as a cell phone and services like medical treatment. Do you agree or disagree?,"Price is the first thing that many people consider when purchasing a product or service. While I do admit that it is essential to spend our money wisely, I believe that money should not always be the chief consideration.
Price ought to be considered because it is indeed necessary to control our spending to avoid falling into the debt trap. In other words, before buying a product or service, we should identify whether it is a necessity or something optional. Even if it is a necessity, we should look at the price tag before placing the order. Sometimes it is possible that two products serving the exact same purpose are sold at different price tags. For example, a Samsung phone serves more or less the same purpose as an iPhone; yet there are countless people who spend inordinate amounts of money on the latter just because they are fascinated by that brand name. Such spending is never recommended, especially since it will land the buyer in serious debt. Therefore, however tempting it may look a consumer must not buy a luxury item on credit.
By contrast, there are situations when price tags must be ignored completely. Health and medical related services and expenses fall into this category. The amount of money spent should never be a priority in these circumstances, as any delay in availing of the service may lead to a life-threatening situation. Furthermore, in the event that the required amount is more than what the patient could afford, they should still proceed by borrowing money from a friend or obtaining a loan. However, such situations are rare and in most cases price ought to be considered so that excessive spending is budgeted and debt is avoided.
In conclusion, people should be careful about spending large sums of money on goods and services, unless it is a matter of life and death.",9,some-people-consider-price-as-the-most-important-thing-when-buying-a-product-or-service-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
69,One of the prime times for advertising on TV is when children get back from school. Some people think that advertisements aimed at children should not be allowed. What is your opinion?,"Advertisements play a major role in influencing the buying decisions of customers. Over the years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of ads targeting children because advertisers are aware that kids are the centre of nuclear families. Most of these ads are aired in the evenings when children are back from school and sitting in front of the television. Some people opine that commercials targeting young kids should be banned. I agree with this view to a great extent because in my opinion excessively promotional ads have a devastating effect on children.
First of all, children are easily manipulated by the adverts which take them to the virtual world and coax them to purchase products that are not always worth their money. For instance, toys of the Star Wars series are very popular among teenagers and sales of these toys are very high in the market. Secondly, the advertisements are delivered in such a way that children start pestering their parents to buy those products. The fast food chain McDonald’s employs this strategy. Their ads attract more and more teenagers to eat fast food which is not good for health because it contains high levels of fats and cholesterol which cause obesity and diabetes in children.
Another reason to restrict ads is that they may even put the lives of children at risk. Children often imitate the dangerous stunts performed by celebrities in commercials and often lose their life or cause themselves serious injuries because they are not aware of the consequences.
On the other hand, not all ads are bad. Actually, some of them promote good habits in children. For example, some ads encourage children to brush their teeth twice a day and wash their hands frequently. Such ads develop healthy habits in children and hence they should be aired during prime time.
To summarize, most ads targeting children are overly promotional and have a negative impact on children. Hence the government must ensure that they are not aired during prime time. However, ads promoting good habits and social commitment must be shown in the evenings when most children are in front of the television.",9,ads-targeting-children-should-not-be-allowed-during-prime-time-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
70,Teachers are more responsible for the social and intellectual development of students than parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"According to some people, teachers play a greater role than parents in the social and academic development of children. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, parents and teachers are equally responsible for the progress and success of children.
Teachers certainly play an important role in the development of children because students spend a great deal of time at school. Teachers not only teach; they also act as the guardians of their students. In addition to teaching alphabets and numerals, they impart crucial social education. For example, teachers teach students how to get along with others. They teach them to cooperate and compete with one another without hurting them. Since the school is a microcosm of the world, it is the best place to learn social skills and teachers make this easier by guiding children every step of the way.
The role of parents is equally, if not more, important. Parents are the first people that the child comes into contact with. Actually, studies have shown that much of the brain development occurs before the age of three.  Teachers play little or no role during this period. Also, no one loves the children like their parents do. Teachers are guiding lights and protect children from bullying and other vices at school, but the affection that they get from their parents is the ultimate security they need. Also, children are more likely to imitate their parents than their teachers. Actually, by simply being a role model for their children, parents can shape their character and career to a great extent. Parents also play a role in ensuring that the atmosphere at home is conducive to learning. No matter how well the teacher teaches, if the home environment is not suitable for learning, the children will not progress.
To conclude, there is no denying the fact that teachers help with the social and intellectual development of children. However, the argument that they have a greater role than parents does not hold much water because parents are the first and most important influence on children.",9,teachers-are-more-responsible-than-parents-for-the-intellectual-and-social-development-of-children-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
71,Human activities have led negative effects on plant and animals all over the world. Some people think it is too late to do something about it. Others think there is still some time to take actions. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Plants and animals have already suffered a great deal of damage due to human activities. Some people think that nothing can be done to undo the damage we have already caused to the planet. However, I am still hopeful.
Since human population is increasing year after year, there is a need for more and more resources. Also, people are living longer. More space is now needed to accommodate them and to grow food for them. Hence, trees are cut down to build houses and to make furniture. Forests are cleared for growing crops and these activities lead to the loss of habitat for birds and animals. Many species of birds and animals have already become extinct. Even so, I am hopeful that it is never too late to do something about this.
Actually, environmentalists all over the world have already started working together to mitigate this problem. They have begun to spread awareness among public. They have made people realize that deforestation not only leads to the loss of flora and fauna but causes climate change by increasing the amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere. People have sort of realized that humans cannot exist when other forms of life go extinct. Many countries have already passed laws that ban the killing of animals for their body parts or for fun.
For example, about a decade ago, humpback whales became almost extinct due to overfishing but after environmental enthusiasts launched vigorous conservation programmes their number has bounced back. Thus it is evident that with active participation of everybody concerned we can solve this pressing issue in a short period of time.
To conclude, while it is true that we have already caused considerable damage to other forms of life, it is still possible to reverse some of the changes and save the planet.

72,"Nowadays there are many medical surveys of treatments to reduce health problems. Who should conduct them, governments, individuals or private companies, in your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.","Medical surveys are often conducted to make an assessment of the health problems that affect a particular community or demographic. In my opinion, such surveys can be conducted by both the government and private companies; however, individuals should not be allowed to conduct them.
It is good for the public when the government sponsors such surveys. When medical surveys are conducted by the government, the findings will be unbiased. Also, the recommended treatment options will be more effective and affordable. Unlike private companies, governments are not focused on making a profit. Consequently, the findings of their surveys are more likely to benefit the general public. For these reasons medical surveys on serious health problems / ailments such as cancer or mental health disorder should only be conducted by the government.
Private companies, on the other hand, are profit-driven. They need to promote their products so they may tamper with the results.  Therefore, we cannot fully trust these companies. For example, when a toothpaste company conducts a survey, the finding will invariably highlight the goodness of their product. Therefore, private companies can perhaps be allowed to conduct surveys in the cosmetic field where it is not a question of life and death. Also, customers who want to enhance their appearance will probably not mind having to pay more. But allowing them to conduct surveys on serious health problems can have disastrous consequences.
As for individuals, well, they are not eligible for conducting health surveys. Since they lack the funds, infrastructure and resources to conduct authentic surveys, they should not be allowed to conduct them.
To conclude, since health surveys play a crucial role in helping a community stay healthy, they should be promoted. However, surveys on serious health problems should only by conducted by government agencies because surveys conducted by private companies are more likely to be biased.",9,who-should-conduct-medical-surveys-governments-private-companies-or-individuals-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
73,"It is said that “Not everything that is learned is contained in books”. Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?","Books have always been a source of knowledge, but they are not the best source. Nor are they the only source. In my opinion, we learn more from our experiences than from books. Also, knowledge gained from experience is more important and valuable than bookish knowledge.
No doubt, books teach us a lot of things. That is the reason they are used extensively in education. Books contain the knowledge and wisdom of learned people. They become a part of our life as soon as we start school, and sometimes even before that. While much of the knowledge contained in books is concerned with facts and theory, it is, nonetheless, useful and valuable. That explains why well-read people are more intelligent and knowledgeable than those who do not read much.
Even so, books are not the best source of knowledge. Actually, we learn a lot more from our experiences and that learning is even more useful. Book knowledge may enable us to get a good job and earn a living, but that alone is not sufficient to go through life. No book can teach us how to deal with each and every situation that we encounter in our life. Nor can it predict the outcome of our actions. No book can teach us how to be happy or content in life. Such knowledge can only be gained from our experience. That explains why experienced people are more knowledgeable and successful than people who only read books. In the workplace, too, people who have experience are given preference to those who only have a degree.
To conclude, knowledge gained from experience is more important than knowledge gained from books because there is more to life than facts and figures.

74,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree?,"According to some people, the number of boys and girls admitted to any course should be the same. In other words half of the seats should be reserved for male candidates and half should be reserved for female candidates. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, merit, and not gender, should be the criterion for admission into university programmes.
The argument that the number of boys and girls in each course should be the same is illogical in every aspect. To start with, it shows utter disregard for merit. If seats are reserved on the basis of gender, many meritorious students will fail to get admission. Also, while this move might seem to be an attempt to empower women by increasing their participation in university courses, that really is not the case. Almost every university in the world already admits both boys and girls. In order to secure admission to a university programme of her choice, a girl only has to get good grades. If she waits for reservation to gain admission, it is akin to admitting that her skills are not on par with those of male students.
Another argument against reserving seats on the basis of gender is the difference in the aptitude of men and women. Certain courses like nursing, home science or teaching are more popular among the girls. Likewise, certain courses like engineering and mechanics are more popular among boys. If half of the seats are reserved for boys in a nursing course, chances are many seats will lie vacant. At the same time, many meritorious girls will fail to get admission. Even in courses where both boys and girls have the same aptitude, this arrangement will prevent many deserving candidates from gaining admission just because they belong to the other gender.
To conclude, after analysing various scenarios that might arise from the implementation of this decision, it is not hard to see that reserving university seats on the basis of gender is unwise. It may dilute the quality of education by letting undeserving students in and preventing deserving students from securing admission.",9,universities-should-accept-equal-number-of-male-and-female-students-in-each-subject-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
75,"Living in a country where you have to speak a foreign language can cause serious social problems, as well as practical problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Every country has its own language. This arrangement can cause some difficulties to a person who moves to a foreign country and has to speak a foreign language. While I do admit that this can be quite challenging in the first few weeks, in my opinion, most people will overcome the language barrier fairly quickly.
There is no doubt that language is the first problem that an immigrant faces in the foreign land. Not being able to speak the native language can affect their ability to socialise and make friends. It can also affect their work efficiency because they are not able to give or take instructions. Going shopping, getting medical help or asking for directions can be equally challenging for someone who does not speak or understand the native language. However, in my opinion, none of these difficulties cause any serious issues because any language can be learnt with a little effort.
One thing that makes life easier for immigrants is the universal acceptance of English. More than 70% of the world population has at least a working knowledge of English. This knowledge is more than enough to survive the first few weeks in a foreign country. Even in countries like Russia, Japan or China where English is not spoken widely, it is still possible to find people who can read, write and speak it reasonably well.
Also, in order to learn a new language we only have to get exposed to it. If we hear a new language regularly or all the time, our brain will automatically pick it up. For this reason, learning a foreign language in a foreign country is actually easier than learning it while we are still in our country. Also, people who are interested in moving abroad can do themselves a favour and learn at least the basics of the foreign language because packing their bags.
To conclude, many people believe that having to converse in a foreign language can cause problems for immigrants; however, in my opinion, this is not a big issue because with a little effort most people can learn the foreign language and adapt to the new environment within a few weeks.",9,having-to-speak-a-foreign-language-can-cause-serious-problems-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
76,Some people think that cooking is an important skill for young people to learn. Others believe that it is better for people to learn how to cook after they become adults. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"Cooking is a skill that every human being has to master because our survival depends on food. Some people argue that children should learn cooking. Others insist that they can wait until they become adults. In my opinion, cooking can be learned at any age but very young children especially those below the age of twelve should not be allowed or encouraged to cook because they may harm themselves.
Cooking requires a person to handle sharp objects like knives. Since very young children lack the expertise to handle these objects, they are more likely to cause themselves some injuries if they engage in cooking. Operating a gas stove or an electric heater can be even more dangerous for young people. For this reason, very young children should not be allowed to cook. However, there is no harm when a comparatively older child tries their skills in the kitchen. Actually, teen boys and girls should be encouraged to learn at least the basics of cooking because this skill will be of great use to them when their parents are away. What’s more, teens get plenty of leisure time. This enables them to learn cooking under the supervision of their parents.
By contrast, when people enter their adulthood it becomes imperative for them to cook. If they have not already mastered this skill, they will find themselves in serious trouble. For example, many adults live away from their parents or family. If they already know cooking, moving away from family will not be much of a problem for them. But if they know nothing of cooking the first few days or weeks of their life in the new place will be quite stressful and they will have to rely on restaurant food. Whether or not this is a viable option depends on their financial status because restaurant food is not cheap. While it is perfectly possible to learn cooking after a person becomes an adult, the truth is that no one can become an expert cook in a day or two. Also, adults have a lot of other responsibilities as well. They may have young children to take care of and a busy job. As a result, many of them will have a tough time finding time to learn cooking.
To conclude, one does not have to wait to enter adulthood to learn cooking. Learning it during adolescence is actually easier because teenagers live with their parents and hence they can easily learn this important life skill from their adults. Also, they have plenty of free time.",9,it-is-better-to-learn-cooking-after-people-become-adults-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
77,"Some people think that having a set retirement age for everybody, regardless of occupation, is unfair. They believe that certain workers deserve to retire and receive a pension at an earlier age. Do you agree or disagree? Which types of workers do you think should benefit from early retirement?","People often debate what the appropriate retirement age is. According to some, having a standard retirement age for all professionals is not fair. I agree with this view. In my opinion, people working in industries that demand higher levels of endurance and agility should be given early retirement.
The idea of a standard retirement age for all professionals is certainly flawed. This is because different jobs have different requirements. For example, people working in military and police department need higher levels of physical fitness and mental agility. Since fitness levels decrease with age, they need early retirement. Pilots, drivers and motormen should also be given early retirement because of the demands of their job. They have to stay focused for hours on end. Since attention spans tend to decrease as people age, they cannot be allowed to work into their 60’s. Likewise, people working in the construction and mining sectors also need early retirement. These jobs pose a lot of health hazards and as such people performing them should be given early retirement.
On the other hand, there are certain jobs where experience matters more than anything else. For example, age is not a barrier for teaching. Because of this reason, teachers should be allowed to work as long as they want. Nurses and other health care providers should also be allowed to work if they can.
To conclude, a standard retirement age for all workers is not a wise idea and people working in industries that demand higher levels of physical and mental fitness should be given early retirement. In my opinion, before setting the retirement age for various industries, authorities should consider the specific nature of the job and the hazards posed by it.",9,having-a-set-retirement-age-for-all-is-not-fair

Others insist that spending money on existing transport networks is more important. While I do admit that existing roads and rail networks should be improved, in my opinion, it is equally important to invest in superfast trains.
No doubt existing public transport systems need to be improved. After all, they are the lifeline of a country. They connect every nook and corner of the country and facilitate the transport of goods and people. The best thing about public transport is that it is affordable and accessible. Also, by improving the frequency and reliability of buses and trains, the government can discourage the use of private vehicles. This will reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.
However, improving the existing roads and railway lines alone will not help. It is important to embrace new technologies as they arrive. Super fast trains are one of them. They significantly reduce the travel time between places. This is important in a vast country like India or China. For example, traveling from Kashmir to Kanyakumari on a bus or a train takes 4 or 5 days now. If there are superfast trains, this travel time can be reduced significantly. This will give a big boost to trade and tourism. Of course, these trains will require a large initial investment, but the return on investment will also be pretty high and hence it is justified.
To conclude, superfast trains are the need of the hour and hence I fully support spending money on them; having said that, it is equally important to improve existing public transport because an efficient network of roads and trains is the backbone of any economy.",9,government-should-improve-existing-public-transport-instead-of-investing-in-super-fast-trains
79,Some people think that children would benefit if they attend nursery school before primary school while some people think that children should stay all day with their families. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"According to some people, young children will benefit if their parents enroll them in a play school before primary school. Others insist that they should spend more time with their parents during their formative years. In my opinion, there are more advantages than disadvantages to sending children to a nursery school.
There is no denying the fact that young children need the love and attention of their parents. This, however, does not mean that they should spend the whole day at home in the company of their parents and grandparents. Actually the years between 3 and 5 are crucial for the development of a child. This is a great time for them to get exposed to the world outside their home. A nursery school is the perfect place for this. Most nursery schools operate for only 3 or 4 hours a day. So even if a child attends a nursery school she will still have plenty of time to stay with her parents. In other words, the nursery school will have no real impact on her emotional wellbeing or bonding with her parents.
At the same time, children can learn a lot of real world skills from the nursery school. They get to play with several children of their age. This enhances their social and communication skills. Needless to say, children who attend a nursery school are more likely to be extroverts with a sociable nature. Children can also learn the alphabets and numerals at kindergarten. This knowledge will give them an edge over other kids who start school at 5 or 6.
Conversely, if young children spend all of their time at home without going to a nursery school, they will find it rather difficult to keep pace with their peers when they start primary school. They will take weeks or even months to get used to the new environment and by then their peers will be way ahead of them.
To recapitulate, there are many benefits to enrolling kids in a nursery school before primary school. Children learn a lot during the years between 3 and 5 and if they go to a nursery school, they will definitely have an edge over those who start school at 5 or 6.",9,children-will-benefit-from-attending-nursery-school-before-primary-school
80,"Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Achieving economic progress is the ultimate goal of most governments all over the world. Some people, however, insist that a nation has to develop in other areas as well. I agree with them. In my opinion, a nation has to achieve social, cultural and intellectual progress among others.
Economic prosperity is important but it cannot be the only yard stick of development. Take, for instance, the case of Arabian nations. Many of them are rich; yet these countries are notorious for denying basic human rights to their people. Citizens cannot raise their voice against the authorities. In some Middle Eastern countries people cannot even decide what they should wear. Everything is dictated to them. Needless to say, in spite of the economic prosperity that these countries have achieved, the quality of life is somewhat low.
There are also some countries that have chosen to progress at the expense of environment. China is a good example of this. Chinese economy is growing at a rapid pace, but the cost of this development is the rampant pollution. Air quality is particularly worse in cities like Beijing. Obviously, this kind of development will not benefit people because it puts their health at risk. Intellectual and cultural progress is equally important. A nation that excels in these aspects will enjoy tremendous goodwill and reputation even if it is not very affluent.
To conclude, economic development is just one of the measures of progress. In order to achieve overall development and improve the quality of living, a nation has to progress in other areas as well.",9,economic-progress-is-the-main-goal-of-many-governments-band-9-ielts-essay-sample

Other people believe that it is important for children to make decision about matters that affect them. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people insist that children should have the freedom to decide what they should eat, wear, read or watch. Others opine that if children have the freedom to make their own choices, they will grow up into selfish individuals. In my opinion, children should definitely have the freedom to make their own choices; however, parents should also teach them to respect the needs and wants of others.
It is important for children to make their own choices. This way they can learn to be independent and grow up into strong willed adults who achieve success. What’s more, a child who knows what he wants is more likely to be successful than one who has no clear goals or ambitions. Needless to say, children who take small decisions right from their childhood are better at dealing with challenges and conflicts.
However, there is an important downside to this. Children who make their own choices have increased chances of becoming selfish. For instance, my nephew always insists on watching his favourite programmes on television. He does not care whether the rest of the family likes those shows or not. He is only concerned about what he wants. In future, this attitude will impact his ability to work in a team. He may even fail in his relationships. In short, the lack of emotional intelligence is detrimental to the success and happiness of a child.
In conclusion, although it is important for children to learn to make choices regarding their day to day life, parents must ensure that they are also learning to respect the decisions and choices of others. Only then can they grow up into free-willed adults who also possess empathy.",9,children-should-be-allowed-to-make-their-own-choices-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
82,Nowadays we are producing more and more rubbish. Why do you think this is happening? What can governments do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced?,"Excessive production of waste is an issue we face today. In order to tackle this menace it is important to identify its cause.
Consumerism is the number one cause of the excessive production of garbage. Markets are getting flooded with cheap low quality products. They don’t last very long. People buy them, use them for a few weeks or months and then throw them away. Eventually these end up in landfills. Growing consumerism is also responsible for mindless shopping. People buy products they do not even need and once those products start collecting dust, they are also thrown away. Many of these products cannot even be recycled. Consequently, they lie in the landfills polluting the environment.
Excessive use of plastic also contributes to the growing production of rubbish. We go shopping empty handed and bring home the purchase in plastic carry bags. Food is often served on plastic plates during community celebrations and functions. Some even restaurants use plastic cutlery. E-waste is another problem that confronts us today. People no longer get a broken television or mobile phone repaired. Instead they buy a brand new piece. Some people discard their smart phones or laptops in working condition as soon as a new model hits the market. They are neither concerned nor aware of the impact of their actions on the environment.
In order to deal with the growing production of garbage, the government should enact some stringent laws. It should make recycling mandatory. It should also ban the use of plastic and impose heavy tax on consumer goods like mobile phones to reduce their sales. Another way the government can fight this menace is to create awareness among the public. If people realize that they are knowingly or unknowingly hurting the planet by throwing away stuff, they will definitely want to change their habits.
To conclude the ‘use and throw’ culture is the number one cause of excessive production of garbage. Measures such as making recycling mandatory and banning plastic will definitely help to deal with this menace.

Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","Knowledge is wealth and when it is shared its value multiplies. While some people support the free sharing of scientific, academic and business information, in my opinion, some information has to be safeguarded.
There are both benefits and drawbacks to sharing information freely. To begin with, information related to medical research can save lives. For example, the swine flu vaccine saved thousands of lives. If the researchers who developed this vaccine had not shared it with others, thousands of people would have perished. In the same way, information related to new technologies should also be shared because it has the power to improve the lives of people. Take, for instance, the case of the internet. It would not have become such a huge success if only a few countries had access to it. Today, the internet connects billions of people living across the world. It enables tens of thousands of small entrepreneurs to earn a living by selling their products or services to buyers all over the world. Needless to say, the sharing of information certainly has many benefits.
However, some information cannot be shared because it will endanger the lives of people. For example, information regarding the nuclear weapons or military of a country cannot be shared with others. If enemy countries gain access to that information, it can hurt the security of people living in that country.
To conclude, there are certainly many benefits to sharing useful information with others.

84,Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.,"Noise pollution disturbs the general population and hence some people insist that there should be strict regulations to control the amount of noise an individual can create. In my opinion, there are several advantages to enacting these kinds of laws; there are an equal number of disadvantages too.
Noise pollution has become a major issue in some of the cities around the world. If there are laws to reduce the noise levels, the public will benefit in many ways. Firstly, enacting strict laws to control the noise levels could improve the productivity of the general population because it enables them to get restful, undisturbed sleep which is important for their overall health and concentration levels. It goes without saying that blaring music at late night parties disturb the entire neighourhood and deprive them of the much needed sleep. If there are strict laws to control the menace, noise pollution will reduce dramatically.
On the flip side, enacting laws alone will not help. The government will have to form special squads to ensure that noise levels are within the permitted limits. Making do with the existing forces is not a viable solution because emergency police personnel cannot be summoned to stop a late night party just because it has exceeded the noise limits. Formation of such squads can be a burden on the exchequer and consequently, the government will have less money to spend on more serious issues like crime and violence. Another thing to consider is the impact of such laws on festivals and cultural celebrations. The truth is that festivals are a major cause of noise pollution. But taking measures like imposing a ban on noisy fire crackers or percussion instruments can make these occasions less lively and vibrant. This may have a negative impact on the culture.
In conclusion, it is important for the authorities to enact laws to control noise pollution. However, certain exceptions have to be made to ensure that celebrations are not marred.",9,there-should-be-strict-laws-to-control-noise-pollution-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
85,"In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem?","Despite the fact that farming methods and yield improved dramatically over the last century, millions of people still do not have enough food to eat. There are social, economical and climatic reasons behind this disturbing phenomenon.
Famine or food scarcity only affects the poor. Whether they grow their food or not, the rich will ensure that they have enough on their platter. The poor, unfortunately, lack this purchasing power. If food is not made available at concessional rates, they cannot have to access to it. Most of the time poor people do not own any land. Consequently, they cannot grow their own food. They have to buy their food and when food prices increase, they cannot have their fill.
The change in climate also causes famine. Extreme drought like conditions persist in some countries. For example, in some parts of Africa it has not rained in years. Consequently, people living in those regions cannot grow their crops. They are dependent on food grown in other areas and if that is not available, then these people will have to go hungry. Political reasons also contribute to this problem. Many countries refuse to share their water resources with other countries. Often times this is caused by the enmity between these nations. Unfortunately, this practice affects the food security in those countries that do not have adequate water resources of their own.
In order to solve this problem, the governments need to ensure that food is available for the poor for free or at concessional rates. Rich countries which grow surplus food should show the magnanimity to share their excess with poor countries that do not have enough food to feed their people. International organizations can play an important role in ensuring that nations share their wealth and resources with those that need it.
To conclude, hunger continues to haunt millions of people even in the 21st century. Often times this is caused by the inequitable distribution of wealth and resources. Rich countries and rich people can do a lot to ensure that the poor also have access to a basic necessity like food.

86,Some people think that air travel should be restricted because it can cause environment pollution. Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and relevant examples. Give reasons for your explanations and use any relevant examples from your own life.,"Since air travel causes environmental pollution some people insist that it should be restricted. However, I do not agree with this view because other modes of transportation also emit poisonous gases into the atmosphere and affect air quality. Hence by simply restricting air travel we cannot reduce pollution.
Air travel certainly causes air pollution; however, discouraging it is not the solution to this problem because any such move will have disastrous consequences on the economy. If air travel is restricted, it will have a massive impact on the travel and tourism industry. Since this sector employs tens of thousands of people, any decision that affects it will have a negative impact global economy. International tourism is the main source of revenue for many developing and developed countries in the world. If air travel is banned or restricted, it will mean that international tourists will have to depend on alternative means of transport. Since water transport is extremely slow many of them will simply give up their plan to visit foreign countries. Consequently, many people who depend on tourism will lose their living.
What’s more, air travel is not the only cause of pollution. Cars, buses and trucks cause as much pollution as aeroplanes. Therefore, by simply discouraging air travel, we cannot achieve any real improvement in air quality. A better solution is to invest in greener sources of fuels.
To conclude, the argument that air travel should be restricted because it causes air pollution does not hold much water for the simple reason that other means of transport also pollute the air. If improving air quality is our goal, investing in greener sources of energy is the solution.",9,air-travel-should-be-restricted-because-it-causes-pollution-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
87,International tourism is becoming a major industry. Some people think it causes more tension than the anticipated understanding between different countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Tourism has become a major industry over the last few decades. In fact, for some countries tourists are the biggest source of revenue. While it is generally believed that tourism, especially international tourism, promotes understanding among people of different cultures and beliefs some people argue that it creates more conflicts and tension. I do not quite agree with this. While I do admit that international tourism has some negative aspects to it, in my opinion, its disadvantages pale in comparison to its advantages.
The influx of tourists can certainly cause some problems in the host country. Tourists may damage the local environment by littering around. This can be a real problem in places that attract a large number of people. A few of them might even show disrespect to the local culture and thus create conflicts. However, such incidents are rare. Tourists generally abide by the local rules and customs even if they do not really respect them. Most of them understand the dangers involved in getting into conflicts with the local community. Therefore, the argument that tourism creates more tension does not hold much water.
On the flip side, tourism offers numerous benefits. It benefits travelers as well as their hosts. Tourists help the local economy thrive. During their visit they buy local handicrafts or produce and thus help the local artisans and farmers earn a living. In fact, nations that attract a large number of international tourists have generally higher standard of living because of the valuable foreign exchange they earn. Better still, tourism broadens the perspectives of people. People who travel are more tolerant of change and diversity. They understand that it is all right to speak a different language, have a different skin colour or belong to a different faith. Actually this understanding is what we need in this age where people fight over trivial issues like race, religion or skin colour.
To conclude, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that tourism does not cause tension. It might cause environmental problems in extremely popular tourist destinations but the chances of tourists creating conflicts are rather slim. After all, people travel to learn and discover. They will not fly thousands of miles if their only objective was to create conflict in another part of the world.",9,international-tourists-creates-more-conflicts-than-understanding-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
88,Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.,"There are multiple benefits to learning a foreign language. Of course, work and travel are definitely good reasons to learn a foreign language, but those are not the only the reasons to be bilingual or multilingual.
Learning a second or third language benefits the learner in so many ways. Studies have shown that bilingual or multilingual people are smarter than monolingual people. By simply learning a foreign language, we can increase our brain activity. This, in turn, will make us smarter and sharper. Studies have even shown that learning a foreign language can delay the onset of memory ailments like dementia.
Another advantage of learning a foreign language is that it allows us to learn more about the culture associated with that language. Language and culture are intrinsically linked. Actually, it is impossible to understand a foreign culture without learning their language first. By learning a foreign language, we also get to enjoy the literature and music in that language. Of course, translations are available but they will never beat the original. For example, the Russian language has numerous classical novels written in it. While these novels have been translated to many languages, one has to learn Russian to be able to read the original.
Also, in this age of the internet, people who are fluent in a foreign language can find work as translators or interpreters within their country itself. They do not necessarily have to go abroad to use their knowledge of international languages.
To conclude, considering all the points mentioned above it is not hard to see that travelling to a foreign country or working in a foreign country are not the only reasons to learn  a foreign language. Actually, there are many other equally compelling reasons to learn a second or third language and in this age of globalization people get plenty of opportunities to use their foreign language skills within their country itself.",9,the-only-reason-for-learning-a-foreign-language-is-to-travel-to-or-work-in-a-foreign-country-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
89,"Some people think that youngsters should get involved in unpaid work, while others oppose as it may affect their career. Discuss both the sides and give your opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include and relevant examples.","People have different opinions about whether youngsters should get involved in unpaid social work. While some insist that it is beneficial for young people, others argue that it will hurt their career prospects. In my opinion, it certainly makes sense for youngsters to engage in some kind of community work during their free time; however, they should not allow the volunteering to take their focus off their career goals.
Young people reap many benefits when they engage in unpaid work for the underprivileged sections of the society. This allows them to see the various aspects of life and when they realize that many people around them do not even have the basic necessities of life, they will learn to count their blessings. In addition, volunteering is a great opportunity to acquire valuable work experience. They can mention these stints in their resume when it is time to apply for a job. Youngsters who have done some kind of community work are more likely to get hired than someone who has absolutely no experience of volunteering. Better still, the satisfaction that they get from doing something for the betterment of the society is immense.
On the flip side, if a youngster gives too much importance to community work, he may lose his focus on his studies. This, in turn, will hurt his career prospects. In the highly competitive job market, it is impossible to find good job opportunities if you do not have a university degree with good grades. However, not doing unpaid work is not the solution to this problem. Rather, youngsters should have a clear idea of what they want to achieve in life. They should volunteer only during their free time.
In conclusion, doing unpaid community work allows young people to gain valuable work experience and better perspectives on life; however, they must ensure that the community work does not distract them from their career goals.

90,"Large businesses have big budgets for marketing and promotion and as a result, people gravitate towards buying their products. What problem does this cause? What could be done to encourage people to buy local products?","Thanks to globalisation, multinational conglomerates have entered the local markets. They have huge marketing budgets to promote their products and attract buyers. Unfortunately, the aggressive marketing strategies employed by big conglomerates lead to the demise of local shops. However, local store owners can counter this attack by improving the quality of their products and offering personalised services.
Global business giants now have their outlets even in small villages. Since they offer huge discounts on most products, they can easily attract buyers. At first glance, this may seem beneficial for the customers but it really is not. The presence of international retailers in the local market hurts local businesses and thus the local economy. For example, many local artisans have lost their livelihood because their products have no buyers. Instead of buying their handmade products, people now prefer to buy the factory made goods that look more attractive. If local people lose their livelihood, eventually the purchasing power of the local community will diminish.
The only way for local businesses to compete with international giants is to offer personalised services. While it is true that local traders cannot offer the kind of discounts or offers that multinational giants offer, they know their customers better. It is also possible for them to understand the exact needs of their target group. This knowledge actually puts them in a better position to cater to the specific needs of their buyers. In addition to this, the local businessmen should try to improve the quality of their products. This is essential to ensure that their customers will return. The government also needs to intervene and prevent multinational giants from entering certain sectors.
To conclude, when international companies woo local customers with great discounts and offers, the local economy suffers the most. However, local businessmen can overcome this threat by offering customized solutions to their buyers.

91,It is becoming increasingly popular to have a year off between finishing school and joining universities. What are the advantages or disadvantages?,"Of late, it has become increasingly popular among students to take a gap year after finishing high school. This practice enables them to relax and have fun with friends or family. During this period they can also travel or learn new things. However, in my opinion, taking a break after high school and before joining university does have some drawbacks.
The biggest advantage of taking a break is that students get an opportunity to relax and learn some valuable life lessons during this period. At high school students are under tremendous pressure to get high scores. Consequently, they have to study for prolonged hours, complete numerous assignments and spend many sleepless nights. For instance, a cousin of mine who took her high school public exam last year was always occupied with her studies, tuition and record work. She rarely went to bed before midnight. Furthermore, she stayed away from family events or parties for the whole year. Obviously, students take great pains to perform well in their exams and they deserve a break after high school. During this period they can travel or find a part time job that enables them to learn new skills that might help them in the future. Traveling or working part time will also give them an idea of what to expect when they have to travel for work or studies in the future.
On the flip side, taking a break from studies can have some negative effects. To start with, many students will simply waste this time doing nothing useful. Another disadvantage is that when students take a break, they may lose interest in studies. Actually, many of them will never go to university. In addition, because of this discontinuity students may forget many concepts they learned at school. Consequently, when they join university they will have to work doubly hard.
To conclude, taking a gap year after high school is only beneficial for those students who use that time to engage in something productive. Those who take this break to relax and have fun will have to work harder when they join university after a year.

Personally, I like change but I will discuss both views / both opinions in the following paragraphs.
People, who love stability in life, hesitate to change their jobs, routines or lifestyle. They create a comfort zone at their workplace and do not want to come out of it. Moreover, staying in the same job for a long time allows / enables them to gain expertise in that area / field / domain. They become source a source of knowledge and guidance for new comers. They also get to establish themselves as an authority in their field. However, this prevents them from learning new skills or identifying their hidden talents. What’s more, it is possible that after a while they will get tired of doing the same things again and again. This monotony will eventually lead to boredom and they may even lose interest in their job or routines.
Changing jobs and routines frequently, on the other hand, might seem daunting but it does not really have to be if one knows what one is doing. In this age of possibilities, coming out of one’s comfort zone is the only way to learn something new and explore new opportunities. While this might seem challenging, it will turn out to be a rewarding pursuit in the long run. For example, change gives a person exposure to various fields and opportunities to find a better job or better workplace. What’s more, while executives who are resistant to change will eventually get bogged down by the monotonous nature of their work, those who embrace change are insulated from this problem.
In conclusion, both sides of the argument have their merits; however, in my opinion, embracing change is essential to learn new things and realize our full potential.

If this prediction does come true, in my opinion, it will have both positive and negative ramifications.
No doubt, a universal language will benefit both people and businesses in numerous ways. It will make communication easier. As a result businesses can market their products all over the world. People can also travel to any part of the world without having to worry about getting lost because of the language barrier. This, in turn, will benefit industries such as travel and hospitality. Needless to say, a universal language will benefit almost all economies around the world. It may even foster respect and understanding among people of different ethnicities.
On the flip side, the prospect of having just one language for all does not bode well for the preservation of cultural identities. Culture is intrinsically linked to language. So if people adopt a global language and stop using their mother tongue it will not take long for their culture to die. The death of local languages will also make the folklore and literature in that language unavailable to future generations. In my opinion, this will be a huge loss to humanity. Another possible consequence will be the loss of employment for people working as translators and interpreters. In a world where everyone speaks the same language, they will be rendered jobless.
In conclusion, a universal language can be beneficial for businesses and people because it facilitates hassle free communication.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Industries provide employment but they also cause a great deal of pollution. Therefore, some people argue that the government should impose higher taxes on industries that cause more pollution. I do not quite agree with this view.
Imposing higher taxes on polluting industries certainly seems like a good idea; however, if this measure is implemented, it will create more problems down the lane. To start with, companies may assume that they have a right to pollute as long as they are ready to pay the tax. Consequently, they will have no motivation to invest in greener technologies. Needless to say, pollution levels will get considerably worse within a few years.
A better solution is to encourage companies to reduce the pollution they cause. The government can offer them incentives to invest in greener technologies. For example, the government should consider offering tax rebates to companies that reduce their pollution levels. This will encourage more and more companies to adopt eco-friendly technologies. The government must also make it mandatory for all businesses to comply with emission standards. It must ensure that industries have set up plants to treat their waste before allowing them to start their operations. The laws already exist in almost all countries but the problem is that they are rarely implemented. This is particularly true in the developing countries where corrupt officials collude with entrepreneurs and issue commencement certificates without checking whether adequate waste disposal systems are in place. Moving hazardous industries to uninhabited places may also help.
To conclude, imposing higher tax on companies that cause more pollution is unlikely to solve the problem. Worse, this measure may exacerbate the situation.

95,It is a good thing for people in senior management positions to get a higher salary than other workers in the same company. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Most organisations pay higher salaries to employees holding senior management positions. In my opinion this is justified because senior level employees tend to have more responsibilities. They also have more degrees and experience.
If companies pay higher salaries to senior executives, that is because these positions come with a lot of responsibilities. For example, the branch manager of a company is responsible for overseeing the operations of the entire branch whereas a junior level employee only has to take care of their respective job. A customer care executive is only responsible for answering the queries of customers. They are not held responsible if a product or service fails in the market. A production head, on the other hand, is answerable to the executives above him if a particular product fails. Obviously, senior level positions are highly demanding. What’s more, in order to be able to occupy such positions, an employee needs to have years of experience and degrees from top tier institutions. Therefore, in my opinion, the higher salaries that seniors command are justified.
The organisation also gets to retain their key people when they give higher remuneration to seniors. At the same time, the higher wages of managers and CEOs encourage junior level employees to work harder for promotions and raises. This, in turn, increases the productivity of the organisation.
On the other hand, if every employee receives the same salary regardless of their job profile no one will have the motivation to put in more hours or work hard. Needless to say, this will have a negative impact on the profitability of the organisation.

96,Developments in technology are causing environmental problems. Some think the solution is for people to adjust to a simpler life while others believe that technology itself can solve these problems. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is no denying the fact that technological development has had a negative impact on the planet. Everything from the air we breathe to the food we eat is contaminated these days due to the use and abuse of various inventions of technology. For example, motor vehicles pollute the air. Pesticides contaminate the food we eat. Some people believe that the only way to reverse environmental damage caused by technology is to adopt a simple lifestyle. Others insist that technology can undo the damage caused by it. I agree with this view.
To start with, the argument that we all should now live a simpler life devoid of technology is impractical. We are so habituated to having technology in our life that it is now impossible to imagine a world without light bulbs, fans, refrigerators or computers. So, even if technology is causing considerable environmental damage it is impossible to convince people that they should stop using it.
A better solution is to invest in greener technologies that can mitigate much of the environmental damage already done. Scientists have already started working on them. For example, many trains now run on electricity. They cause much less pollution than diesel engines. Electric cars are another promising technology. It is safe to assume that in 10 or 15 years, they will completely replace cars running on fossil fuels. Likewise, greener energy sources like wind and solar may soon replace conventional energy sources like coal.
To conclude, while it is true that technology caused a great deal of damage to the environment, it is also quite capable of finding solutions to the problems it caused. As technology continues to develop, I am sure it will become cleaner and greener. Thus the argument that adopting a simple life is the only way to mitigate environmental damage does not hold much water.",9,developments-in-technology-are-causing-environmental-problems-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
97,"Money for postgraduate research is limited. Some people, therefore, think that financial support from government should be only provided for scientific research rather than research for less useful subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the opinion?","The government cannot fund all research projects because its budget is limited; therefore, some people insist that only research pertaining to the field of science and technology should receive government funding. While I do admit that scientific research should receive maximum funding, I totally disagree with the argument that the government should stop funding research in less ‘useful’ fields like arts or history.
Scientific research certainly provides tremendous value because scientific innovations have the power to change our lives for good. Take, for instance, the invention of the antibiotic. This wonder drug saved the lives of millions of people and continues to be a major lifesaver even today. The computer is also the result of scientific research. This invention changed the way we work and store information. Today, it is impossible to imagine a world without computers. Other inventions like electricity, motor vehicles and home appliances have also revolutionized our lives.
However, just because scientific research provides more value it does not mean that research in other ‘less useful’ fields should be discouraged. Of course, archeological research or research into the origin of languages is unlikely to have a massive impact on our day-to-day life. Yet, this information is crucial for understanding how we reached where we are today. The truth is that there are still a lot of things we can learn from previous generations. These kinds of research may even lead us to a common ancestor and that might put an end to the hostility prevailing between many nations. Historical research also teaches us about mistakes we must not repeat. The World Wars and the Genocide are two examples. Research on these horrific incidents keeps reminding us about the extent of damage they caused. If future generations do not learn about them, they might be tempted to commit the same mistakes again.
To conclude, not only scientific research but research in other fields also provides great value. Therefore, the argument that only scientific research should receive government funding does not hold water.",9,money-for-postgraduate-research-is-limited-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
98,Developed countries should take more refugees from poorer countries. Do you agree or disagree?,"Each year millions of people get displaced due to wars, epidemics and natural calamities. They cannot continue to live in their country; therefore some people argue that developed countries where conditions are stable must accept more refugees. I totally agree with this view.
Developed countries have stable economies and infrastructure that can accommodate many more people. To start with, many of these countries have a low population. They can comfortably accommodate any number of poor refugees. What’s more, refugees are not known to create any problems in their adoptive country.
Secondly, oftentimes developed countries are responsible for many of the problems affecting developing countries. For example, America has been at war with many countries in Asia. These wars destroyed the homes and livelihood of millions of people. A good example of this is Vietnam. More than 40 years ago, it was the battlefield of the US, China and Russia. Today Vietnam is one of the poorest countries in the world. Countries like Iraq and Syria have also borne the brunt of wars. Since developing countries are responsible for initiating many of these wars and conflicts they have a moral obligation to take care of the displaced people.
There is yet another reason for developed countries to accept more refugees. Contrary to what many people believe, the problem of refugees is not confined to any particular region. Every human being needs food and shelter. If the basic needs of people are not satisfied they may get into crime. In other words, if refugees remain refugees for life, they are more likely to create problems in other parts of the world. Thus it is evident that by accepting more refugees developed nations can make the world a more peaceful place to live in.
To conclude, the entire world has the responsibility to rehabilitate refugees. Since developed countries have the means to support them, in my opinion, they should accept more refugees.",9,developed-countries-should-take-more-refugees-from-poorer-countries-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
99,Learning to play team sports is an important part of a child’s education. Do you agree or disagree? Give reason for your answer. And include any relevant experience from your own knowledge.,"The objective of education is to ensure the all round development of children. Since team sports improve their physical fitness, team spirit and communication and social skills, I agree with the argument that they should be a part of a child’s education.
When children play a team sport, they learn many valuable skills that will stand them in good stead. For example, they learn to work with a common objective. They learn to share and put the interests of the group above theirs. For example, in a game of football not everybody can score a goal. Most teams will typically have only two or three strikers but the entire team has to work with one objective to help those strikers score the goals that win the match. Thus when children play a game like football they learn that everybody has to work together to achieve common goals. Needless to say, kids who grow up playing team sports will be excellent team players at the workplace. This quality is particularly important in this age where winning is all about collaborating. In addition, team players are also less likely to be self-centered.
Another advantage of playing a sport is that it enables children to accept success and defeat gracefully. If sports are part of education, all children will get an opportunity to play. Otherwise, they may only focus on academics and thus fail to enjoy the benefits of team sports.
To conclude, considering all the above points, it is not hard to see that children who play a team game are much more likely to enjoy better physical and emotional well-being than children who do not play any team sports. Hence I fully agree with the argument that team sports should be a part of education.",9,learning-to-play-team-sports-is-an-important-part-of-a-childs-education-band-9-ielts-essay
100,People say that a child’s success is dependent on the way parents bring them up. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"Parents are the biggest influence on their children during their formative years and for this reason some people argue that the upbringing that a child receives determines their success in the future. I fully agree with this view.
A child is like a piece of clay. It can be molded into whatever shape. If parents inculcate good values in their children, it is nearly impossible for them to go astray when they grow up. Likewise, if parents encourage them to work hard and dream big, they will most probably achieve great things in future. If we study the lives of highly successful people, it is not hard to see that they all had been highly influenced by their parents or a parent figure. For example, parents were a great influence on Mohandas Gandhi. Nehru had a tremendous influence on his daughter Indira. In his autobiography APJ Abdul Kalam also narrated how the simple and hardworking nature of his parents had shaped his personality.
By contrast, children raised by parents who have no moral values often get into antisocial activities as they grow up. That explains why children coming from a criminal background almost always end up being criminals. They had no one to show them the right path during their childhood and consequently they chose the path of their parents. Children neglected or abused by their parents are also more likely to get into crime.
Every child needs love and care. They need someone to hold their hand and motivate them. They need someone to show them what is right and wrong. Otherwise, they will wilt before they can bloom.
On balance, it is not hard to see that parents play a crucial role in shaping up the future and personality of their children. They are the first and foremost influence on their children and as such it is their responsibility to ensure that they are guiding them in the right path.",9,people-say-that-a-childs-success-is-dependent-on-the-way-parents-bring-them-up-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
101,"Some people think that in order to solve traffic and transportation problems, people should be encouraged to live in cities rather than in suburbs or in the countryside. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Traffic congestion has become a major problem in almost all countries. Some people argue that the easiest way to solve this problem is to encourage all people to move to cities. Of course, people living in cities have easy access to all amenities and they do not have to travel much; however, I strongly disagree with the argument that everyone should move to cities. Any such move will only compound the problems.
Most cities in the world are already struggling to accommodate their existing population. For example, in India, cities like Mumbai and Bangalore are already pretty crowded. If everyone in the surrounding areas moved to these cities, they will become super crowded. Consequently the quality of living will suffer.
While it is true that cities offer jobs and have all amenities within an area of a few kilometers, space constraints are a big issue in all cities. There is a limit to the number of people that a city can house. As population increases the need for housing and other amenities will increase. Since space is already scarce it is impossible to build homes for all the people who migrate to cities. When demand exceeds supply, the price will increase. This is already evident in all major cities where homes are beyond the reach of a middle class family.
Maintaining adequate levels of sanitation is another challenge that crowded cities face. The existing infrastructure of most cities cannot absorb any more migrants. If more people arrived, cities would become filthier and less healthy. Pollution also increases with an increase in the number of residents in a place.
To conclude, traffic and transportation problems cannot be solved by encouraging all people to migrate to cities. Any such move will only worsen the quality of life in cities as most of them are already struggling to meet the basic needs of their existing population.",9,to-solve-traffic-and-transportation-problems-people-should-be-encouraged-to-live-in-cities-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
102,Pollution and other environmental damages are caused by a country developing and becoming richer.  This problem cannot be avoided.  To what extent do you agree?,"Some people argue that it is impossible for developing countries to further develop without damaging the environment. In their opinion, economic growth should be the first priority of the government. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, economic growth is important but it cannot be at the expense of the environment.
When nations develop, they will require more resources. For example, developing countries like India and China need more fuel to power their growth. Excessive consumption of fossil fuels, unfortunately, leads to the emission of carbon dioxide and accelerates the rate of global warming. This, however, does not mean that these countries should be allowed to pollute for the sake of their development. Of course, they need to develop but the need of the hour is the development of sustainable sources of energy.
All countries should invest in green and clean energy sources. For example, in nations lying on either side of the equator there is considerable potential for harnessing solar energy. Countries that produce excess amount of green energy can sell it to other countries. Rich nations that are technologically and scientifically more advanced should share the technical know-how with poor and developing nations so that they can also take advantage of newer and greener technologies for a better tomorrow.
Environmental problems are not limited to any particular country and it is foolish to claim that only those nations that pollute should do something about it. Before long, the impact of pollution caused by rapidly developing nations will also be felt in the developed world.
To conclude, since our survival depends on the environment we cannot ignore environmental problems on the pretext that they are a byproduct of development. Of course, there is a need for development but it is time we said no to development that destroys the planet.",9,pollution-and-environmental-problems-cannot-be-avoided-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
103,"Some people believe that robots are important for humans to develop their future, while others think that it is a dangerous invention that will impact society negatively.  Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Robots are being employed / deployed / used in more and more fields now. Some people think that they are essential for our progress while others insist that they are dangerous. In my opinion, robots are beneficial to mankind.
There is no denying the fact that robots have had a positive impact on the society since their introduction. They are capable of doing many things that people cannot do. For example, robots can work in extreme weather conditions or dangerous circumstances. They can be deployed to perform rescue operations in places hit by natural calamities like earthquakes. They are able to perform mundane tasks without getting bored and with utmost precision. They can even babysit and perform household chores. Another use of robots is in stores. Obviously, there are many benefits to using robots.
Some people, however, argue that robots can be dangerous. It is not possible to claim that these fears are totally baseless. In the future as robotic technology develops, we will probably have robots that can think and feel. Such robots, in my opinion, will most probably be harmful for human beings. However, I also feel that scientists will stop before we reach that stage. Another argument against robots is that they will lead to unemployment. Of course, if robots replace humans in all fields, unemployment will be a major issue. On the flip side, humans will still be needed to build, operate and maintain all those robots. That means, if robots create unemployment in one sector, they will most probably create employment opportunities in another sector.
Taking everything into consideration, I have come to the conclusion that we cannot halt the production or deployment of robots because the benefits of using robots outweigh the disadvantages if any.",9,some-people-think-robots-are-essential-for-development-others-think-they-are-dangerous-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
104,New household appliances have resulted in more free time for women and have enabled them to both work and run a home with dependent children. What are the advantages for a family when the mother works? Do you think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages?,"Thanks to the advent of advanced household appliances, many women can now take care of their family and work. This certainly benefits the family because the additional income improves the economic status of the household. However, in my opinion, working women have to struggle a lot and make many sacrifices. While I don’t think that the disadvantages of working outweigh the advantages, in my opinion, it is important for working women to have a helping hand at home.
When women work, the family is the biggest winner. The additional income will improve their living standards. Needless to say, families where both parents work can afford to buy a home and a car. They can also send their children to good schools and ensure that they have a bright future. Obviously, there are many benefits when women work.
On the flip side, women who work have to struggle hard to perform all of the tasks assigned to them. Unlike men who only have to earn a living, a working woman has to take care of family responsibilities as well. For example, she has to cook, clean and wash. She has to feed the children and help them with the homework. She also has to take care of her husband. While it is true that washing machines and refrigerators have made household jobs easier, they still take a lot of time to be done. Consequently a woman who works has little time for herself. Her day starts early and she can’t get any rest until everyone else in the family has gone to bed. Unfortunately, the additional burden takes a toll on her health and happiness.
To conclude, there is no doubt that the economic status of a family improves when women work. However, juggling a home and career is not easy for a woman and the additional responsibility affects her health and happiness. It is, therefore, imperative that she receives the utmost support of her spouse in handling household responsibilities.",9,what-are-the-advantages-for-a-family-when-the-mother-works-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
105,"Many animals are being hunted to the brink of extinction in order to fulfill the demand and greed of mankind for decorative purposes as well as for other reasons, such as traditional medicine. How can this issue be tackled?","People hunt animals to satisfy their greed and sometimes or medicinal purposes as well. For example, tigers and crocodiles are being hunted for their skin. Likewise, elephants are being killed because their tusks have great ornamental value. Some forms of medicine also use products obtained from animals. Unfortunately, excessive hunting and poaching has led to the extinction of many species. Many more are on the verge of extinction.
When animals become extinct the impact on the food chain is enormous. Before long, it will affect the balance of our ecosystem. Since humans cannot survive without other members of the food chain, it is imperative that we put a stop to mindless poaching and hunting.
Enacting stringent laws that make poaching a serious crime is definitely a step in the right direction. The government must also create awareness about the need to protect wild animals. It must bring home the fact that if animals die people will not be able to survive. The school curriculum should incorporate lessons that teach children the importance of protecting animals. In addition, the government should build wildlife sanctuaries where animals can live and breed without facing any threat from poachers.
The biggest argument in favour of hunting is that animals have medicinal value. Some alternative forms of medicine use products obtained from some wild animals. While it is true that these medicines have healing properties, that is not a reason to permit hunting. What’s more, modern medicine is evolving at a rapid pace and already most illnesses have cures that do not use any animal products. While banning traditional medicine is not a viable option, the government must enact laws that prohibit the use of endangered animals for making medicines.
To conclude, stringent laws are needed to protect animals from poaching. Poachers must be given harsh punishments. At the same time, the government must launch awareness campaigns about the need to protect animals.",9,many-animals-are-being-hunted-to-the-brink-of-extinction-how-can-this-issue-be-tackled
106,Some people think children of different ability levels should be taught together while others think intelligent children should be taught separately and given special treatment. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Some students are more intelligent than others and learn things faster. Therefore, some people insist that intelligent students should be grouped together and taught separately. I don’t agree with this view. In my opinion, separating students on the basis of their academic skills will have a negative impact on the performance of average or weak students.
It is easy to understand why some people insist that intelligent students should be taught separately. Since they learn concepts more easily, they can progress at a faster pace. This even enables them to learn much more than what is included in the standard curriculum. For example, in some schools, they give medical and entrance coaching for intelligent students as soon as they reach 7th or 8th grade. In this age of tough competition this enables them to have an edge over their peers.
However, in my opinion, this practice of separating students is unlikely to offer any real benefits. To start with, the performance of intelligent students is not affected when they are taught with average students. Of course, when there are weaker students in the class, the teacher may take longer to finish the lessons, but the standard curriculum is designed to incorporate these delays. On the flip side, separating students may further lower the grades of average students. When all the students in the class are average, they lose the motivation to work harder. What’s more, when average or weak students are taught separately, it will make them feel inferior and affect their performance. After all, nobody wants to be labeled as less intelligent or average.
To conclude, there is no real merit to separating students on the basis of their academic ability. This practice is unlikely to improve the performance of bright sides but it will definitely affect the grades of average students.",9,intelligent-students-should-be-grouped-together-and-taught-separately-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
107,"Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other sorts of progress are equally important for a country. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There is no single yardstick for measuring the progress of a nation. Some people think that economic progress is the ultimate determinant of success; others, however, insist that success in other areas is equally important. I agree with this view. In my opinion, the development of a nation is determined by various factors and financial stability is just one of them.
There is no denying the fact that financial progress is important. If a nation is economically strong, it does not have to depend on monetary assistance from other countries to carry out its developmental agenda. What’s more, rich nations enjoy good reputation overseas. They are influential and have a say in international affairs. Take, for instance, the case of United States of America. It is the richest country in the world. It is also the most influential. Obviously, financial progress is important.
However, in my opinion, financial progress alone will not help. For a nation to become developed, it has to achieve progress in all areas. For example, it has to address problems like social discrimination, economic disparity and rural and urban divide. These problems are rampant in most developing and undeveloped countries and they are the number one cause of social unrest. In addition to solving these problems, countries have to achieve development in the field of education, healthcare, science and technology. Actually, if a nation achieves progress in these areas, economic progress will follow. On the contrary, without development in these areas, it is nearly impossible to achieve economic growth.
To conclude, economic growth is just one of the measures of success. Nations that strive to become developed should work to achieve progress in all areas of life.",9,many-governments-think-that-economic-progress-is-their-most-important-goal-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
108,Some people believe that the problem of illegal drugs can be solved by just legalising all drugs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?,"The sale and consumption of drugs are illegal in almost all countries. Despite this, drugs are readily available from illegal dealers. They can even be bought online. Since illegal drugs have become quite a big problem, some people suggest that all forms of drugs should be legalised. I fully disagree with this view.
Legalising all forms of drugs will only complicate the situation. If people can walk into a nearby store and buy cocaine or marijuana, there will be a dramatic increase in the number of drug addicts all over world. Drug abuse will be particularly rampant among young people. Obviously, any attempt to legalise all drugs will be the recipe for disaster.
Of course, there are certain drugs with healing properties. For example, doctors sometimes prescribe marijuana to treat some health problems. Because of this reason, it is legal in some countries. Perhaps other countries too can legalise drugs with medical properties; however, before doing so they need to enact appropriate laws that will prevent the abuse of legalised drugs.
Consumption of drugs leads to several health problems. That is the reason drugs are banned in most countries. Many people who consume drugs are actually unaware of the harmful consequences. They get into substance abuse when they are still in their teens and at this age they are too young to understand that drugs will ultimately destroy their life. For this reason, it is imperative that the government should launch massive campaigns to create awareness about the harmful side effects of drugs. These campaigns should primarily target teens and youngsters. The government must also enact laws that give stringent punishment to drug dealers.
In conclusion, illegal drugs have become a major problem all over the world; however, legalizing them is not the solution. Instead, the government should come down hard on drug dealers. It must also create awareness about the harmful effects of drug addiction.",9,all-drugs-should-be-legalized-to-solve-the-problem-of-illegal-drugs
109,Some people like to live alone in some countries. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"Over the last few decades there has been an increase in the number of people who prefer to live alone. There are several reasons behind this trend and in my opinion, it is largely negative.
People are living alone because they want to live a life free of restrictions. They are fiercely independent and do not want to be answerable to anyone. Consequently they prefer to live alone. We are now living in the age of individualism. It is all about ‘me and my space’. Even movies and media promote this attitude to life. Also as nations become wealthier, there is an increase in per capita income as well. In the developed world, most people are financially independent. Consequently, they do not need anyone to support them. Many of them prefer to live alone because they believe that that lifestyle gives them the freedom to do whatever they want.
Unfortunately, living alone benefits neither the individual nor the society. Human beings are social animals. We thrive in the company of our family and friends. Also, contrary to what many people believe, absolute freedom is actually a bad idea. We need some limits and restrictions to lead a civilized and productive life. Also, living alone is fun only when a person is in the pink of health. When they fall ill or when they get into some problem, they need someone to help them tide over the crisis. Since finding help in such crucial situation is difficult for loners, many of them develop psychological problems like depression. This issue is particularly rampant in the western world where most of the loners live.
To conclude, financial independence and the need for total freedom are the reasons that encourage many people to live alone.

110,It is often said that children learn best by observing the behavior of adults and copying it. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"If we look around it is not hard to see that children raised by law abiding, god fearing parents demonstrate good character traits. They are a pleasure to be around and a blessing to the society. By contrast, children who grow up in the company of bad people almost always acquire bad traits. They eventually grow into notorious criminals. Therefore, I agree with the argument that children learn by observing and copying others.
Young children have highly impressionable minds. They arrive in this world with no idea of what is good or bad. The only way for them to learn is to observe others and copy their actions. When a young child behaves badly, he is not exactly aware of the fact that he is being a nuisance. Rather, he is merely demonstrating the behaviour he sees around him.
For example, if we study the lives of notorious criminals, it is easy to see that many of them had a troubled childhood. Most of the times, they came from dysfunctional families where they had no one to teach them what is good or bad. They just imitated the behaviour of the people around them and eventually turned out to be criminals. By contrast, it is extremely difficult for children raised in good households to develop bad habits. This happens only in the rare cases where the child gets into the company of bad people outside their home.
To conclude, it is evident that children learn a lot from the behaviour of the people around them. It is therefore imperative that parents who want to raise good children demonstrate good behaviour themselves.",9,it-is-often-said-that-children-learn-best-by-observing-the-behavior-of-adults-and-copying-it-band-9-ielts-essay-sample
111,"Completing university education is thought by some to be the best way to get a good job. On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Some people believe that getting a university degree will improve their career prospects while others insist that work experience and interpersonal skills are more important than university education. In my opinion, experience is certainly important but it is not as important as a degree.
Experience and soft skills certainly matter. In many industries employers will only hire people who have previous work experience in the same sector. By hiring experienced employers, they can eliminate the costs involved in training new employees. Soft skills are also important now. Gone are the days when employees could finish tasks on their own. Now they require team effort. Also in this age of globalization businesses operate from multiple locations from across the globe. In this scenario an employee requires good interpersonal skills to communicate with a customer or a client living in another part of the globe.
However, experience and soft skills alone will not help much. Jobs have become more complicated these days and it is not possible to perform them without adequate knowledge and training. For example, a person cannot practice as a doctor or an advocate without getting a degree in medicine or law. Most jobs that offer good salaries actually belong to this category. Only a candidate who has spent five or six years at university can apply for them. Experience is something that an individual gains after getting hired. It will definitely improve their chances of getting a promotion or raise. However, in order to get hired, the first thing they need is a university degree. What’s more, nowadays, universities impart much more than theoretical knowledge. They conduct workshops to give students hands-on experience. University education also provides students an opportunity to interact with others and improve their communication skills.
In conclusion, experience is certainly important and in some sectors it is indispensable. However, in my opinion, experience alone will not help a person. In fact, in this age where most jobs require specialist knowledge, most employers would not even bother to hire someone who lacks a university degree.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-completing-university-education-is-thought-by-some-to-be-the-best-way-to-get-a-good-job-on-the-other-hand-other-people-think-that-getting-experience-and-developing-soft-s
112,Some people find following a strict routine allows them to feel more in control. Others however think that constant changes to the routine make life more interesting and less predictable. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"There are certainly many benefits to having a routine. It makes our lives more organized and less stressful. However, I do not think that everything has to be done according to a pre-determined plan or timetable. In my opinion, it is perfectly all right to break the routine every once in a while.
Having a well-designed routine makes our lives less complicated. In addition, it allows us to achieve more in a day. For example, there are many benefits to waking up early in the morning. This habit is good for our health. It will also ensure that we are never late for school or work. Over time this simple habit of waking up at the same time every day will improve our grades and when we start our career it will improve our chances of getting a raise or promotion. Likewise, if exercise is part of our routine, we will enjoy good health throughout our lives. While it is true that such routines make our lives highly predictable, they also make it less complicated and that is certainly a good thing. By contrast, someone who has absolutely no routine will find it rather difficult to accomplish even simple tasks in a day.
At the same time, there is no harm in breaking the routine once in a while. For example, it is perfectly alright to skip a workout session once a week to take the children to a movie or the park. This is a great way to spend some quality time with one’s children and this occasional break from the routine will have no real impact on one’s fitness levels.

113,"In some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries. Some people think that this is good for a country, while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn. Discuss both sides and express your opinion.","In many countries there is a huge income disparity among people. This is because some people are earning astronomical salaries. At the same time, there are many more who are struggling to make both ends meet. Some people, therefore, argue that the government should cap salaries. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, this difference in salary is good for the economy because it encourages people to work harder.
If there is a limit to what people can earn, most of them will lose the motivation to work harder. The reason that encourages people to work harder and harder is their yearning to earn higher salaries. Therefore, if the government caps the salaries, it will hurt the morale of employees. Also, having a small number of people who earn too much is not necessarily a bad thing. They act as an inspiration for the poor. These super-wealthy people can also start enterprises that create jobs and improve the living standards of the poor people.
Of course, income disparity is not a good thing. It makes the poor feel inadequate. But at the same time, it encourages many of them to work harder and earn more. As human beings, we have a natural tendency to want more. We get inspired by the affluent lifestyle of the rich and want to be like them. This human desire to improve their living standards is the factor that drives all economies. The government can certainly do something to lessen the disparity. For example, it can impose higher taxes on rich people. It can also launch welfare schemes for the poor. By offering free education and health care for people living below the poverty line, the government can put them in a position to work and earn.
To conclude, capping salaries is not the solution for income disparity. Instead, the government should empower the poor people and help them earn a good salary by offering them free education and training.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-in-some-countries-a-few-people-earn-extremely-high-salaries
114,Fewer schools are requiring children to learn and improve their handwriting skills. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of this trend?,"A great deal of time, effort and patience is required to develop good handwriting. In this era where most schools use tablets in the classroom, many parents and teachers believe that hand writing has lost its importance. After all when the computers do all the writing, there is no need for children to improve their handwriting. Unfortunately, this is a negative trend and schools that ignore handwriting are doing more harm than good to their students.
Writing is an art that stimulates the brain. Consequently children who write with a pen or pencil tend to have more active and smarter brains. Also when they write with their hands, they have to learn the spelling and grammar. This improves their cognitive as well as language skills. Studies have also demonstrated links between a person’s handwriting and their character. People with good handwriting tend to be more organized and successful. They also tend to possess a greater clarity of thought.
If schools and students ignore this important skill, it may not have any immediate impact on their grades. Unfortunately, these children who cannot write even a single word neatly will eventually face problems that could even hurt their career prospects. To start with, the technology that they depend on may fail them at times. If the network connection fails or their computer breaks down, their efficiency will take a severe backing. For example, many students these days cannot write a letter or draft a report if they do not have access to the internet and a computer. They don’t know the spelling of most words. They cannot write legibly. They do not have ideas either because their critical thinking skills are almost negligible. Whenever they have a question, they just search online and they don’t memorize anything.
To conclude, students can ignore handwriting only at their peril. It is a skill that will stand them in good stead throughout their lives. It is hoped that parents and teachers will realize the importance of handwriting before it gets too late.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-fewer-schools-are-requiring-children-to-learn-and-improve-their-handwriting-skills-do-the-advantages-outweigh-the-disadvantages-of-this-trend
115,Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do much of their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged as it is good for workers and employers.,"Thanks to advancements in modern technology, people can now work from anywhere including their homes. In my opinion, this is a beneficial trend and it should be encouraged.
Working from home benefits both the employer and the employee. Most employees who work from their home use their own equipment for getting the work done. This arrangement benefits the employer because they do not have to invest in costly hardware or furniture. They can also save money on rentals and utility bills. The low operational costs will ultimately increase the profit of the organisation. In addition, when organizations allow employees to work from home at a time convenient to them, they can reduce attrition to a great extent.
The biggest benefit for employees is the time savings. On average, employees in large cities spend two to three hours a day for the daily commute. When they work from their home, they can save this time and use it for other activities. For example, they can spend more time with their family or pursue a hobby. Studies have shown that employees who get enough time for themselves are actually more productive and happier. Working from home also benefits young women who quit their jobs to take care of their children. Most of them will readily return to work if they have the opportunity to work flexible hours from their home.
To conclude, not only employees but businesses also benefit when they allow their workers to work from home. In my opinion, more organizations should realize the benefit of this practice and promote it.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-computers-and-modems-have-made-it-possible-for-office-workers-to-do-much-of-their-work-from-home-instead-of-working-in-offices-every-day
116,Some people think that new houses should be built in the same style as the older houses in the local area. Others disagree and say local authorities should allow people to build houses in the style of their own choice. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"People have different views on how new houses should be built. While some argue that new homes in a locality should be built to match the traditional building style of that area, others insist that house owners should be allowed to choose whatever design they like. In my opinion, the occupants of a house should have the freedom to decide how it should look.
There are definitely a few benefits to following the traditional style. It lends a classic look to the neighbourhood. Also, when all houses look the same, residents feel a sense of equality. People often build palatial homes to show off their wealth. By simply asking them to build a home that matches other homes in the locality the government can stop this audacious display of wealth.
On the flip side, there are many more benefits to building a home as per the needs and wants of its owner. To start with, homes that look alike lack character. A home is a reflection of the owner’s personality. It is  a space you own and for this reason, the local authorities should allow people to decide how their homes should be built. Also, traditional buildings are not very energy efficient or comfortable. Many of them also lack modern features such as attached bathrooms or modular kitchens. In addition, adding features such as CCTV cameras or burglar alarms to a traditionally built home can be a challenge.
To conclude, while it is easy to follow the historical style of building homes, in my opinion, it is important to allow people to decide how their homes should be built because a home is much more than a place to live in. It is an extension of your personality.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-think-that-new-houses-should-be-built-in-the-same-style-as-the-older-houses-in-the-local-area
117,Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement. To what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?,"There are people who believe that recycling can be encouraged / promoted by making it a legal requirement. I agree with this view to a certain extent. In my opinion, laws may help but creating adequate facilities for recycling is more important than enacting laws.
Many people are aware of the benefits of recycling; yet they prefer to dump their domestic waste on the streets or in landfills. Garbage is piling up in many cities across the world. It is the breeding ground of fleas and mosquitoes that spread diseases. If all families start the practice of recycling at least the wet garbage they produce, our cities and streets will be a whole lot cleaner and healthier.
If recycling is made a legal requirement more and more people will definitely adopt that practice. There are certainly some people who will act only if they are bound by the law. There are also many people who do not require any laws. They only need access to recycling facilities. Therefore, in my opinion, before enacting a law, the government must build recycling units in all towns and villages. If people have easy access to recycling facilities, they have no reason to throw waste around. Actually, if we make a thorough analysis of this problem we can see that in many cities where garbage is a big problem, there is a dearth of recycling facilities.
The government should also consider offering subsidies to families that want to build biogas plants to recycle their domestic waste. In addition, it can distribute compost bins for free. If there is a law and adequate recycling facilities in place, all people will certainly try to find a better use for their household waste.
To conclude, enacting a law that makes recycling a legal requirement will certainly encourage more people to adopt this practice. However, before enforcing it by law, the government has to ensure that adequate facilities are in place.",9,band-9-essay-sample-should-recycling-be-made-a-legal-requirement
118,It has been noted that many people who had a big impact on the world gave themselves completely to their work and did not bother with the idea of “work-life balance”. To what extent should people try to have a good work-life balance? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"When we study the biographies of highly successful people one thing that strikes us is the fact that they devoted their entire life to their cause. They cared for nothing else. It was this single minded devotion that helped them leave a mark behind. However, this does not mean that work-life balance is not required. Neither does it mean that just because someone spends their entire life in the workplace, they will be as famous or successful as Mohandas Gandhi, Albert Einstein or Steve Jobs.
People like Gandhi or Martin Luther King had just one mission in their life. They believed in a cause and were ready to lay their life down for that cause. Consequently, they did not care about work-life balance. Actually, their work was their life. This is not the case with the average Joe. The vast majority of people work with the sole objective of making a living. They are not exactly concerned about leaving indelible footprints behind. They only want a secure source of income. Work-life balance is important for them. In fact, if they don’t get adequate leisure time and family time, they will wilt under the work pressure.
Another thing to consider is job satisfaction. Many people do not like their jobs; yet they go to work every day because they want to put food on the table. They want to send their children to school and pay bills. They want a home and perhaps they also want a car. Actually, the only reason for them to work is to earn money to lead a comfortable life. And comfort can only come from having adequate time for oneself and all the other things that one enjoys.
In conclusion, the truly motivated are the ones who actually make a difference to the world and for them work and life are one and the same. Consequently, they do not seek any further work-life balance; however, the vast majority of employees do not belong to that category of people. They work with the sole objective of earning money so that they can enjoy life. Work-life balance is absolutely essential for them.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-to-what-extent-do-work-life-balance-matter
119,The tendency of human beings to copy one another is shown in the popularity of fashion clothes and consumer goods. To what extent do you agree?,"Nowadays, almost everyone follows the latest fashion trends. For example, we want the latest gadgets that our friends already use. Our choice of clothing is influenced by what celebrities wear. This is a clear sign that humans like to imitate others.
We copy because we want to fit in. We don’t want to stick out like a sore thumb. For example, no one, not even those who wear casuals all the time, will wear a T-shirt and jeans to a party where the dress code is formal.  This is because we have a strong need to get accepted. We do not want others to mock our style of dressing or other choices. We want to be perceived as trendy, stylish and fashionable.
The tendency to follow fashion trends stems from a basic human insecurity. We are worried that if we do not do what others do or wear what others wear, we may become less acceptable. We follow celebrities because they are already followed by millions of people. Consequently, anything that they endorse will have numerous takers. This is also a way of validating that what we are buying is a popular product. No one wants to waste their money on something that nobody else wants to buy.
Following fashion is also a great way to ensure that whether a product is good or bad, we are not the only ones spending money on it. In a sense, this justifies the purchase. So if everybody is getting the latest iPhone, that itself is a great reason for us also to get it. Worse still, not getting it can be an indication that we cannot afford it.
To conclude, humans are social animals that crave appreciation and acceptance. The easiest way to achieve this is to do what others are also doing. Following fashion trends is merely a manifestation of this basic human urge to fit in.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-the-popularity-of-fashion-clothes-show-the-tendency-of-human-beings-to-copy-one-another
120,"Nowadays more and more people want to get things done instantly (services, information, tasks). Why is this? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","These days most people want to get their work done almost instantly. They don’t have the time or patience to wait. Right now, right here is the motto. I attribute this change in attitude to the development in technology, especially internet and mobile technology and, in my opinion, it can be positive and negative at the same time.
No other technology has had a greater impact on our lives than the internet technology. To say that the internet revolutionized our lives is an understatement. It has made it possible for us to perform just about anything with a few clicks of a button. It allows us to book tickets online, buy things and pay bills anytime and from anywhere. Gone are the days when we had to stand in a long queue to buy railway tickets or pay utility bills. All of those mundane tasks can now be performed within a few seconds. The biggest advantage of the internet is that we can carry it around because it works on a variety of devices of all sizes and shapes. Obviously, it is quite normal for a generation that grew up using the internet from their childhood to want to get everything done in seconds.
However, this insistence on getting instant support or response can be positive or negative depending upon our access to technology. The internet has certainly made our lives comfortable and faster. It has allowed us to save a lot time. However, like any other technology, the internet technology can also fail us from time to time. Connection speeds vary from place to place. Also, the reliability is not the same throughout the day. It is not uncommon for people addicted to instant gratification to panic when they lose connectivity. This is a common problem when city people visit rural areas where the internet is either slow or inaccessible.
To conclude, if the present generation wants to get everything done instantly, that is because they grew up using the internet technology. While this trend is largely positive, in my opinion, over dependence on anything is bad.

121,Some people believe that studying in a college or university is the best way for students to prepare for their future career. Others think they should leave school as soon as possible to develop their career through work experience. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"While some people insist that students should go to a college or university to pursue higher education, others argue that they should start working on their career as soon as they finish high school. In my opinion, both options have their merits and demerits and it is up to the students to decide which option is better for them.
There are several benefits to pursuing higher education at university. To start with, university education equips students with the skills required to become a competent professional. For example, one cannot become a doctor or an advocate without going to university because these jobs require specialist skills that can only be obtained from an authorised educational education.  Also, university education increases the knowledge and decision making skills of students. Both qualities will benefit them when they enter the job market.
On the flip side, there are several jobs that do not require university education. For example, one doesn’t necessarily need a degree in hotel management to launch one’s own restaurant or food joint. Likewise, one does not require a degree in textiles management or garment designing to start a tailoring unit. More than any academic qualifications what these jobs require is a genuine interest in that field. Actually starting early gives budding entrepreneurs a better opportunity to establish themselves before competition gets tougher.
To conclude, while a university degree is a must for certain professions there are sectors that value work experience more. Having said that, university degrees certainly do not hurt the career prospects of a person. Rather it empowers them. In my opinion, it is up to the individual to decide whether they should go to university or find work after leaving school.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-think-that-students-should-go-to-university-to-improve-their-career-prospects
122,University students often focus on one subject. However some people think that universities should encourage a range of other subjects. To what extent do you agree?,"At school students learn a variety of subjects ranging from arts and music to literature and science. Some people insist that universities should follow the same pattern and teach a variety of students to all the students. I do not agree with this view because this method is not beneficial for the student or the society.
By the time students finish high school, they have acquired a decent understanding of a variety of subjects. For example, most of them can read and write two or three languages, do sums, identify the symptoms of common ailments and understand the basic concepts of physics, chemistry and geography. This knowledge is adequate for most people to go about their day to day lives. And for those who want to build a career in a specific field, specialization is the key. For example, someone who wants to be a doctor does not benefit from learning calculus or trigonometry. Likewise, an architect does not have to understand thermodynamics or astrophysics. Rather what they need is in depth knowledge in their field of interest.
If universities teach all subjects to all students they will not manage to produce professionals with cutting edge knowledge and expertise in specific fields. Obviously, this method of learning or teaching jeopardizes the job prospects of the students and the welfare of the society. In every society there is a need for specialists and the only way to produce specialists is to impart education that focuses on specific subjects.
To conclude, the argument that universities should teach a variety of subjects to all students does not hold water because it not only hurts the job prospects of the individual but also creates a dearth of specialists in the society.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-instead-of-focusing-on-one-subject-students-should-learn-a-variety-of-subjects
123,Some people think that children should learn to paint or draw at school. Others believe it is just a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"While some people argue that creative activities like drawing or painting should be taught at school, others insist that they are useless and should not be part of the curriculum. Both views will be discussed in this essay before arriving at a conclusion.
There are several merits to teaching drawing or painting at school. To start with, they foster the creativity of children. The very act of holding a pencil and making shapes on paper improve the motor skills and hand-eye coordination of children. This is the main reason why most schools teach drawing to primary students. Another advantage of including these lessons is that they help children to discover their inherent talents for painting or drawing. Those who have flair of drawing can then join a drawing school to hone their skills.
The main argument against making these lessons a part of the curriculum is that they waste the time of children who have no aptitude for drawing. Some parents are also disappointed that these classes rarely teach anything beyond the basics.
While these arguments might sound logical, the truth is that drawing benefits everyone. Of course, not all children who learn drawing at school will become an eminent artist when they grow up. However, this is hardly a reason to remove drawing classes from the curriculum. Even if a child does not become a professional painter in the future, she will still benefit from the improved motor coordination skills she acquired through drawing.
In conclusion, the argument that drawing lessons are useless does not hold water for the simple reason that the act of drawing improves the cognitive and intellectual skills of all children including those who have no talent for drawing.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-drawing-lessons-should-be-part-of-the-curriculum
124,"Most people pay
taxes to contribute to the development of their country
, however, some think they
have other responsibilities rather than paying taxes
. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Tax is the main source of revenue for the government. Therefore, some people feel that paying taxes is the biggest responsibility that citizens have towards their country. However, others disagree with this view. In their opinion, citizens have several other responsibilities too. I totally agree with them.
It is important to pay taxes because governments need money to fund various social and infrastructural projects. Therefore, by paying taxes each citizen is making a significant contribution to the development of their country. However, in my opinion, this is not enough. Just because someone pays taxes it does not necessarily mean that they are good citizens. It is also wrong to assume that all those poor people who do not pay taxes are not contributing anything to their country. There are lots of criminals who pay taxes. Their financial contribution to the economy is negligible when we consider the amount of damage they cause.
Tax is just one of the many contributions that a citizen can make. It is equally important for citizens to abide by the law, respect the social norms and help fellow citizens in need. When people obey the rules, respect others and do volunteer works they help create a harmonious society where everyone feels happy and safe.
Another contribution that both rich and poor people can make is towards the environment. If everyone maintains their surroundings clean and uses energy and other natural resources responsibly, not only their country but the whole planet will benefit. These are simple contributions that anyone can make and oftentimes these contributions are more valuable than paying taxes.
To conclude, paying taxes is just one way of contributing to the society. Being a law abiding citizen who volunteers to help whenever they can is even more important.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-people-have-more-responsibilities-than-paying-taxes
125,Some people think that developed countries have a higher responsibility to combat climate change than developing countries. Others believe that all countries should have the same responsibilities towards protecting the environment. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"Climate change is one of the biggest problems that we face today. Some people believe that developed nations have a greater responsibility to fight climate problems like global warming. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, developed and developing nations should work together to fight this menace that is threatening the very existence of life on the planet.
While it is true that developed nations have the resources, climate change is too grave a concern to be tackled by a handful of rich countries. This is not surprising because a big chunk of the global population lives in developing countries. As those nations develop, their need for fuel will only increase. And as they consume more fuel, they will also emit more green house gases. In this context, the argument that rich nations are responsible for tackling climate change does not hold much water.
On the flip side, developing nations need more energy to fuel their growth. If they reduce their consumption of fuel, it will have an adverse impact on their growth. A more viable solution is to ensure the participation of both developing and developed nations in the fight against environmental issues. Developed nations can use their resources and scientific knowledge to find greener sources of energy. They can then share this knowledge and technical know-how with developing nations. Meanwhile, developing nations should also contribute their bit by investing heavily in existing green technologies. For example, solar energy and wind energy are already available in all parts of the world. Governments of developing nations should encourage their citizens to switch to these sources of energy by subsidizing them. For example, the India government has announced a 20 percent tax credit on solar roofs. This is a step in the right direction.
To conclude, climate change is a grave problem that needs to be tackled with a sense of urgency. Neither developing nor developed nations can solve this problem on their own. However, if they make a joint effort, finding a solution is possible.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-developed-nations-have-a-greater-responsibility-to-tackle-climate-change
126,"An increasing number of professionals, such as doctors and teachers, are leaving their own poorer countries to work in developed countries. What problems do this cause? What solutions can you suggest to deal with this situation?","Over the last few decades there has been an increase in the number of professionals leaving their country in search of greener pastures abroad. This causes a severe talent crunch in their own country.
One of the biggest problems that countries face when talented professionals migrate is the shortage of skilled manpower. India, for example, produces tens of thousands of doctors each year and many of them migrate to foreign countries. Consequently, the country does not have enough doctors to treat its people and patients often have to wait for hours in hospitals to get their medical check-ups done. Obviously, when professionals such as doctors and teachers leave their country to find employment in the developed world, they are doing a disservice to their nation and its people.
However, there is another dimension to this problem. Many professionals choose to migrate because they are not satisfied with the opportunities available in their country. Ambition certainly is not a crime and as such the government cannot stop this practice altogether. Providing more opportunities in their own country is the only way to dissuade professionals from leaving. Also the government can perhaps make it mandatory for its citizens to return after working abroad for a fixed number of years.
Migration of professionals is both a boon and a curse. Most nations that export professionals are beneficiaries of foreign remittance. While money cannot solve the talent crisis that they face, it can certainly help them to produce more professionals in the future.  India, for example, is a big beneficiary of foreign remittance and Indian government takes immense pride in being able to export professionals to the rest of the world. The country no longer maintains a hostile attitude to its people choosing to migrate. Rather they are seen as a source of revenue with which the government can improve the ground realities at home.
To conclude, when professionals migrate to foreign countries they create an immense shortage of talent in their own country. The only way the government can discourage this practice is to create more opportunities in their own country using the money they remit.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-when-professionals-migrate-to-foreign-countries-what-problems-they-create-in-their-own-country
127,Some people believe that government money should be spent on important things than arts such as painting and music. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Whether art and artists should receive government funding has always been a topic of debate. Some people argue that the government should spend its money on more important things like health and education instead of sponsoring artists and art events. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, it is important to spend on sectors like healthcare, education and infrastructure. This, however, does not mean that art and artists can be neglected.
Artists can’t save lives or build bridges, but they still contribute to the society in their own way. Music, for example, soothes the mind. Listening to music is actually the favourite pastime of busy professionals who lead extremely stressed out lives. In other words, by supporting music and musicians, the government is indirectly helping the emotional wellbeing of its people. Likewise, dancers enthrall the audience with their performance. Cultural programmes like music and dance draw a large audience and generate money. By simply organizing such events for art lovers and tourists, the government can not only help budding artists who need an avenue to showcase their talent but also generate revenue that can be used for developing other sectors.
Tourism is a major source of revenue for governments all over the world and artists have immense power to attract tourists. For example, Indian classical dances and music have always fascinated a large number of tourists. They visit the country to watch these performances and even enroll in dance and music schools here to learn the art. This is a source of revenue for the government.
To conclude, nobody is asking the government to promote arts at the expense of other sectors. Any such move would be suicidal. Instead, what the government needs to do is to earmark a small portion of its revenue for the promotion of arts. Like any other sector, arts also generate jobs and help the society on the whole.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-should-governments-support-art-and-artists
128,"Some people support the development of factory farming and the scientific creation of fruits and vegetables in agriculture, but others oppose these developments. Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.","Scientists are looking for various methods such as factory farming to improve the quality and quantity of agricultural products. While some people support scientific methods of cultivation, others oppose them. In my opinion, these methods will increase the quantity of the produce; however, its quality will be affected.
Farmers can significantly increase their yield by adopting scientific methods of cultivation. As population increases, the demand for food products also increases. The only way to meet this need is to increase production. Since conventional methods of farming are not very effective, modern methods like factory farming are the need of the hour. They help to increase yield and make food products available to people all over the world. Scientific methods also increase the shelf life of agricultural products. Consequently, many seasonal fruits and vegetables are now available throughout the year. Scientists have even managed to grow cold climate fruits like apples and grapes in the warm tropics.
On the flip side, scientific farming may have a negative impact on the quality of the products. Animals raised in factory farms are often given steroids and antibiotics to grow faster. When people consume the meat of these animals, these chemicals also enter their body. Another source of controversy is the cultivation of GM crops. They are drought resistant and pest resistant and give excellent yields. However, even scientists are not sure whether they are fully safe for consumption.
To conclude, modern methods of farming certainly increase yield and as such the adoption of such practices are required to meet the growing demand for food products. However, quality of these products is certainly a cause of concern. It will be great if scientists manage to address those concerns.",9,band-9-ielts-sample-about-factory-farming-and-scientific-creation-of-fruits-and-vegetables
129,Some people say that parents should encourage their children to take part in organised group activities in their free time. Others say that it is important for children to learn how to keep themselves occupied on their own.,"Some people feel that children should spend their spare time doing group activities; others opine that children should find ways to keep themselves busy on their own. In my opinion, both options have their merits and demerits.
Engaging in organized group activities is certainly beneficial for children. To start with, such activities are safe because children will almost always have someone to supervise them while they play. Also, they can learn several valuable skills like team spirit and cooperation when they play a team sport or get involved in a group activity. For example, when children play a sport like football or cricket, they learn the importance of working with their teammates to achieve their common goal. Such skills will benefit them in their future. These activities also enhance the confidence levels and interpersonal skills of children.
On the flip side, it is not always possible to participate in group events. There are times when a child is left alone. For example, his friends could be busy with their studies and cannot play with him. Since such situations can arise every now and then, every child should be able to keep themselves occupied doing their own things. For example, they could read, write or paint. These activities not only keep them engaged, but also help them discover their hidden talents.
The important downside to spending time alone is that children may use it for unproductive activities. For example, if they are left alone most children will just sit glued to their television or computer. This practice, unfortunately, does not help them in any way.
To conclude, it is important for children to find a way to keep themselves occupied on their own.

130,Some think the best way to motivate and encourage people to work hard is to pay them based on how much they produce and sell. Do you agree or disagree? Include relevant examples from your own experience.,"Employees give their best when they are motivated. Some people feel that offering them salaries commensurate with the revenue they generate for the organization is the best way to enhance their productivity. I completely agree with this view.
Money motivates most people and it is not surprising. Financial security is crucial for all employees. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for organizations to come up with a pay package that compensates employees adequately for their performance. If employees are offered fixed salaries, they have no real reason to put in their best effort because their contribution has no real impact on their salary.
On the other hand, if the company offers higher remunerations to employees who close more deals or generate more revenue, all employees will be motivated to work harder. This, in turn, will enhance the revenues of the organization. For example, my management promised me a promotion and a higher salary on the successful closure of a million dollar deal with one of our esteemed clients. Since I always wanted to see myself as a manager this offer motivated me to work hard and this resulted in the closure of the deal within six months. Several organizations are already experimenting with this practice. In addition to a fixed salary, they offer their employees a commission on every sale they complete.
To conclude, the performance of an employee is closely related to their level of motivation. Motivated employees work harder and contribute more to the bottom line of an organization. Since money is what motivates most people, paying employees on the basis of their contribution makes perfect sense.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-the-best-way-to-motivate-employees-is-to-offer-them-financial-incentives
131,Some people believe that children are given too much free  time. They feel that this time should be used to do more school work. How do you think children should spend their free time?,"Nowadays both parents and teachers give undue importance to academic grades. Some people feel that since children get too much free time, they should use it to do their school work. I do not agree with this view.
To start with, the argument that children get too much free time does not hold water. Most of them already spend 7 or 8 hours at school and afterwards they have coaching classes to attend and homework to do. Most kids receive barely one or two hours of free time in a day and asking them to use that time for school work is outrageous to say the least.
Over emphasis on academics stems from the belief that school grades are an indicator of a child’s future success. However, this is not always the case. If we look around we can see that many of the super successful people in our world are college dropouts. While it is true that we are now living in an age of cut throat competition there is nothing to prove that only A graders can succeed in life. Success, in fact, depends on a variety of factors and academic grades are just one of them. A person’s communication skills, overall personality and character traits also play a crucial role in determining their chances of finding success and happiness in life. Therefore, in my opinion, parents should encourage children to pursue their non-academic interests during their free time. For example, they should be allowed to play a sport or learn a musical instrument. Engaging in such activities is a great opportunity for them to beat stress and gain physical strength and stamina.
To conclude, leisure is important for the overall development of children and hence instead of asking them to complete their school work during their free time, parents should allow them to play and be themselves.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-children-should-spend-their-free-time-doing-school-work
132,"Most Countries allow 18 year olds to start driving a car. Some say it is good to allow it at this age, while others think that the age to start driving should be at least 25. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In most countries the legal driving age is 18. Some people feel that this age should be increased to 25. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, 18 year olds are physically and mentally fit to drive a vehicle.
Most countries have constitutions that treat 18 year olds as adults. At this age, a person has attained physical maturity. Many teens of this age have finished their studies and are ready to work and earn money. Also, young people learn to drive faster than older people. So, obviously, the argument that they cannot drive at this age does not hold much water.
Some people, however, are worried that young men and women of this age are not emotionally mature. So, they feel that the driving age should be increased to 25. Their biggest argument is that teens are not mature enough to drive responsibly. This is a true to a certain extent. Speed thrills young people. Many of them also fail to acknowledge the importance of adhering to traffic rules. They may drink and drive; they may refuse to wear helmets; they may exceed speed limits. All of these are tendencies that make them dangerous drivers. However, increasing the driving age to 25 is not the solution to this problem. Instead young people should be given counselling. They should be taught the importance of driving safely and responsibly. Parents, driving schools and media can all drive home the message that speed kills.
To conclude, there are arguments for and against allowing driving at 18. While I do admit that young drivers can be rash, in my opinion, proper counselling will make them more responsible and mature. Therefore, I support the view that driving should be allowed at 18.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-should-driving-age-be-increased-to-25
133,"Most people in the world need to work in order to lead a decent life or even just to survive. Many workers are motivated by money: if the job pays well, they are willing to do it. However, some people are not concerned with the size of their pay packet: they simply enjoy their job and choose to do it whether they earn a high salary or not. What is more important – salary or job satisfaction? Discuss and give reasons for your answer.","Some people choose high paying jobs. Others prefer jobs they find satisfying even if the salary is low. While I admit that it is important to earn enough to make a living, in my opinion, job satisfaction is more important than the size of the pay package.
Job satisfaction increases productivity. If people like their jobs, no one has to force them to go to work. No one has to supervise them. They will perform their job on their own and with utmost interest and concentration. This interest that they show will automatically improve the results and help them achieve more in less time.
By contrast, people who choose a particular job just because it is paying well will find it rather difficult to stay motivated. They have to push themselves to work every morning. Because of this lack of interest in the job, they make more errors and take longer to finish tasks. As a result, they have to stay late at office. The long working hours will eventually affect their health and family life. Take, for instance, the case of IT professionals. The IT industry pays well but the jobs are extremely stressful and demanding. Someone who chooses a job in this industry just because the salaries are good will eventually burn out unable to cope with the pressures of the job.
On the flip side, rewarding jobs may not always pay well at the beginning. But over time, the worker’s enthusiasm and dedication will make the job a lucrative career option. For example, there are lots of people who turned their hobbies into successful career options. It was their love for the job that ultimately helped them.
To conclude, job satisfaction is certainly more important than the money earned. If people love their job, eventually, they will also earn well.

134,"Some people think that to learn about other countries, they need to travel. Some say that it is not necessary to travel; we can have information through TV and internet. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some people are of the opinion that in order to know about other nations, it is necessary to travel. However, I believe that people can learn about other nations by watching television and using the internet.
On the one hand, some people argue that travelling is the best way to learn more about other nations. They think that without travelling it is not possible to learn much about the cultures, traditions and even languages of other nations. For instance, in their opinion, travelling allows us to interact with local people and know what they like and dislike. In addition, they believe that travelling is a great way to practise a language with its native speakers. This will significantly improve the ability to speak other languages. So, in these people’s opinion, the best way to learn about other nations is to travel.
On the other hand, there are people who insist that we can get all the information we need about other countries online and on television. I strongly agree with them. There are many websites that contain everything about every country on this planet. Information about foods, cultures, traditions, languages and weather can be found on websites such as Wikipedia and YouTube. It is also possible to meet different people from other countries online and befriend them. For example, I personally have friends from different countries around the world whom I have met online. As a result, I have sufficient information about their countries without setting my foot on their lands. This clearly shows that people can learn about other nations without physically travelling to them.
To sum up, although travelling is a great way of learning about other countries, I firmly insist that all information about other nations can be obtained through television and online.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-to-learn-about-other-countries-it-is-important-to-travel-to-them
135,Some people believe that children are given too much free time. They feel that this time should be used to do more school work. How do you think children should spend their free time?,"Some people feel that children get too much free time. In their opinion, kids should use their spare time to do their school assignments. I do not agree with me. In my opinion, free time is essential for the overall growth and development of children and it should not be used for academic work.
To start with, I do not agree with the view that children get a lot of free time. Most children spend a great deal of time at school and once they get home they have to do their homework. Therefore, it is unfair to ask them to do their school work in the few spare hours they get. Parents and teachers who insist that children should only study and not play are actually doing them a major disservice.
Contrary to what some people believe, leisure is actually important for the wellbeing of both children and adults. Free time allows children to relax and engage in activities they enjoy. Studies have shown that children who play well are actually healthier and more intelligent. Obesity has become a major health problem among children who lead a sedentary lifestyle. By encouraging them to play a physical sport in their free time, parents can actually protect them from a variety of ailments.
Since physically active children fall ill less often they do not miss many school days. Actually both factors improve their grades in school. They are also happier than their counterparts who are always busy with their studies. Better still, free time allows children to discover and hone their latent talents.
To conclude, the argument that children should do their school work in their free time is meaningless. In order to succeed in life they should not only study but also play.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-children-have-too-much-free-time
136,"Children are facing more pressures nowadays from academic, social and commercial perspectives. What are the causes of these pressures and what measures should be taken to reduce these pressures?","Children are under tremendous pressure these days. They are required to excel in their studies as well as in extra-curricular activities. They are also required to have a brilliant career once they grow up.
Parental pressure is the number one cause of stress on children. Parents want their kids to be super achievers. They do not really care whether their child has the required talent or not. Most children now get hardly any time to play or socialize. They spend much of the day in schools and coaching centres. And afterwards they attend music, drawing and sports lessons. Many of them get barely five or six hours of sleep. Yet, both parents and teachers expect them to stay alert in the class and score excellent grades in their exams.
Children are too young to cope with any kind of pressure. Since stress and tension affect their emotional, physical and intellectual development, it is important to shield them from unwanted pressures. Parents need to realize that by expecting too much from their children they are actually setting themselves up for failure and disappointment. Instead they should have realistic goals and ambitions. Time management is equally important. The child should spend their energy on only those things that truly matter. For example, a child who has no real talent for singing should not have to attend music lessons. Likewise, children who are not very sporty should be allowed to skip sports practice. They can use the time thus saved on other activities they are interested in.
To conclude, the gap between reality and expectation is the real cause of pressure on children. Since pressure affects the normal growth and development of children, it is important to shield them from unwanted pressure. Both parents and teachers can make life less stressful for children by setting realistic goals for them.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-children-are-facing-more-pressures-these-days
137,"In many countries, very few young people read newspapers or follow the news on TV. What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?","Few young people are interested in reading the newspapers or watching news channels. This is definitely a negative development with long lasting consequences.
Newspapers and news channels give too much importance to politics and economics and youngsters have little interest in these topics. This is the main reason that discourages them from reading or watching news. Consequently, they have little knowledge of national or international affairs. This is a negative development because young people are the present and the future of the nation. If they are unaware of the happenings around them, they will not be able to play an active role in nation building.
Another reason that discourages young people from reading news stories is the information explosion. We are now living in an age where we get bombarded with new bits of information every second. These days news breaks on social media sites like Twitter. When information is available in 140 characters, nobody is interested in reading a 2000 word news story. Unfortunately, there is a downside to this. Social media only provide news; in order to get views we have to read in depth news stories like the ones published in newspapers. Also, it is not always possible to trust information found on the internet. Anyone can post anything online and there is no reliable way to check whether what we have read is true or not.
In order to encourage young people to consume news, newspapers and news channels should make a conscious effort to present news in a way that appeals to young readers. Editors and reporters need to realize that in this fast paced world, no one has the time to read a long, winding story. Making information available in byte sizes will definitely help.
To conclude, young people are turning a blind eye to newspapers and news channels because much of the information available from these sources does not interest them or is not made available in an easy-to-digest format. Media houses need to rethink their preferences and make some drastic changes to their style of reporting to encourage more and more young people to consume news.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-few-young-people-read-newspapers
138,Smacking children is the best form of discipline. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Children often misbehave and when they do that many parents smack them to teach them a ‘lesson’. In my opinion, this behaviour is completely unacceptable. Smacking traumatises children and may even lead to more behavioural problems.
There are many reasons why parents feel that smacking is the best form of discipline. To begin with, many of them are under the wrong impression that children will get the point if they are smacked for bad behaviour. This, according to some parents, will discourage them from repeating the bad behaviour. Some parents also want to have absolute control over their children and often resort to this barbaric practice to show them who is in charge of the household.
Unfortunately, smacking does not help with the behavioural issues in children. In fact, it makes their problems worse. Studies have shown that children who grow up in households where they are regularly subjected to smacking and other forms of physical violence are more likely to grow into rebellious teenagers. They start to detest their elders and may also develop a hatred for authority. Of course, when parents spank their children, this is not the end result they are hoping to achieve.
Having said that, it is important to discipline children. Behavioural problems need to be dealt with but instead of resorting to physical violence parents should set an example for their children. Children learn a lot by watching and imitating adults. If parents behave appropriately at all times, children will consciously or unconsciously copy their behaviour and that will solve the issue.
To conclude, children are our future and we must raise them with love, patience and tolerance. Good parenting and physical violence cannot co-exist. Therefore, in my opinion, smacking children must be forbidden and parents who still resort to this practice must be severely punished by the law.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-smacking-children-is-the-best-form-of-discipline
139,Solar energy is becoming more and more popular as a source of household energy in many countries around the world. Why is this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy?,"Over the last few years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of homes powered by solar energy. Many factors contribute to this growing popularity of solar power.
Energy requirements are growing rapidly due to industrialisation and urbanisation. In order to meet this growing demand it is important to tap into new energy sources. Solar fits the bill perfectly. It is a renewable source. Unlike other energy sources like coal or petroleum, the source of solar energy – the sunlight – is non-perishable. That means as long as the world exists we will be able to harness the power of the sun. Also, unlike conventional energy sources like coal or petrol, solar energy is clean and green.
However, solar energy also has some limitations. Although technology has improved, solar energy is still more expensive than conventional energy. The initial cost of installation of solar panels is also quite high. Various other factors such as the lack of a support system for repairs and the difficulty in getting replacements are also hindering large scale adoption of solar power systems.
Another issue is the limited availability of sunlight in many parts of the world. There are many countries that do not receive any sunlight during certain periods of the year. They certainly cannot rely on a volatile power source like the sun.
To conclude, the growing popularity of solar power can be attributed to the fact that it is clean and renewable. Of course, solar power has its limitations too, but I believe that as the technology develops solar will become more popular than conventional energy sources.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-about-the-growing-popularity-of-solar-energy
140,Many people think that important things in life are mostly free or can’t be bought. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.,"Some people think that the things that truly matter in life are free or cannot be bought with money. I completely agree with this view.
Money can only buy material comforts. While these are also important in life, in my opinion, they are not the most important things. I have seen many poor people who lead happy and content lives in spite of their poverty. I have also seen many rich people who lead miserable lives in spite of having all the money in the world. If money could buy happiness, the rich must be the happiest in the world. The reality, however, is different.
In my opinion, the most important things in life are love and friendship and neither can be bought with money. Parents’ love, for example, is the biggest gift a person receives in their lifetime and it is free. You may be the poorest person in the world but that will not stop your parents from loving you.
Relationships with our family and friends are actually the things that keep us going and they are free. Just because you are poor it does not mean that you cannot be in a meaningful relationship. In fact, if you have a nice character and a kind personality, you will have no dearth of friends. By contrast, a rich person with an arrogant personality and a bossy attitude may be lonely in life because no one wants to be with them.
To conclude, while it is true that money can buy many things, truly important things in life like love and relationships are actually free and cannot be bought.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-the-most-important-things-in-life-are-free
141,Nowadays more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots. Why do you think it is happening? Is it a negative or positive development?,"Today, technological innovations like robots have become an integral part of our lives. We use them to perform a variety of tasks both at home and work. In my opinion, this is a positive development and there are several social and economic reasons behind this.
First, our lifestyle has changed dramatically over the years. We have become super busy. We have demanding careers and a happening social life. We want to achieve as much as we can both on the professional front and in the personal space. Obviously, this requires time. Since we all have only twenty-four hours in a day, the need for time saving gadgets increases. Robots meet this demand perfectly. They can perform many mundane tasks faster and more efficiently than us. They can cook, clean and wash. Some robots can even babysit. Needless to say, they are invading our homes and offices and that is quite understandable. Take, for instance, the case of the cleaning robot ROMBA. More and more Americans are using it today it allows them to save a great deal of time which they can use to perform more rewarding tasks like studying, working or socializing.
The growing popularity of robots is generally a positive trend. Robots do not get tired or bored. They will happily perform the same task for hours on end. And unlike humans, they are less likely to make mistakes. While safety can still be an issue, the technology is developing fast and we will soon have a solution to safety concerns as well.
To conclude, the growing popularity of robots can be attributed to the fact that they allow us to save a lot of time. In my opinion, this is a positive trend that needs to be encouraged.

142,Keeping animals in captivity is cruel.  There is no reason for zoos to exist in the 21st century.,"There are many people who question the existence of zoos in the 21st of century. In their opinion, keeping animals in captivity is unethical. While I do agree with this view, I do not think that zoos should be abolished.
In spite of all the arguments against the existence of zoos, the truth is that they still benefit both humans and animals. Zoos provide education. They give us an opportunity to observe wild animals from close quarters and learn about their behavior. Another very important benefit of maintaining zoos is that they save many endangered species from extinction. Zoos provide them with a safe environment where they can live and reproduce. Without zoos many exotic species of animals would have disappeared from earth.
The argument against the existence of zoos stems from the fact that they ill-treat animals. That is true to a certain extent. In many zoos, animals are kept in small enclosures where they cannot even move about. Such zoos exist with the sole purpose of making money by exploiting animals. In my opinion, such establishments should be closed down as we have no right to use or exploit other forms of life for our benefit.
Having said that, there are also zoos that allow animals to live in protected environments that are closer to the wilderness. Animals living in such zoos do enjoy some amount of freedom. They might even be able to hunt small animals that the zoo authorities throw into their ‘territories’. Life in such zoos actually benefits these animals because they are safe from poachers who might otherwise have killed them for their skin, teeth or tusks.
To conclude, when we consider the benefits of zoos, it is not hard to see that the argument against their existence does not hold water. Zoos do protect animals. Instead of abolishing them, what we need to do is to make them more animal friendly.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-there-is-no-place-for-zoos-in-the-twenty-first-century
143,"Some people think that politicians have the greatest influence on the world, while others believe that scientists are more influential.","Some people argue that politicians have the utmost impact on the world; however, others disagree. In their opinion, scientists are the most influential people on the planet. I agree with this latter group. In this essay, I will explain why I think scientists are more influential than politicians.
There is no denying the fact that politicians are influential. After all, they rule the nations of the world. They make laws. They sign international agreements. They can even decide whether we need war or peace. Take, for instance, the case of the World Wars. While the wars were fought by the soldiers, the decision to go to war was taken by politicians. Obviously, the argument that politicians are influential is understandable.
Yet, in my opinion scientists are more powerful. We wouldn’t have reached where we are today without the advancements in science and technology. Scientists have invented life saving drugs and vaccines which gave us a chance to stand up to deadly diseases. They invented the light bulbs, the automobiles, refrigerators and computers. As we can see, it is impossible to imagine a life without these inventions now. The missiles and bombs that can win a war for politicians were also invented by scientists. So, if there weren’t any scientists, we would most probably still be living in caves. The impact of politicians on our lives is negligible when we consider the impact of scientists and their inventions.
To conclude, while it is true that politicians are influential, their influence is much less pronounced than the influence of scientists.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-scientists-are-more-influential-than-politicians

146,Few people devote time to hobbies nowadays. Why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.,"Nowadays, very few people pursue a hobby. In my opinion, this is not a positive trend because not having a hobby can have a detrimental effect on people. We are now living in a highly stressful and competitive environment where a hobby can be a stress buster. Hobbies are also beneficial for the society because people who have a hobby are less likely to get into crime.
Everybody is busy these days and as such they have no time for hobbies. People have demanding jobs and careers that do not give them any spare time. Not surprisingly very few people pursue hobbies these days. Another factor that discourages people from having a hobby is the easy access to other sources of recreation.
We now live in an age where we receive new and exciting information every millisecond. Thanks to the advent of technologies like the internet and the smart phone people are constantly glued to their screens. The only pastime they have is checking and updating their social profiles. Unfortunately, unlike a hobby internet addiction is actually harmful to the individual. Of course, it helps them to kill their time but most people who spend a lot of time on the internet and social media websites are actually unhappy about their lives. They feel inadequate and crave for more.
A hobby, on the other hand, is an emotionally fulfilling pursuit. It can even lead to financial benefits. For example, someone who pursues painting or blogging as a hobby will probably be able to turn that into a lucrative career. Studies have also shown that hobbies benefit the society as a whole. They give a purpose to life and keep people occupied. As a result people who have a hobby are less likely to get into antisocial and criminal activities.
To conclude, easy access to other sources of recreation is the main reason that discourages people from having a hobby. However, this is a bad development and can have long lasting negative consequences for the individual and the society.",9,band-9-essay-sample-few-people-have-a-hobby-these-days
147,Restricting air travel is the only way to prevent air pollution. Do you agree?,"Some people believe that the only way to reduce air pollution is to limit the number of flights. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, restricting air travel is unlikely to have any real impact on air quality. At the same time, it may adversely affect the economy of the nation.
There is no denying the fact that aeroplanes cause air and noise pollution. They produce too much noise and emit harmful gases. While it is possible to control this pollution by reducing the number of flights, it will not fully solve the problem because the majority of pollutants in the air do not come from aircrafts. It is true that air travel has become more affordable and popular recently. However, aeroplanes still are not the primary mode of transport for the majority of people and as such they cannot be considered the number one cause of air pollution. In fact, cars and buses cause more pollution than flights because there are too many of them on the road.
What’s more, restricting air travel can have disastrous consequences for the economy. The tourism industry will be the worst hit because limited availability of flights will discourage tourists from visiting foreign countries. Import and export of goods will also be affected. Since both of these factors will affect the financial growth of the country, I do not believe that governments will want to limit air travel.
To conclude, restricting air travel is unlikely to improve air quality much because aeroplanes are not the biggest polluters on the planet. What’s more, any such move will have serious economic consequences.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-about-air-travel-and-air-pollution

They believe that certain workers deserve to retire and receive a pension at an early age.","Nowadays many people believe that setting a fixed retirement age for all professionals is not fair. I am in complete agreement with this view as a lot of occupations can use extended services; however, it is equally beneficial for professionals working physically demanding sectors to receive early retirement.
On the one hand, there are jobs which require tremendous amount of experience and expertise which workers gain over a period of time, and putting an end to their employment because of their age is just unfair to the knowledge and effort they put in. For instance, researchers and scientists devote their entire life to their work, and asking them to quit just because of age is cruel, especially since the society will benefit from their work. Similarly, teachers should also be allowed to impart their knowledge till the time they can, as in my opinion without their service our progress will be much slower.
On the other hand, I would like to say that professionals working in army and police will extensively benefit from an early retirement programme, because of  the intense physical strength and demanding schedules required to fulfill their duties. Moreover, an early retirement will give them a chance to be with their families which otherwise becomes impossible for them, due to the postings at non family stations.
In the end, I would like to conclude by stating that there must be an option for voluntary early retirement for those who need it due to the nature of their job profiles, and an opportunity of extended employment for those who want to work longer as age is just a number for them.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-sample-it-is-unfair-to-have-a-fixed-retired-age-for-all-professionals
150,"Nowadays celebrities are more known for their glamour and wealth than for their achievement, and this sets a bad example to young people.","These days, celebrities are making headlines more for their glamour and their money than their professional accomplishments. Some argue that by flaunting a luxurious lifestyle, they are setting a negative example for youngsters. I don’t quite agree with this view. While I admit that celebrities influence their audience, in my opinion, they are not responsible for the behaviour of young people.
Media gives undue coverage to famous people for the simple reason that their viewers are interested in the private lives of celebrities. One cannot blame celebrities for this. After all, they are also human beings and it is quite natural for them to have flaws. In any case, they do not ask their fans to do what they do. The problem with young people is that many of them blindly follow film stars or sports personalities. Naturally, when they see their favourite star flaunting a flashy lifestyle, they want it for themselves. This, unfortunately, leads to many problems. Famous people are usually rich and have the means to support their extravagant lifestyle. Most of their fans, however, hail from ordinary backgrounds. In their quest to live like their stars, they may even get into crimes. Many star-struck teenagers are ready to do just about anything to make money so that they can live like film stars.
However, the root cause of the problem here is not the flashy lifestyle of celebrities. When we look closer, it is not hard to see that if young people are getting misled by celebrities, the problem is with them and the parenting they received. It is important for everyone to learn to live within their means and to have a moral code of conduct. They should learn to separate the wheat from the chaff. Parents and teachers can help them to distinguish the good from the bad.
To conclude, while it is true that celebrities influence young people, it is wrong to blame them for the wrongdoings of their followers. Everyone is required to have a set of moral principles to guide them through life and nobody is supposed to blindly imitate others.",9,band-9-essay-sample-celebrities-mislead-young-people
151,The reason that most individuals are in debt is due to the overuse and irresponsible use of credit cards. Banks should not issue credit cards unless they are completely sure of an individual’s ability to pay back their debts.,"Careless and irresponsible use of credit cards push many people into debt. Some people, therefore, argue that banks should ensure the customer’s ability to pay off their debts before issuing credit cards to them. I agree with this view. While I insist that banks should check the credit history of a person before offering them credit cards, in my opinion, this may not always help because the financial stability of a person can change any time. So there is no way banks can fully verify the repayment capacity of the customer.
Irresponsible use of credit cards can push anyone into the debt trap. Still, the demand for credit cards continues to increase. People consider credit cards as a means to improve lifestyles. They borrow more money than they should as the credit cards are easy to use and readily acceptable in so many places. Unfortunately, some people cannot pay back the debts and get into huge financial trouble.
Banks usually won’t issue credit cards if they are not completely satisfied with the finances of the customer. They always check the credit history and financial situation of the customer and also explain the burdensome consequences that can happen to the customer if they use the card irresponsibly. Still, many people use the card carelessly and get into permanent debt. So it is unfair to blame the bank alone for the credit card holder’s mistakes.
Another factor that we need to acknowledge is the unpredictable nature of a person’s financial situation. People can fall ill or lose their job. Both of these are situations that can considerably affect a person’s ability to repay his debt. In most cases such situations cannot be predicted and are not in the control of either the bank or the customer.
To conclude, it is important for the banks to verify the customer’s ability to pay back debts before giving them credit cards. Customers also have a responsibility to control their spending habits to protect themselves from debt.

152,"‘Some people think that changing  people’s attitudes to other countries, and culture is an important factor in reducing world poverty. Others, however, feel that the most important method is trade.’","Only a small percent of the world’s population lives in rich countries. Yet, they own more than 80 percent of the global wealth. Some people claim that we need to change our attitude towards other countries to eradicate poverty from the world. Others feel that increasing trade is the solution. In my opinion, we need a change in attitude as well as a boost in trade.
Nations are obsessed with their boundaries. They only want to take care of the people living within their boundaries. If eliminating poverty from the world is the goal, countries and their people have to think beyond their boundaries. People need to realize that everyone irrespective of their nationality, religion or ethnicity belong to one family – humanity. Rich countries already have a considerable amount of wealth lying unused in their coffers. The moment they start using this wealth for the betterment of humanity, poverty will be a thing of past. This, of course, requires a change in their attitude towards poor countries and their people.
An increase in trade is important too. It is wrong to assume that a nation can progress entirely on financial aid received from other countries. While foreign aid certainly helps in building infrastructure and other facilities, it does not arrive in unlimited amounts. Therefore rather than placing too much reliance on international aid, poor countries should try to boost their domestic and international trades to create jobs and improve their economies.
To conclude, rather than leaving the poor countries to their fate, rich countries should come forward to solve the problems plaguing them. People need to realize that irrespective of their skin colour or nationality, they all belong to one species and as such it is their duty to give help where it is required. This is not possible without changing our attitude towards other countries and people.",9,band-9-essay-sample-rich-nations-should-change-their-attitude-towards-poor-nations-to-eradicate-poverty
153,"Art is considered an essential part of all cultures throughout the world. However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology and business.","Art has always played a vital role in enriching cultures all over the world. However, people are showing less and less interest in art these days. In this essay, I will analyse the reasons behind this trend and also suggest possible ways to boost people’s interest in arts.
While it is true that art enriches culture, it plays little or no role in improving our lives. For example, one does not have to admire great paintings or marvel at brilliant sculptures to live comfortably. This is not exactly the case with the contributions of science and technology. Take, for instance, the case of electricity or computers. It is impossible to imagine a life without these technological innovations. Needless to say, people are showing more interest in science than in arts. Science and business also create more jobs and sustain economies.
Another reason for the diminishing popularity of art is that it has lost the patronage of governments. During the monarchy artists enjoyed considerable attention. While governments still support art and artists no special incentive is given to produce masterpieces of art.
Art and culture co-exist. One cannot survive without the other. That explains the importance of preserving art. One way of doing this is to make art a viable career option. The government should create jobs in this sector by opening more and more art galleries and organizing exhibitions and cultural programmes. This will encourage more students to pursue art at school and colleges.
To conclude, the most effective way to nurture art is to capitalize on its economic potential. The government can do this by creating jobs in this sector.

154,"Some people think that they should spend money they earn now enjoying life, while others think that the money should be put into savings for future.","There are people who enjoy spending money. They simply cannot resist the urge to splurge. There are also people who believe in saving every penny they earn. In my opinion, neither approach is correct.
It is impossible to get something for nothing. We have to earn money to live comfortably. There are certain expenses that cannot be done away with. For example, we all need food to eat and clothes to wear. We also have a responsibility to take care of our dependent children, parents and spouse. All of these are good reasons to spend money.
However, I am against spending money just for the sake of it. There are people who spend every penny they earn. They buy things without even bothering to check whether they actually need them. While spending might give them some momentary pleasures, they will soon find themselves in deep financial problems. There is no harm in enjoying life by going on a holiday or buying latest fashion clothes or accessories. However, one must ensure that one is not spending more than one can afford. Also, emergencies may arise any time. For example, one can fall ill or lose job. It is impossible to tide over such crises without adequate savings.
Just like some people enjoy spending, there are also some people who enjoy saving. In their relentless quest to save as much as they can, they deprive themselves of the little pleasures in life. These people may have huge bank balances but they fail to enjoy life. Life is short and no one can carry their savings with them to the other world. It is therefore pointless to save all the money one earns without enjoying the little pleasures of the world. Happiness, after all, is the biggest wealth.
To conclude, the very purpose of earning money is to lead a comfortable life. This requires one to save and spend in the right amounts.",9,band-9-essay-sample-should-we-spend-money-or-save-it-for-future
155,Many museums and  historical sites are mainly visited by tourists  but not local people. Why is this the case and what can be done to attract local people to visit these places?,"Museums and monuments showcase the rich history and culture of a nation. Most of these places attract a large number of tourists; however, local people show little interest in them. There are several reasons behind this trend.
To start with, local people give museums and historical places a miss because they offer nothing new to them. They are already familiar with their culture and history and perhaps have nothing new to discover by frequenting the same museums again and again. A tourist, on the other hand, may enjoy visiting a museum or monument because of the numerous windows they open to the past. Another reason that dissuades local people from visiting museums is that they are rarely updated. What they showcase this month is in no way different from what they showcased last month or last year. Therefore, although they will figure in a tourist’s itinerary, for natives regular visits to such places are quite boring. Cost could also be a factor. Most museums and monuments charge an entry fee which could be an issue for low or middle income families.
The government and local authorities can take several simple steps to rekindle locals’ interest in museums. They can, for example, organize regular exhibitions, cultural events and light shows that provide visitors a new experience every time they visit these places. Scraping the entry fee may also help.
To conclude, if local people prefer to stay away from museums and monuments, that is because these institutions fail to offer new experiences to them. Authorities should consider organizing various cultural programmes and shows at these places to encourage more local people to visit them.",9,band-9-essay-sample-more-tourists-than-local-people-visit-historical-places
156,Some parents think that childcare centres provide the best services for children of pre-school age. Other working parents think that family members such as grandparents will provide better care for their kids.,"While some parents believe that their children get the best care and support from playschools, others are of the opinion that grandparents are the best caretakers. I totally agree with the second view.
Grandparents take good care of their grandchildren because they love them. They are their flesh and blood and that is a good reason to shower them with love and care. Also, grandparents are much more than caretakers. Besides taking care of their grandchildren, they help the babies to develop their social and language skills. Moreover, the blood relationship between them help better bonding and create an overall healthy atmosphere, which in turn foster better growth and character formation. For Instance, a recent research found that babies who spend a considerable amount of time with their parents or grandparents learn things much faster.
As for playschools or day care centres, they are run for monetary benefits. The vast majority of these institutions are not all that concerned about the well-being of the kids. Many of them accommodate 20 to 25 kids at a time and that makes it difficult for them to attend to the needs of all children. The pre-school age is extremely crucial for the intellectual and emotional development of children. Since babies tend to learn a lot during this period, it is important for them to receive individual care and attention. Unfortunately, preschools and day care centres often fail to address these needs.
To conclude, in order to ensure the overall development of children, it is important to understand and acknowledge their needs like a grandparent or parent does. Since pre-schools are profit-driven I cannot agree with the argument that they provide the best service for preschool children.",9,band-9-essay-sample-grandparents-provide-better-care-than-day-care-centres
157,"“Although abuse of the system is inevitable, social welfare payments are essential to protect the rights citizens have to a guaranteed minimum income in a democratic society”
Discuss.","There are certain needs and expenses that we cannot do away with; therefore, I agree with the argument that a guaranteed minimum income is essential to protect the rights of all citizens in a democratic country.
In almost all nations the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. The poor and the marginalized sections of the society also have basic needs. They need food, clothing and shelter. They want to send their children to school. Since many of these people lack a proper livelihood, it is essential for the government to disburse welfare payments.
Of course, the welfare schemes are bound to be abused and there is no guarantee that the aid will always reach the needy. Even so, in my opinion, such schemes are required for the all round development of a country. Take, for instance, the case of India. Although the country has made rapid economic advancements over the last few decades, it still has millions of people living below the poverty line. India has robust welfare schemes for the poor. For example, the country’s public distribution system provides food grains and other essentials at highly subsidized rates for the poor. In fact, in many Indian states, poor families can get adequate amounts of rice or wheat for free. On the flip side, the poor are not the only beneficiaries of these schemes. In fact, millions of people living above the poverty line also receive the benefits by manipulating the system with the help of corrupt officials and politicians. As a result of this, the nation ends up spending a lot more money than it should for welfare schemes. However, abolishing welfare programmes is not the answer to this problem. If India pulls the plug on its public distribution system, thousands of people will die of hunger. So, the government continues the system in spite of knowing its limitations and with the help of new and improved technologies, the country is steadily removing ineligible people from its social benefit programs.
To conclude, just because welfare programmes are liable to be abused, it does not mean that the government should abolish them. With political will and the use of new technologies, it is possible to ensure that governmental aid reaches the right hands.

158,In some countries an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Incidences of obesity have risen over the years. It is believed to be a consequence of over consumption of fast food and hence some people argue that the government should increase the tax on such foods. In my opinion, this approach is unlikely to yield the desired result.
In the first place, increasing tax on fast food is unlikely to reduce its consumption. Actually, most people who consume it are already well aware of the health consequences of its consumption; however, their busy schedules do not permit them to cook proper meals at home. Hence, they opt for readymade meals. They will buy packaged food even if the price is high because they cannot or do not want to cook healthy food at home. Hence, a higher tax will have little impact on fast food consumption especially among middle and higher income groups. At the same time, it will put a burden on the lower strata of the society. Many of these people subsist on fast food because they cannot afford healthy food. By increasing the tax on fast food, the government will only add to their woes.
A better solution is to make healthy food more affordable and available to all sections of the society. The government can open eateries all over the country where it can sell healthy meals at affordable prices. It should also enact laws that make it mandatory for fast food companies to ensure the quality of their foods.
In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to combat obesity, and a higher tax on fast food is not the one we need. What the government should do is to make healthy meals more and more affordable.",9,band-9-essay-about-increasing-tax-on-fast-foods
159,"There seems to be an increasing number of serious crimes being committed each year. While some think that the best way is to use the death penalty as a deterrent, many people believe that other measures will be needed.","Over the years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of serious crimes being committed. While some people are of the opinion that capital punishment is the best way to tackle this problem, others disagree. In other opinion, other measures are required to reduce the crime rates. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in detail.
Capital punishment will certainly deter at least some people from committing heinous crimes. For example, a study in the US found that the rate of serious crimes in states that implement capital punishment is considerably lower than the crime rate in states that do not have capital punishment. This is clearly an indication that people are afraid of getting executed and that fear helps to reduce the crime rate.
However, capital punishment alone will not reduce the crime rates. If that was the case, then most countries should be free of serious crimes now because death penalty is still given in the majority of developed and developing countries. Therefore, the argument that other measures are also required to reduce crime certainly holds water.
One of the main reasons of increasing crime rates is the easy access to firearms. For example, many countries have liberal laws that allow almost everyone to own firearms. Crime rates are certainly high in countries like the United States in spite of the fact that they have an efficient penal system. If the US restricted the possession of guns, perhaps that alone would reduce the crime rates in that country. The government also needs to investigate the factors that compel people to commit crimes. In poor and developing nations poverty and unemployment are the main causes of increasing crime rates. If the government creates more jobs, the crime rate will automatically reduce.
In conclusion, there are several reasons behind increasing crime rates. Although some people insist that death penalty is the best way to tackle the problem, I agree with the argument that other measures are also required.",9,band-9-essay-sample-about-growing-crime-rates-and-capital-punishment
160,"Some people think that having a set retirement (e.g.65 years) for everybody, regardless of occupation, is unfair. They believe that certain workers deserve to retire and receive a pension at an earlier age.","These days, the topic of early retirement is much discussed. Some people believe that setting a fixed retirement age for all employees is unfair. In their opinion, people working in certain sectors should be allowed to retire early. I agree with that view.
To begin with, not all jobs are the same in terms of mental or physical demands. Certain jobs are more mentally or physically strenuous and people performing those jobs should receive early retirement. It will benefit the society as well as them. A recent study showed that people who work in physically and mentally demanding occupations might suffer from dementia if they continue working in the same occupation after turning fifty. If these people are not allowed to retire early they will become a burden on their company because of their low productivity.
There are also certain jobs that are better suited for youngsters than seniors. For example, driving a truck or waiting on tables requires greater levels of physical fitness. Such jobs are suited for young people. Likewise, aeroplane pilots also deserve early retirement because as they age their vision deteriorates and that could be a flight hazard. There are also certain jobs that no one wants to do. For example, few people are interested in cleaning sewage or collecting garbage. The government can encourage more people to take up such jobs by offering them early retirement. Lastly, firefighters also deserve early retirement because of their sacrifices and readiness to protect lives and also because their work is very demanding physically and mentally.
To conclude, I strongly agree that some workers should be entitled to an early retirement. While fixing the age of retirement for each occupation, the government should consider the demands of the job.",9,band-9-essay-sample-about-early-retirement
161,Nowadays we are producing more and more rubbish. Why do you think this is happening? What can governments do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced?,"The amount of rubbish produced by an average household has increased dramatically over the last few decades. There are several reasons behind this alarming development.
The first one, of course, is the improvement in living standards. Actually there is a significant increase in the number of households with disposable income. This increases consumption and unfortunately this also increases the production of rubbish. Earlier people used to cook food with the ingredients they sourced from their backyard. Now they buy packaged food from supermarkets. After the consumption of the food, this packaging will land in the trash bin and from there it will be transferred to landfills. Now when people feel thirsty, they just buy a bottle of water without worrying about the future of the empty bottle.
Another reason behind the excessive production of rubbish is the cheap availability of plastic. Using this versatile material it is now possible to produce almost any kind of wrappers and containers. Unfortunately, plastic is not biodegradable. Once it reaches the soil, it remains there for millions of years. Rubbish causes several health problems. It pollutes the air, water and soil. It affects the productivity of the soil.
The government and the public can take several measures to reduce the amount of rubbish they produce. People need to be aware that by producing more and more rubbish, they are hurting their health and the planet. The government needs to restrict the production of plastic. Hefty fines should be imposed on shops that offer plastic carry bags. It is also important to sensitise people about responsible consumption and the importance of reducing the production of rubbish.
To conclude, higher levels of income encourage people to consume more and as a consequence produce more waste. However, the government and the public can still save the planet from the frightening amount of rubbish by acting more responsibly.",9,band-9-essay-sample-we-are-producing-more-garbage-than-ever
162,Children do not respect their parents as much as they did in the past. This behaviour is now having a negative impact on society.,"The relationship between parents and children has undergone a drastic transformation over the last few decades. Parents are no longer the sole authority in a family. This change has certainly affected the way children interact with their parents. In fact, many of them have become disrespectful. Since they repeat the same behaviour outside of their home, it is having a negative effect on the society as well. There are several reasons behind this disturbing trend.
Today’s children receive much better education than what their parents received. They have also become smarter and more intelligent thanks to the accessibility of new age technologies. For example, I know many young children who can use their parents’ smart phones much better than them. They can drive vehicles faster. This creates a false sense of superiority and they often look down upon their parents and treat them with disrespect. This was not exactly the case thirty or forty years ago when the skill gap between parents and children were negligible.
Another factor that contributed to the growth of disrespectful children is the rise of the nuclear family. Most families now consist of just the parents and one or two kids. These families certainly revolve around these children and it is not uncommon for parents to cater to every whim and fancy of their kids. This makes children more demanding.
In my opinion, if children have become disrespectful, it is a problem with their upbringing. Parents who satisfy every need of their children are not doing them a service. Rather they are spoiling them. Parents are required to not only provide their children with food and clothing but also instill values in them. Today’s children may possess higher technical skills and more academic qualifications than their parents. This, however, does not mean that they are wiser.
To conclude, there is no denying the fact that children are becoming more disrespectful and this is having a negative impact on the society. However, in my opinion, this is actually a reflection of the poor parenting skills of their parents and the rise of the nuclear family.",9,band-9-essay-sample-children-do-not-respect-parents
163,"Some people think that the teenage years are the happiest of our lives, while others believe that adult life brings more happiness. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","People often wonder whether adolescence is better than adulthood. Some think so while others disagree. In my opinion, each stage in life has its pros and cons.
Adolescence is certainly an enjoyable period of time. Teens have few things to worry about. They are not required to earn money or support a family. As a result, many of them have plenty of free time that they can use to engage in activities they enjoy. Even the criminal law is kind to teenagers. Offences committed by teens attract less severe punishments than offences committed by adults. On the flip side, teenage is also a period of great emotional turmoil. Teens are neither kids nor adults and have a strong need for freedom. They do not like it when their parents or teachers attempt to make them behave.
By contrast, adults are more mature and responsible. Many of them have a job to meet their expenses. They have less free time than teens, but most of them simply do not care. They are more focused on their careers and want to achieve something in life. Since their family and the law treat them as mature individuals, they enjoy a greater level of freedom. For example, they can decide what they want to do with their life. They can choose a job of their liking or they can choose not to work at all. While teens are minors adults are majors capable of entering into contracts enforceable by the law.
After looking at both sides of the situation, it is not hard to see that adolescence and adulthood have their upsides and downsides. In my opinion, it is therefore wrong to claim that one stage of life is better or happier than another stage.

Most of them are driven by a passion to achieve something that few others have been able to achieve. They want to experience the adrenalin rush that such expeditions bring on.
Travelling to difficult places has both advantages and disadvantages. One of the biggest benefits of undertaking difficult journeys is that they improve one’s confidence in one’s abilities. While the journey can be physically and mentally exhausting, the exhilaration that one experiences upon its successful completion is not something that can be described in mere words. It is this need to test one’s limits that propelled sailors like Magellan and Columbus to sail around the world and discover unknown lands. It is this need to conquer the unknown that encourages people to climb mountains. And there are many takers for this trend. Adventure tourism is growing by leaps and bounds. People are aware of the risks, yet they want to experience the thrill. So, they set out on difficult journeys.
On the flip side, difficult journeys can be extremely dangerous. Things can go against our plans. Lots of travellers have died while trekking difficult mountains or rafting in turbulent rivers. There are also many adventure travellers who sustain serious injuries that leave them immobile for the rest of their lives. Another drawback of such journeys is that if the travellers go missing or find themselves in trouble, the governments may have to launch costly rescue operations.
To conclude, difficult journeys are extremely thrilling. They are equally dangerous; yet many people undertake them because they want to test their limits and conquer the unknown.

While some people believe that we should spend our money to enjoy life, others argue that we should save it for future. I agree with the latter point of view.
There are people who believe that life is supposed to be enjoyable and full of happiness. In their opinion, if you just work hard to save more money for your future, you will not be able to enjoy your life. No one, after all, gets a second life to enjoy the goodies they give up in their quest to save more and more. This argument certainly sounds convincing; however, there is another side to it.
I have absolutely no issues with people who believe that life should be enjoyed to the fullest. But in order to enjoy life, we also need to be prepared to handle its ups and downs. It is almost impossible to predict what will happen in the future. For example, a critical illness, an accident or a loss of job can land us in serious trouble and derail the course of our life. If we spend all our money to enjoy our current life, we will not be able to deal with these situations.
To conclude, life is full of surprises and it is impossible to predict what will happen tomorrow. Therefore, we need to be prepared and the most practical way of doing this is to save money for the future. This does not mean that we should not spend money at all.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Celebrities such as film stars and sportspersons support several charitable organizations. Some people argue that they are doing this to gain more publicity. I don’t quite agree with this view. Celebrities are certainly interested in hogging the limelight and that may be the reason they get involved in charitable work. Even so, by openly supporting various humanitarian causes, they are also creating awareness and encouraging other people to get involved.
In my opinion, the argument that celebrities reduce the importance of problems does not hold water. They bring issues to public attention by lending their support to them. For example, countless celebrities endorse Green Peace and PETA. By doing so, they have created awareness about the need to protect the planet and wildlife. I doubt that PETA would have gained so much attention without the active support of celebrities.
Of course, celebrities do not do much other than just lending their support. But because of their popularity, the media follow them wherever they go and when they get involved in a cause, that makes headlines. This encourages the fans of these celebrities to also support those causes. This is how celebrities make a difference to the world. Because of their huge fan following they can encourage people to act by simply voicing their support for an organization or a cause. It does not really matter whether they are doing this for their own benefits or for the benefit of the charity.
In conclusion, I do not agree with the argument that celebrities belittle the importance of various humanitarian causes. They may be supporting charities for their own benefits, but by doing so they are also bringing these causes to the fore and getting the support of others.",9,band-9-essay-sample-celebrities-support-charitable-causes-for-their-own-benefits

Discuss this view and give your own opinion.","While it is true that there has been some path-breaking research in education, academic achievements are still assessed using the old fashioned ‘pen and paper’ exams. Many people believe that this is a flawed method. I don’t fully agree with them.
Paper based written examinations have their flaws. The biggest problem with the traditional examinations is that they only assess the performance of the student on the day of the exam. As a result a bright student who couldn’t prepare well for the exam due to reasons that were beyond their control will get a poor grade. This is unfair. If the student performed well throughout the year in class tests and other informal assessments, there is no justification for giving them a poor grade just because they failed to perform well in one examination. Written examinations also encourage mugging. Parents and teachers force students to learn answers by heart with the sole objective of getting a good score. Many of these students don’t understand the concepts and yet they get good marks. They won’t be able to answer the same questions if you ask them a few days later. This kind of learning will benefit neither the student nor the society.
An alternative solution is to use a method of continuous evaluation. Schools should monitor the performance of students from day one. They should also use a variety of parameters to determine the merit of each student. Unfortunately, this method also has its flaws. In most cases, teachers and schools try to manipulate the results with the objective of getting great results for their school. Education is a highly competitive sector and every school wants to get better results than other schools. So in this scenario if schools are entrusted with the task of grading their students, we cannot expect the results to be impartial.
Perhaps a better solution is to use written examinations in tandem with continuous evaluation. This will ensure that good students will get the grades they deserve even if they fail to perform well on exam day.
To conclude, the traditional written examination has its flaws. Other methods have their flaws too.

168,"Nowadays, many families have both parents working. Some working parents believe that other family members can take care of their children, while others think childcare centers are better. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The cost of living has increased and hence in many families now both parents work. One of the biggest problems that working parents face is finding an appropriate support system for their children. Some get the help of their parents or other close relatives. Others send their children to daycare centres. In my opinion, both options have their pros and cons. Even so, I am in favour of leaving the children in the care of other family members if that is possible.
In countries like India most people prefer to leave their children in the care of their grandparents. The biggest advantage of this arrangement is that the children will get lots of love and care from their grandparents. They will also learn family values and moral principles. This will ensure their proper emotional and physical development. What’s more, grandparents have previous experience in parenting. So they know how children should be taken care of. On the flip side, grandparents are also known to be overindulgent. They often turn a blind eye to the faults of their grandchildren. As a result children can grow into spoilt brats but parental intervention at the right stages can prevent this from happening.
Sending the kids to daycare centres has its ups and downs too. In a daycare centre the child will have the company of several other children. This opportunity to interact with others will improve their communication skills. Some daycare centres also act as playschools that teach kids numbers and alphabets. On the flip side, the caretakers at these childcare centres have no emotional attachment to the children. They may have degrees in child psychology but they cannot give the love or attention that parents or grandparents can give. What’s more, many of these centres are actually profit driven and often fail to take good care of children.
To conclude, after looking at the pros and cons of both arrangements it is not hard to see that leaving children in the care of their grandparents is a better option than sending them to childcare centres.

169,"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
What is your opinion?","Some jobs are already done by robots. However, I do not believe that all jobs will eventually be performed by such devices for several reasons. Robots are expensive and incapable of doing certain jobs that require special skills. Government regulations will also prevent their large scale deployment.
If a man can do a job as well as a robot, I see no justification for replacing the man with a robot. Robots are suitable for certain jobs, but they have plenty of limitations too. To begin with, the cost of operating and maintaining robots is extremely high. This is a great reason for employers to continue to prefer humans over robots. For example, the cost of installing a robot in a Khartoum-based supermarket was around one million U.S. dollars. The robot will require decades to deliver services worth its cost. Furthermore, in order to keep these devices working continuously, companies will have to employ skilled operators. This will further increase their cost of operation and make human workers indispensable in the labour market.
There are also certain jobs that require the human touch. For instance, robots cannot do a good job in sectors like medicine, engineering or social service because of their inability to understand human feelings, needs and wants. Unemployment is another factor that discourages the deployment of robots on a large scale. If robots are deployed in all sectors people will lose their jobs. As we already know, unemployment has an adverse effect on the society. To prevent this situation, the government may also bring about legislation that requires companies to employ humans instead of robots.
To sum up, robots may be getting smarter; however, in my opinion, they will never completely replace humans in the workplace. Of course, there are sectors where only robots can be employed. In other sectors, humans will continue to be employed.",9,band-9-essay-sample-eventually-all-jobs-will-be-done-by-robots

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Electronic gadgets like mobile phones or computers have become an integral part of our lives and it is now impossible to imagine a life without them. Some people, however, argue that the overuse of these devices has an adverse effect on the language skills of young people. I partially agree with this view.
Nowadays most students spend a great deal of time on their tablets and smart phones. They have become addicted to these devices. Since these devices are small, they only have a small keypad to type in messages. So most youngsters now only use acronyms when they send messages to their friends. Worse, they find the SMS lingo quite ‘cool’. As a result, many of them don’t know the spelling of even common words. In addition, they use smileys and stickers to express their emotions. While this might look harmless, it can actually affect their ability to communicate feelings in words. What’s more, most word processors now have spell-checkers. Since these programs automatically correct the spelling of misspelled words, students don’t even have to learn spelling to get good marks in their exams.
On the flip side, digital equipments can also improve the reading and writing skills of youngsters. There are numerous websites and mobile applications that allow students to learn and improve their language skills. Dictionary apps are particularly helpful for finding the origin and pronunciation of words. Devices like e-book readers actually develop reading habits amongst youngsters. Thanks to their compact size we can carry them around and read whenever we want to.
To conclude, modern devices like mobile phones or tablets have positive and negative aspects in equal measures. It is up to us to decide whether we want to benefit from them or allow them to destroy our language and cognitive skills.

171,"Some people think that schools should reward students who have the best academic results, while others believe that it is more important to reward students who show progress. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Most schools reward students who perform well in their examinations. Some people, however, feel that instead of giving prizes to academic toppers, schools should appreciate the hard work of students who show great progress by rewarding them. In my opinion, toppers as well as those who show progress need to be rewarded.
Rewards motivate students to work harder and achieve better results. Everybody loves to get prizes. Toppers are no different. When the school appreciates their hard work with prizes, they will be motivated to work even harder. What’s more, their performance will also inspire other students to study harder and improve their grades. If the school does not reward them, at least, some of them will lose the motivation and that may reflect in their grades.
At the same time, toppers are not the only students who need to be appreciated. Students who show great progress should also be rewarded for their hard work. Just knowing that the school appreciates their efforts will be a motivation for them and they will want to improve their performance by working harder.
Rewards are given for a reason. As human beings, we all crave appreciation. When others recognize our efforts, we will want to work even harder and achieve greater results. If schools only reward academic toppers, others may assume that prizes are not meant for them. In that case, they will give up even without making an effort to get better grades. If, on the other hand, the schools also reward students showing improvement, more and more students will want to improve their grades.
To conclude, rewards encourage all students to work harder. Therefore, in my opinion, not only the toppers, but students showing improvement also need to be rewarded.

172,Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their own countries. What are the reasons?  What are the solutions to change negative attitudes?,"Some people are not in favour of foreigners visiting their country. They feel that international tourists do more harm than good to their culture. In my opinion, this negative attitude is the outcome of various misconceptions about foreigners. The government and the media can do a lot to bust these myths.
Cultural differences exist between nations and that is the reason behind this animosity towards foreign tourists. People, especially those living in conservative societies, believe that the influx of foreign tourists to their country can damage their ethnic culture and values. India, for example, is a conservative country that expects both men and women to dress modestly and behave conservatively in public. When western tourists, especially women, wear skimpy outfits while touring the country, they invite a lot of unwanted stares. The same thing happens in Arabian countries where public display of affection is strictly forbidden. Obviously, Arabians do not like it when foreigners kiss or engage in other acts of affection in public.
While it is true that no culture is better or worse than others, countries should still advise their people to dress and behave appropriately when they are abroad. Foreigners need to realize that when they disrespect local customs and traditions, they are putting their safety at risk. Host nations should also convince their people that tourism is actually good for their country and economy. It creates jobs and boosts local economy.
To conclude, misconceptions about foreigners are the reason many people dislike them. International tourists can do a lot to dispel these myths by behaving appropriately and respecting foreign cultures and customs when they are abroad. The governments of host nations should also convince their people of the importance of tourism.",9,band-9-essay-sample-some-people-think-international-tourism-is-bad-for-their-country
173,Everyone should follow a vegetarian diet because it is not necessary to eat meat to be healthy.,"When it is perfectly possible to lead a healthy life by eating plant based foods, I see no justification for killing birds or animals for our food. Therefore, I completely agree with the argument that everyone should adopt a vegetarian diet.
There are several benefits to following a vegetarian diet. To start with, plant based foods are rich in vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants and other nutrients required for good health. What’s more, most fruits and vegetables contain little or no cholesterol or calories. Research has shown that vegetarians are less likely to develop health problems like obesity, cancer or heart trouble. Health benefits are not the only reason to follow a vegetarian diet. When we obtain our food from plants, we can also stop cruelty to animals.
By contrast, non-vegetarian foods such as fish and meat are high in cholesterol, fat and calories. Regular consumption of red meat is known to increase a person’s risk of cancer and heart disease. In addition, unlike fruits or vegetables, fish and meat cannot be eaten raw. The slaughtered animal may have some illness. If half-cooked meat is eaten, it can cause deadly infections in human beings. In fact many cases of food poisoning are caused by the consumption of contaminated meat.
The quality of non-vegetarian food has also deteriorated over the years. Seafood has become contaminated due to the pollution of ocean water. It is a well-known fact that farm animals are given steroids to grow rapidly. When we eat their meat, the steroid also enters our body. This leads to several problems like precocious puberty in children.
To conclude, vegetarian foods are healthy and do not constitute cruelty to animals. Therefore, I believe that everyone should adopt vegetarianism.",9,band-9-essay-sample-everyone-should-adopt-vegetarianism
174,"Studies show that many criminals do not receive enough education. For this reason, people believe that the best ways to reduce crime is to educate them so they can find a job after being released. Do you agree or disagree?","Lack of education and employment opportunities are the main causes of the rising crime rate. Some people, therefore, feel that by simply educating prisoners, we can discourage them from committing crimes again after they get released from prison. I totally agree with this view.
Almost nobody is born a criminal. Most criminals are victims of circumstances. In fact most of them come from the poor strata of the society and lack education. As a result they don’t have many employment opportunities. Many of them eventually become thieves or gangsters. By contrast, criminal tendencies are comparatively low among educated people.
Educating convicted criminals in prison will certainly not erase their shoddy past. However, it improves their chances of finding employment once they get released. One of the biggest problems that ex-prisoners face is the lack of rehabilitation opportunities. The society prefers to keep them at an arm’s length and as such they have fewer opportunities for making a living once they complete their sentence. Unfortunately, this increases their chances of getting into crime again.
Education may change the situation for good. If prisoners receive an opportunity to learn and acquire vocational or academic degrees from prison, they are more likely to find employment upon their release. When they have a secure job and a means of living, most people will not want to get into crime again.
To conclude, education improves a person’s employability. Just because someone is a prisoner, it does not mean that they cannot learn or acquire degrees. In fact, educating prisoners is one of the best things we can do for their rehabilitation and successful induction into the society.

175,"Some people think that in order to prevent illness and disease, governments should try to reduce environmental pollution and housing problems.","Pollution and poverty are important causes of illnesses. Some people, therefore, feel that the governments should take measures to tackle these evils. I completely agree with this view.
Many governments already earmark a considerable percentage of their annual budget to healthcare. If a fraction of that is spent on providing housing and improving air quality, the governments can prevent people from falling ill in the first place.
Millions of people still live in unhygienic surroundings. They cannot afford a home because of poverty. Unhealthy surroundings are the breeding ground of bacteria, mosquitoes and flies. Since these are the carriers of illnesses people living in slums and poor surroundings fall ill quite often. If the government provides affordable housing to all, the living standards of millions of people in the developing countries will improve substantially. As a result, their health will also improve.
Pollution is another silent killer. Due to environmental pollution the quality of air, water and soil has decreased causing various illnesses in people. For example, respiratory illnesses are quite common among people living in cities because of the poor quality of air in urban areas. Water pollution causes illnesses like typhoid, jaundice and dysentery. While these diseases can affect anyone, people living in dirty surroundings are more likely to be affected by them.
To conclude, if the governments are really keen on improving the health of their citizens, they must address the real cause of diseases. In other words by simply making housing affordable for all and controlling air pollution, the government can protect its people from illnesses. Prevention, after all, is better than cure.",9,band-9-essay-sample-government-should-reduce-pollution-and-improve-housing-to-prevent-people-from-falling-ill
176,Scientists agree that people are harming their health by eating too much fat food. Some people think that the solution to this problem is to make people aware of the problems. Others think education will not work. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Excessive consumption of fatty foods leads to a lot of health problems. Some people believe that creating awareness about the health consequences of junk food is the solution to this problem. Others, however, feel that other measures are required to tackle this issue. In my opinion, creating awareness is important but that alone will not work.
Most people lead a hectic life these days. They do not have the time or energy to cook proper meals. As a result, they subsist on fast food. Many of them are actually aware of the ill effects of fast food; yet they consume it because they prefer convenience to health. Such people will not stop eating junk foods even if the government launches awareness campaigns against such foods. There are also some people who consume fast food because they are ignorant of the consequences of fast food consumption. Awareness campaigns will work best amongst them.
As we have seen, in many cases lack of awareness is not the factor that encourages the consumption of fast foods. Therefore other actions are also required to deal with this problem. People who eat fast food in spite of knowing that it is unhealthy may stop eating it if the government makes it unaffordable by increasing taxes on it. Even this measure will not deter wealthy people from consuming fast foods. Perhaps a better solution is to make healthy food more affordable and accessible. The government can perhaps open eateries that serve healthy food at reasonable prices. In Tamil Nadu, for example, there are state funded canteens that serve healthy foods for a nominal price. When healthy options are available conveniently at least some people will give up fast food.
To conclude, creating awareness about the harmful effects of fast foods is certainly important but it will not solve the problem. In addition to creating awareness, the government has to take measures that make fast foods unaffordable and healthy foods more accessible.

177,Whether someone achieves their goal or not is a question of luck. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"When someone succeeds, people often attribute that to luck. While I admit that luck may have a role to play here, I don’t know anyone who achieved success only because of luck. Therefore, I disagree with the argument that success or failure is a matter of good or bad luck.
If we look around it is not hard to see that most people who achieved success in life had faced many hardships in their early life. Apple INC’s Steve Jobs, for example, was given up for adoption immediately after he was born. He faced hardships in his early life but went on to found one of the most enduring businesses in the world. Steve Jobs never attributed his success to luck. Neither did Bill Gates, the richest man in the world. They were visionaries who toiled hard to win their goals.
Helen Keller, whose story continues to inspire millions of people even today, didn’t even have many faculties that we take for granted. She could neither hear nor speak but none of these disabilities prevented her from achieving what she wanted in life. There are several such examples of people who fought against all odds to achieve their goals. Many of them came from backgrounds that we consider unlucky. Still through determination, dedication and hard work they were able to achieve success, fame and money.
Of course, there are a few people who achieved success because of good luck. Children born to rich and famous parents, for example, do not have to struggle to become famous or rich. We can perhaps attribute their success to luck but in reality such success does not last long.
To conclude, if a person is determined to succeed nothing, not even bad luck, can prevent them from achieving what they want. Fortune, after all, favours the brave.",9,band-9-essay-sample-success-is-a-matter-of-luck
178,"Some believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.","There are arguments both in favour of and against giving homework to students. While some people believe that homework is beneficial to children, others argue that it is an unwanted burden on them. In my opinion, a small amount of homework will help students to improve their grades; however, I am against giving too much homework.
The biggest advantage of homework is that it encourages students to open their books and revise their lessons after reaching home. And if they do their homework with concentration, they will also learn the lessons. This will definitely improve their grades. If teachers do not give homework, most students will simply waste their time after reaching home playing video games or chatting with their friends. They will have to work doubly hard when exams draw closer. By encouraging students to learn the lessons the day they are taught, homework helps them improve their grades.
On the other hand, homework can also be an unwanted burden. Most students spend a lot of time in the classroom. They are already tired by the time they reach home and lack the motivation to complete their homework. If they do homework it is for fear of punishment. When children are forced to do homework, they are less likely to focus on what they are doing. They may just copy answers from their notebook. This practice will not benefit them in any way.
This, however, does not mean that teachers should stop giving homework. They can make homework less of a burden by giving only a small amount of it. This way they can ensure that students have time for play as well. Studies have shown that physical activity also helps brain development and boosts grades indirectly.
To conclude, the practice of giving too much homework should definitely be discouraged as it is unhealthy and useless. However, abolishing homework is not the solution. Instead of taking such drastic measures, in my opinion, teachers should just reduce the amount of homework they give.",9,band-9-essay-sample-teachers-should-stop-giving-homework
179,"Most employers do job interviews before offering a position to a person. Do you think this is the best way to do it, or are there better alternatives? What is the best method of choosing employees in your opinion?","It is a common practice all over the world for employers to interview potential candidates. While I don’t think that this is the best way to assess the job worthiness of a particular candidate, I cannot suggest any better alternatives. In my opinion, combining the interview with mock practical tests and written examinations is the best way of finding suitable candidates.
Interviews certainly are useful in many ways. The fact that they are used all over the world is a clear sign that a lot of employers find them useful. During an interview, the employer can assess the personality of a candidate to a great extent. Also there are various techniques that the interviewers can use to find out how a particular person will behave in various situations. Interviews are particularly helpful for selecting employees whose jobs require them to interact a lot with potential clients and customers. For example, people working in sales, marketing, PR or HR need good people skills that can be measured during an interview.
Perhaps the biggest downside of interviews is that the candidates can come prepared and turn the interview to their advantage. It is possible to give learned answers to questions asked during an interview. In addition, it is foolish to believe that all candidates will demonstrate their true nature or work ethics during an interview.
Another disadvantage of interviews is that by interviewing someone, an employer can only assess their personality and general knowledge. An interview, for example, is not a good way of measuring a person’s technical skills. By simply interviewing someone who has a degree in engineering, an employer cannot find out whether they have the skills required to deliver a good performance at the workplace. In such situations putting the candidate through tasks they would have to typically do before offering them a job is a better solution.
To conclude, while it is true that an interview is not the best method of choosing a candidate, there aren’t many better alternatives. In my opinion, employers should combine the interview with written tests and mock practical tests to find the most suitable employees.

180,Most high-level positions in companies are filled by men even though the workforce in many developed countries is more than 50 percent female. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percent of these positions to women.,"In many companies most of the senior level positions are occupied by men. Since many of these companies have an equal number of male and female employees, some people feel that this is unfair. In their opinion, companies should reserve a certain number of managerial positions for women. I both agree and disagree with this view.
There are many reasons why I believe that companies should reserve jobs for women. First of all, women should have the same opportunities as men. Ensuring gender equality in the workplace is the easiest way to avoid gender based discrimination. Also when an equal number of men and women work at senior levels, it will make the work environment pleasant for both genders. What’s more, sometimes just knowing that a certain percent of higher positions are reserved for women can actually be an inspiration for female employees to work hard. Women also have certain qualities that make them good managers. For example, they are better at communicating and solving problems.
On the flip side, reserving positions can have its fair share of disadvantages too. Companies are driven by profits and they need employees who have the skills, expertise and knowledge to take their business forward. If a certain number of senior positions are reserved for women, then companies will be required to appoint only women in those positions. This can actually pose a problem if there aren’t suitable female candidates. If companies are forced to appoint less qualified candidates, it will have a negative impact on their bottom line.
To conclude, companies should strive to achieve gender equality at the workplace. However, I feel that reserving senior management positions for women is not very practical.",9,band-9-essay-sample-some-managerial-positions-should-be-reserved-for-female-employees
181,"In order to reduce crime, some argue that attacking its cause like poverty is the best solution, while others believe that putting more people in prisons and having more policemen are more convenient way in tackling crime. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Reducing the crime rate is crucial to ensuring the safety and security of people living in a particular society. While some people are in favour of building more prisons and increasing the number of policemen, others feel that achieving economic welfare is the key to tackling crime. In my opinion, all of these measures are required to fight crime effectively.
There are several benefits to increasing the number of policemen patrolling the streets. They will act as a deterrent and force offenders to think twice before engaging in robbery or shoplifting. They will also increase the sense of safety among law-abiding citizens. It is equally important to punish those engaging in criminal activities. They are a threat to the life and property of people and hence they should be kept in confinement. The hardships that they face in the prison and the subsequent social alienation may reform at least some of them.
Perhaps a better solution to reduce the crime rates is to ensure financial security for everyone. Studies have shown that most criminals have poor financial backgrounds. In most cases, it is their poverty that compels them to commit criminal deeds. If the government can create more jobs and provide economic security for all the people, the crime rates will automatically drop. Of course, this will require the government to invest more in education and vocational training. Educated and trained people will be able to create jobs themselves. They are also less likely to get into crime.
To conclude, tackling crime is a tough task and the government has to employ all possible means to achieve this. This will involve deploying more policemen on the streets, putting criminals behind the bars and ensuring economic security for all the people.",9,band-9-essay-sample-eliminating-poverty-is-the-best-way-to-reduce-crime-rates
182,Information technology enables many people to do their work outside their workplace. Do the benefits of this mobility outweigh the disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Technology has significantly changed the way we live and work. For instance it has allowed many of us to have flexible work hours. When we can have our data available in a cloud, we can work pretty much from anywhere in the world. Some people believe that this flexibility improves the quality of our life and work. However, in my opinion, working from home has both benefits and drawbacks.
One of the most important benefits of working from home is the ability to spend more time with our loved ones. Some people argue that this will boost the morale of employees and encourage them to give their best. Remote working also benefits parents of very young children. A lot of women quit their jobs to take care of their children. If companies allow them to work from their home, they can join the workforce again. Companies also benefit when employees work from their home. They can save money on office rentals and utility bills.
On the flip side, remote working has its drawbacks too. Some people believe that having a nice workplace where people can work together as a team and communicate closely is more beneficial than working from outside. I have a personal example on how distance can interfere with work outcomes. My boss travels a lot and sometimes I have a hard time meeting him. Once he asked me to prepare a presentation for a meeting we were going to have. As I started to work on it, I found out that I had some questions and I couldn´t reach him to clarify my doubts. I finished my work and then weeks later, when he got back, I showed him my presentation and it was not what he wanted. As a result, I had to do it again, which was a waste of time.
To conclude, there are both benefits and drawbacks to working from home. Flexible hours or freelancing is not for everyone; however, there are lots of employees who benefit from it.

183,Nowadays children spend more time playing computer games than doing sports. Why is it happening? Does it have a positive or negative effect on their development?,"Physical activity plays an important role in the physical and psychological development of children during the initial years of their life. However, urbanization and modernization have replaced outdoor games with indoor games and thus increased the number of couch potatoes among the current generation. In my view this is a negative development that affects the physical and mental development of children.
Firstly, urbanization eliminated public playgrounds from cities and towns. Thanks to the development of all those housing complexes and shopping centres the cities have become more congested than ever leaving no room for little ones to enjoy outdoor games like cricket or football. Since playing such sports in narrow streets cause disturbance to apartment dwellers parents are forced to keep their children indoors.
The security of children has also become a cause for concern. Parents are becoming wary of letting their children play outside. So, to keep them engaged indoors they equip their children with video games, computers and smart phones. As a result, children are getting detached from the benefits of playing outside. This, unfortunately, affects their physical and intellectual development. Sitting in front of a computer or gaming console for long hours can affect the eyesight of children and make them obese.
Studies have shown that physical activity helps the development of cognitive abilities like decision-making and problem-solving. Sports and games also teach children crucial life skills such as team spirit and the ability to take success and failure alike. When children do not engage in sports, they are losing an opportunity to master these life lessons.
To conclude, video games might keep children engaged for hours on end, but they do not help the overall development of children. So I strongly believe that spending too much time on playing computer games can be very harmful for the upcoming generation.

184,Essay,"Nowadays a lot of people feel that they are always in danger irrespective of their physical location. They don’t feel safe at home or in public places. This essay will explore the various reasons behind this troubling phenomenon and suggest measures to tackle it.
There are several factors that make people feel insecure. Firstly, both visual and print media give excessive coverage to violent crimes and encourage people to worry about their safety. News channels report sensational crimes to increase their viewership and ratings. It is quite natural for someone who is constantly exposed to violent images of terror in public spaces to be concerned about their own safety.
Secondly, due to global warming and other climate changes natural disasters now occur more and more frequently making people feel unsafe even at home. Clearly, people across the globe are experiencing extreme weather conditions such as flooding and droughts more often. Since we cannot protect ourselves from most natural disasters by staying indoors, the fear of dangerous weather conditions keeps growing among people.
In order to tackle this problem, the governments, media and people should work together. The governments can deploy more police forces on streets to deter criminals from committing crime. Individuals who are worried about their safety should try not to expose themselves to too much violent content on the TV or the internet. By carefully choosing what to watch on TV they can reduce their exposure to violent crimes and at the same time increase their feeling of safety. In addition, planning for natural disasters by taking appropriate safety measures and precautions can help allay the concerns of the public.
In conclusion, I suggest that governments and individuals tackle the feelings of insecurity among the public by working together to reduce crime rates and preparing for unexpected natural events.",9,band-9-essay-sample-people-are-not-feeling-safe-at-home-or-in-public-places

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Whether building more sport facilities and gyms is the best way to improve public health is debatable. In my opinion, it is important to build more sports centers but the government needs to take other measures too.
There is no denying the fact that playing sports and games improves one’s physical and mental health. When we engage ourselves in a sport, the circulation of blood through our body improves ensuring that every cell gets adequate oxygen. Sports and games also improve our mental health and intellectual skills. According to a famous Persian proverb, wisdom can only be found in a healthy body. Obviously if the body is not healthy, the mind cannot be healthy either. Lack of adequate facilities is one of the reasons that prevent people from playing sports. By building more sports facilities in towns and villages we can encourage more and more people to get physically active.
On the flip side, there is very little we can achieve by simply increasing the number of sports clubs and gyms. Nutrition is as important as physical activity. If people do not eat right they will not be healthy even if they spend hours in the gym. Studies after studies have shown that unhealthy eating habits are on the rise among young people. There are also lots of people who cannot afford healthy food. They will not gain much from building more sports facilities. I am not saying that the government should not build more gyms or sports centers. However, in my opinion, ensuring that everyone can afford healthy food and creating awareness about the importance of eating right are more important.
To conclude, while it is true that sports centers play an important role in improving public health, claiming that building more of them is the best way to achieve public health is a mistake. I am not against the government building more sports facilities; however, in my opinion, authorities must also ensure that everyone can afford nutritious food.",9,building-more-sports-facilities-is-the-best-way-to-improve-public-health-ielts-essay-sample
186,Some people think that children should learn to paint or draw at school. Others believe it is just a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"A lot of schools teach subjects like painting and drawing. While some people are in favour of this, others feel that teaching such subjects is merely a waste of time. I agree with them. In my opinion, a student’s time can be used for better purposes.
I certainly agree that there are at least a few benefits to learning arts. For example, activities like drawing or painting enhances the creativity of children. Arts give wings to their imagination and broaden their horizons. Another benefit is that arts help children to become better individuals in life. In addition, these subjects offer plenty of relaxation. Being engaged in such creative activities help students to break the monotony of studying academics.
On the flip side, art subjects cannot be made compulsory because not everybody has an aptitude for drawing, painting or singing. Since these subjects require inborn talents, there is no point in imposing them on students who may not have an aptitude for them. For example, some students may be more interested in playing sports. They will not enjoy it if the school forces them to sit and draw. It will be more rewarding for them to invest their time in playing games. What’s more, for most parents, the motive for sending their children to school is to help them excel in academics. They want the school to focus on subjects like mathematics or science. As for those students who are actually interested in learning art, well, they can learn it from classes outside school. In every city, town and village, there are several institutions teaching subjects like singing, dancing and drawing.
To conclude, I feel that schools should not make drawing or painting compulsory. Instead, they should offer it as an optional subject so that students who are actually interested in it can pursue it without wasting the time of others.",9,band-9-essay-sample-subjects-like-drawing-and-painting-are-a-waste-of-time

To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"Traditional school curriculum gives too much importance to subjects like history or arts. Some people oppose this. In their opinion, schools should teach subjects that will improve the employability of their students. I totally agree with this view.
History is important. After all, there is no point in developing a generation of professionals who know absolutely nothing about their culture or history. However, problems arise when traditional subjects get more importance than job-oriented subjects. Learning subjects like history or literature might make a person more knowledgeable; however, these subjects do not improve the job worthiness of a student. Employers need professional degrees. It is not easy to find a job after obtaining a degree in history or arts. This is not exactly the case with science or maths graduates. Since they possess the skills required by the industry, they find jobs easily.
Everyone wants to be able to find a good job after finishing their studies. When the schools give more importance to professional or vocational subjects, students can start learning the skills required by the industry from a young age. This will improve their competence.
Unemployment figures are increasing rapidly all over the world. If we examine the unemployment situation in any country, it is not hard to see that most of the unemployed are students who lack a professional degree. When schools give more importance to subjects like maths or science, more and more students will want to enrol in professional courses when they go to university and such courses will enable them to find jobs easily.
To conclude, subjects like history or literature are important, but maths and science are even more important. After all, the ultimate goal of education is helping students to find employment. Therefore, I totally agree with the argument that schools should focus on teaching the skills that will prepare their students for the workplace.

188,Some people say that companies who sponsor big games can gain a lot; other people believe that it has disadvantages for them. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"While some people believe that companies can reap rich benefits by sponsoring major sporting events, others contest that claim. In their opinion, the sponsorship of major events can sometimes have detrimental effects on a company. In this essay, I will examine both arguments and express my opinion.
Major sporting events are watched by billions of people all over the world. By simply getting associated with an event like Olympics or World Cup Football, a company can increase its brand value, sales and revenue. For instance, back in the 70s when the Olympics was sponsored by Coca-Cola its market share reportedly went from 20 percent to 40 percent in the US. Today Coca-Cola is a household name and much of that publicity came from the sponsorship of major events.
Sometimes, however, the sponsorship of an event can earn bad publicity for the company. This can happen when the event or the players get embroiled in various controversies. For example, in the 1990s when a cricket tournament was held between India and Pakistan, there was a massive fight between the players of the two countries.  This earned a lot of bad publicity for not only the tournament but also its sponsor Nike. In the aftermath of this ugly incident Nike’s sales reportedly decreased by 10 percent in both India and Pakistan.
After analysing both sides of the situation, it is not hard to see that sponsoring a major sporting event can sometimes earn bad publicity for a company. However, such incidents are very rare. Since a company can become a household name by simply associating itself with a major event like Olympics or World Cup Football, I strongly believe that the benefits of sponsoring such events outweigh the disadvantages if any.

Others argue that leading a healthy lifestyle is the responsibility of the people. In my opinion, both the government and the individuals have an important role in ensuring the health of a nation.
The government can do a lot of things to improve the health of its citizens. For example, it can build swimming pools and parks with jogging tracks to encourage people to exercise and stay healthy. It could perhaps charge a nominal membership fee for the maintenance of these facilities. Physical activity helps people lose weight and improves their cardiovascular health. In addition, the government can impose extra taxes on junk foods and other unhealthy habits. It can also promote a healthy lifestyle through educational programs on television, radio and newspapers.
The individuals are equally responsible for their health. No matter how hard the government tries, if someone does not want to be healthy, the government can offer little help. In many countries obesity has become a major health issue. Poor eating habits and the lack physical activity are the major reasons behind us. The government could perhaps increase the tax on junk foods but the wealthy will still be able to afford them. This clearly shows that the government alone cannot improve the health of people. We are also responsible. Every one of us has to make a conscious effort to stay away from unhealthy habits. For example, we need to eliminate junk foods from our platters and quit habits like smoking or drinking.
To conclude, both parties – the government and the individuals – are responsible for maintaining a healthy nation and people.",9,ielts-essay-about-government-taking-measures-to-improve-peoples-health
190,"Some people say that cities are a better place for children to grow up, while others believe countryside is the right choice. Discuss both views.","People have different views regarding where children should be raised. While some believe that they should be brought up in the cities others argue that the countryside is the best place to raise young children. In my opinion, both cities and villages have their merits and demerits.
Health benefits are the biggest advantage of raising children in the countryside. Rural areas are less polluted than urban areas. They are more beautiful and may inspire the imagination of kids. Also they are safer with fewer instances of crime. In addition rural communities are closer and people know one another. All of these help the physical, emotional and social development of children. In fact, children who grow up in the countryside tend to have a better connection with nature and their fellow beings.
On the flip side, urban areas have their merits too. Children living in cities have easy access to better schools and colleges. Actually, this is the main reason for many parents to raise their children in cities. This is not exactly the case with village children. They often have to travel to cities to obtain quality education. In addition, finding a job after completing studies is easier in a city than in a village.
To conclude, neither the urban areas nor the rural areas are a perfect place to bring up children. They both have their advantages and disadvantages. Cities are a better choice for parents who are more concerned about giving the best possible education to their children. Villages are ideal for gifting them a healthy and carefree childhood.",9,ielts-essay-about-raising-children-in-rural-and-urban-areas
191,"In some developing countries, it is difficult to get good teachers to work in rural areas which can have a negative impact on the education of children in those rural communities.","In developing nations finding teachers who are willing to work in the rural areas is becoming difficult. As a result rural children often fail to get good education. There are several reasons behind this trend. The most important is the disparity in the wages of a rural teacher and an urban teacher.
In the developing or undeveloped world, people working in urban areas tend to earn a lot more than those working in the rural areas. Teachers are no different. A teacher working in the countryside earns much less than a teacher with comparable qualifications working in cities. Since salary is the first thing that most people consider while choosing a job, few teachers are willing to work in villages.
Rural areas also lack several amenities. Many of them don’t have facilities for recreation. For example, many villages do not have movies or clubs where people can relax after a long working day. Lack of internet connectivity is another problem that makes rural areas less attractive to people.
Unfortunately, when teachers refuse to work in the countryside, rural students suffer. Just like their urban counterparts, children living in rural areas also need quality education. For this reason, it is imperative that schools find good teachers. The government and school managements can encourage more teachers to work in villages by offering them salaries comparable to those earned by teachers working in the city. The government can make this happen by enacting laws that ensure that people practicing the same profession are paid the same wages throughout the country. Teachers also need to treat their profession as a noble vocation that has the potential to make difference to a lot of lives.
To conclude, low salaries are the main reason that discourages teachers from working in the countryside. The only way to solve this problem is to ensure that regardless of where they are working, teachers earn the same salaries throughout the country.",9,band-9-essay-about-teachers-not-wanting-to-work-in-rural-areas
192,"Learning English at school is often seen as more important than learning local languages. If these are not taught, many are at risk of dying out.","Sample response
English is the language of opportunity. It opens more doors than any other language. So, English is widely taught at schools all over the world. Sometimes this happens at the expense of local languages. In my opinion, teaching English at schools is important; however, communities also need to ensure that their own languages aren’t dying out.
The biggest advantage of learning English is that it is a universal language. People all over the world use it to communicate with others. The internet has made English even more important because much of the information on it is in the English language. Globalization is another factor driving the popularity of English. Companies have offices all over the world and they are looking for people who can converse in English.
However, just because English improves your career prospects, it doesn’t mean that your own languages are not important for you. A language is much more than a medium of expression. It is the mother of culture and civilization. When a language dies the culture associated with that language will also die. Because of this reason, nations must never allow their local languages to perish. They can achieve this by simply instilling national pride in their people.
It is perfectly possible to learn and teach English without neglecting one’s own languages. Take, for instance, the case of India. Hundreds of languages are spoken here. While English is widely taught as a second language and given too much importance, native Indian languages are also thriving because Indians learn English with the sole purpose of improving their career prospects. They are not learning it to become anglicized. In India, English is only used for official communications and every other type of communication happens in native languages. This allows Indians to stay true to their culture and at the same time find exciting job opportunities in the English speaking world.
To conclude, there are several benefits to learning English and hence I strongly recommend that it should be taught at school. However, governments and communities need to take measures to ensure that their own languages are not being neglected.

193,"Some people believe that it is better to keep criminals in prison for longer , while others disagree and say that we must find a different solution. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?","Crime rate is increasing in spite of stringent laws and punishments. Some people argue that the only way to reduce the rate of crime is to confine criminals to prison for long periods of time. Others, however, disagree. They feel that we should find alternative solutions to deal with the growing crime rates. In my opinion, criminals who commit serious crimes should be imprisoned for the rest of their lives but others need to be treated more leniently.
The fear of punishment almost always acts as a deterrent. Even if it does not reform people, it will prevent at least some of them from committing crimes. Most people don’t want to go to prison. That is why governments all over the world use imprisonment as a form of a punishment. Keeping the offender jailed for the rest of their lives will certainly prevent them from committing more crimes in future.
However, imprisonment does not stop crime completely. The problem with imprisonment is that it does not do anything to reform people. Rather it produces hardened criminals. It is common for people coming out of jail to commit more crimes. The only way to stop them is to keep them in prison for the rest of their lives. However, only people who commit heinous crimes can be given such punishments. If others are also given such punishments, that will amount to the violation of their basic human rights.
I personally feel that those committing less serious crimes like theft or arson should be sent to rehabilitation centres or ordered to do community work. Community work gives them an opportunity to give something back to the society. It might even make them better human beings.
To conclude, in my opinion, people who commit serious crimes should be confined to prison for the rest of their life because they pose a greater threat to humanity and those committing less serious crimes should be given an opportunity to reform themselves by doing community work or spending time in a rehab.",9,ielts-essay-sample-about-keeping-criminals-in-imprisoned-for-long
194,Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school. Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.,"Some people argue that homeschooling is better for the development of children while others disagree and opine that children should go to an educational institution. In my opinion, both home schooling and regular schooling have their merits and demerits. However, I am in favour of sending children to an educational institution because it is more beneficial for their overall development and prepares them for their future.
The biggest advantage of homeschooling is that children can learn at their pace and at a time convenient for them and their parent or teacher. Children attending regular schools cannot have this luxury. Also when children learn at home, their teacher or parent can give them 100 percent attention. This is particularly beneficial for slow learners who need more time and attention to grasp concepts.
On the flip side, when a child learns at home, she gets hardly any opportunity to interact with other children. A school is much more than a place where children learn alphabets and arithmetic. It is a microcosm of the world. Children get to interact with a lot of strangers at school. Also, they face many challenges. All of these improve their social skills and help them learn valuable coping skills which will prepare them for their future. By contrast, homeschooled children have hardly any interaction with the outside world and may be in for a rude shock when they enter the job market. Even if they do well in academics, their lack of social skills and real world experience may affect their ability to find a good job.
To conclude, while it is true that homeschooling does have some advantages, I am in favour of sending children to regular schools because a lot of skills that they learn at school cannot be learned or taught at home.

195,In many countries today there are many highly qualified graduates without employment.,"Unemployment is on the rise. In fact, even highly qualified graduates are now finding it difficult to get a job. There are several reasons behind this unfortunate development.
The ongoing economic crisis is one of the main reasons of unemployment. Recession has forced many organizations to stop hiring new people. As a result, fresh graduates receive no job offer. Even employed people are getting laid off due to the financial turmoil in world’s major economies. It should also be noted that major economies like the US, the UK and Germany have long stopped growing. When economic growth remains stagnant, the need for new talent also diminishes. This is the main reason behind the increase in unemployment in the developed world.
At the same time, there is an increase in the number of people graduating from universities. This is particularly true in the case of developing nations. Thanks to the economic growth in these nations, more and more students can now afford university education. For example, in India, the number of people who graduated in 2016 was significantly higher than the number of people who graduated from universities ten or fifteen years ago. Unfortunately, in spite of its rapid economic growth, the country still does not have enough jobs for all of its people. Another reason that leads to unemployment in developed nations is the outsourcing of jobs to developing nations where cheap labour is available.
Unemployment is likely to be a cause for concern in the coming years too. In my opinion, young graduates should stop waiting for job offers from Fortune 500 companies. Instead, they should find jobs themselves. The internet has actually made this easier. It allows people to sell their products or services to interested parties all over the world. Also, graduates seeking employment must stop the obsession with white collar jobs. If they don’t mind sweating it out, jobs are still available.
To conclude, unemployment can be attributed to two factors – the increase in the number of graduates and the decrease in economic growth. The only way to solve this problem is to encourage people to find employment themselves. This might require them to take up manual jobs but having a job is way better than having none at all.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-about-growing-unemployment
196,"Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Celebrity news and gossips have become quite popular in recent times. Newspapers and tabloids even have separate editions to cover celebrity news. Excessive coverage of celebrities makes it difficult to avoid them and children, like adults, consume too much celebrity news on a regular basis. Some people believe that if children get exposed to too much coverage of celebrities, it will affect their mental and physical development. I entirely agree with them.
Children who look at the images of celebrities in newspapers and magazines develop wrong perceptions of the body. Celebrities look perfect. There are no blemishes on their skin. They have flawless hair and perfect figures. What children don’t understand is that most of these images have been photoshopped to create unattainable standards of beauty. They idolize what they see in newspapers and television and aspire to have a face or body like that of their idol. And when they realize that in spite of their best efforts they can’t look as perfect as their idol, many of them start hating their body. Some fall into depression. Anorexia, a dangerous condition that prevents people from eating well, is particularly common among star-struck teenagers. The number of people opting for plastic surgery has increased manifold over the last few years. In spite of being aware of the dangers of these surgical procedures, young people are opting to go under the knife in their desperation to have that perfect body.
Children have impressionable minds. When they see the media glorifying the lifestyle of celebrities, they arrive at the conclusion that being successful is all about being rich and famous. So they try to imitate the lifestyle of famous people. They waste lots of money on expensive clothes and accessories.
To conclude, there is no denying the fact that excessive media coverage of celebrities is affecting the normal development of children. In my opinion, the media has to act more responsibly and stop creating unrealistic standards of beauty or success.",9,media-coverage-of-celebrities-is-affecting-the-development-of-children-ielts-essay-sample
197,"Air Traffic is increasingly leading to more noise, pollution, and airport construction. One reason for this is the growth in low-cost passenger flights, often to holiday destinations.","There is no denying the fact that air traffic leads to more air and noise pollution. Some people, therefore, feel that the government should tax it more heavily to discourage people from traveling by air. However, I am against that idea. In my opinion, increasing the tax on air travel will affect the economic development of the country.
The availability of low cost flights is the main reason that makes air travel more attractive. If tax is increased, it would make flights more expensive and less attractive. However, this move will affect the tourism industry which employs millions of people. Tourism is the backbone of many economies. Take, for instance, the case of Singapore. This small country attracts millions of tourists from all over the world because low cost flights to Singapore are available from most countries. If Singapore increased the tax on air traffic, it would reduce the number of foreigners visiting that country. It is thus evident that imposing heavy taxes on air travel will have serious repercussions on the economic development of a nation.
Affordability is not the only reason that made air travel popular. It is also convenient. It is indispensable for many business executives because it saves their time. If tax on air travel is increased, it would increase the operating costs of these companies and make them less profitable. What’s more, air transport is also used for the movement of goods. If it is taxed more heavily, it would increase the cost of essential goods.
In conclusion, I believe from the above mentioned points that the government should not increase taxes on air travel but look for other sustainable solutions to limit air traffic. For example, by improving the reliability of road and railways, the government can discourage people from taking a flight to travel short distances within the country.",9,ielts-essay-sample-government-should-increase-tax-in-air-travel
198,Some people think that the government should pay one of the parents of very young children to stay at home to look after their children. What do you think would be the advantages and disadvantages of this policy?,"In many families now both partners work. While this has improved their financial situation, it has made child rearing difficult. Many couples are therefore delaying parenthood. Some are forced to send their children to daycare centres where they may or may not receive proper care and attention. Therefore, some people feel that the government should give financial assistance to one of the parents so that they can stay at home and take care of their child. In my opinion, this policy has its pros and cons.
Of course, the biggest beneficiaries of this policy will be parents of young children. It will also encourage more couples to have children. Actually, this policy may be worth implementing in countries where the birthrate is dangerously low. When the government pays one of the parents to stay at home, they get to spend more time with their child. Several studies have shown that young children who spend more time with their parents have improved social and cognitive skills.
On the flip side, the government has to allocate a lot of money in its budget for paying parents. It is true that children are the assets of a nation; however, child rearing cannot be considered as a productive activity. It does not do anything to improve the GDP of a nation. So, when the government pays millions of fathers and mothers for just staying at home and taking care of their children, it will push the nation into financial difficulty. Looking from that perspective, it is not hard to see that this policy will only increase the tax burden of citizens. Also, it cannot be implemented in countries where the birthrate is already high. In my opinion, spending that money on sectors like education or healthcare will be more beneficial to the nation and its people.
After analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that giving parents financial assistance for taking care of their young ones has more disadvantages than advantages. Nations with very low population could perhaps experiment with this policy but others should find alternative ways to help parents of young children.",9,band-9-essay-sample-the-government-should-pay-one-of-the-parent-to-stay-at-home
199,"In many developing countries, there is a problem with declining quality of air and water from both industry and construction. What measures could be taken to prevent this?","The increase in development activities in the developing nations has led to a decrease in the quality of air and water. This is certainly a cause for concern; however, there are several ways to mitigate the impact of development on the environment.
When nations develop, their industrial output will increase. While this is good for their economy it is not always good for the environment. In many developing nations, there are no stringent laws or mechanisms to deal with industrial waste. Factories often dump their waste into oceans and rivers causing serious environmental damage. The increase in construction activity is another problem that causes pollution. Dust and debris from construction sites pollute the air and make people susceptible to various illnesses.
Once these nations have the necessary infrastructure in place, many of these problems may resolve on their own. In the meanwhile, however, there are several things that governments and industries can do.
Governments, for example, need to formulate strict laws that make companies accountable for their carbon footprint. Hefty penalties should be imposed on the violators. In addition, the government should insist that industries clean up the waste they generate. This might require them to invest in expensive waste treatment plants. The government can make this easier for them by offering subsidies. We, the public, can also contribute our bit. By keeping our surroundings clean and planting more trees, we can combat the threat of air pollution.
To conclude, there is no denying the fact that pollution is one of the main problems that developing nations face. However, a strong political will and concerted efforts by individuals and industries can go a long way in tackling the issue.",9,ielts-essay-about-increasing-air-and-water-pollution-in-developing-nations
200,The continued rise in the world’s population is the greatest problem faced by humanity at the present time. What are the causes of this continued rise? Do you agree that it is the greatest problem faced by humanity?,"Some people believe that the sharp increase in global population is the most serious problem that humanity faces. I agree with them because an increase in population will lead to fast depletion of natural resources and could even threaten our very existence on this planet.
Global population increased dramatically during the last century and this can be attributed to the development in health care facilities. Thanks to the availability of life saving drugs and vaccinations, more and more people are now able to live to 70 or 80. A lot of people live even longer. The general increase in longevity and the reduction in infant mortality rates are the main causes behind the population boom.
Longevity is good and desirable, but if the birth rate continues at this rate, we will soon run out of resources. When the population increases the demand for resources also increases. Currently over 7 billion people live on this planet. They all need food, water and shelter. To grow enough food for all the people, more land needs to cultivated. Since mankind can’t create any more land, an increase in population intensifies the battle for the available land. People have already cleared many forests for housing and agricultural needs. Deforestation upsets the balance of nature and causes several environmental disasters.
The increase in population also leads to man-animal conflict. Human beings have already encroached upon their land and now they have started venturing into our space. Wild animals like elephants, tigers, deer and pigs cause a great deal of damage to crops and even human life. The increase in population may also lead to more conflicts between nations. The concentration of wealth in a few nations will create resentment among others and it wouldn’t be long before the have-nots attack the haves.
To conclude, the massive growth in global population has even started threatening our very existence on this planet. If this trend continues, in the near future we might wage wars for food, water and land.",9,ielts-essay-sample-the-growth-in-population-is-the-biggest-threat-humanity-faces
201,Some people say that all secondary and higher secondary school students should be taught how to manage money as it is an important life skill. DO you agree or disagree with this argument?,"Everyone has to learn to manage their finances. Children are no different. Therefore I agree with the argument that money management skills should be taught in secondary and higher secondary schools. This practice will prepare young people for their future.
Since we need money to buy essential items and to lead a comfortable life, money management skills are crucial for our overall well-being and happiness. There are several benefits to teaching money management at school. A lot of children, especially those coming from rich families, receive generous amounts of pocket money. Many of them waste this money on unnecessary things because they don’t understand or appreciate the value of money. If money management is part of the curriculum, they will learn to use it judiciously. This learning will stand them in good stead throughout their life.
Also, after school, many children leave their home and move to far away cities to pursue higher education. Unless they know how to spend their money, they will soon run out of funds and put them and their families in trouble. If they learned money management at school this wouldn’t happen.
There is no right or wrong time to learn a skill; even so, the sooner we start the better. Today’s children are tomorrow’s adults. If they learn essential life skills today, it will benefit them and their country now and in the future. Last but not least, money management lessons may also improve the arithmetical skills of the children.
In summary, developing the foundation is crucial for any learning and having money management as a subject in schools will definitely prepare young people for their future.",9,ielts-essay-sample-money-management-should-be-taught-at-school

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","An increasing number of children now carry mobile phones. These gadgets were once a luxury for teens and adults, but now they have become a toy for young children. Some people believe that mobile phones have become an absolute necessity for children because of the safety concerns existing in the modern world. I don’t quite agree with this view. While I admit that mobile phones benefit children in many ways, I don’t think that they are a must-have.
Mobile phones are designed to help people stay connected on the go. The world is becoming a dangerous place, especially for children. The increase in crime rates and vehicular traffic has also increased concerns over the safety of children. Gone are the days when children could travel safely without putting themselves in danger. Since mobile phones allow parents to get in touch with their children whenever they want to, many parents give them to their children. The benefits of this arrangement are obvious.
However, in spite of all the arguments in favor of giving mobile phones to children, I don’t think that they are an all-in-one solution for all the problems faced by parents and children. In fact, carrying expensive mobile phones actually threatens the safety of children. What’s more, many schools have payphone facility that children can use in case of an emergency. Some parents have too much faith in technology. They believe that if their children carry mobile phones they are safe from all the dangers. Unfortunately, such false notions invite danger. In my opinion, young children are not supposed to be allowed to travel without the supervision of adults, be they teachers or parents.
To sum up, I don’t believe that mobile phones make children protected. I do see the benefits of giving children mobile phones, but I do not agree that they are an absolute necessity. If parents and teachers are really concerned about the safety of their children, what they need to do is to make children aware of the dangers lurking in the corner.",9,are-mobile-phones-a-necessity-for-young-children
203,The number of people who are at risk of serious health problems due to being overweight is increasing. What is the reason for the growth in overweight people in society? How can this problem be solved?,"Over the last few years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of overweight people in the world. This can be attributed to unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity. Obesity is a major health problem. It is a risk factor for diabetes, stroke and heart disease.
Excessive consumption of junk foods is the number one cause of obesity. Junk or fast foods are rich in calories and unhealthy fats. When we consume more calories than our body can burn, it will convert the excess calories into fat. As a result people who consume calorie rich foods on a regular basis gain weight. Late night dinners are another cause of weight gain. When we have a heavy meal immediately before going to bed, the body does not get an opportunity to burn it. Our sedentary lifestyle is also to blame. Most of us have jobs that allow us to spend our entire day in a chair. This lack of physical activity reduces our requirement for calories. Still, we are consuming more calories than we need.
Limiting the consumption of calories and making physical activity an important part of your routine is the only way to combat obesity. Our bodies are designed to move. When we exercise, we not only burn the excess calories but also reduce our risk for a variety of illnesses like diabetes and heart disease. We need to make proper changes to our eating habits too. We must make a conscious effort to stay away from fatty foods. We must also ensure that we are having low calorie healthy meals at regular intervals.

204,Some people think that keeping pets is good for children while others think it is dangerous and unhealthy. Which opinion do you agree with? Discuss both options and give examples.,"Whether to have a pet or not remains a controversial issue. While some people are against having pets, in my opinion, domestic animals have a positive impact on our physical and psychological health and wellbeing. Also they make great companions for our children.
People who are against having pets argue that playing with them can cause serious health problems in human beings especially children. Of course, there are people who keep spiders and snakes as their pets. These creatures are certainly dangerous and pose considerable threat to the life of their owners. However, the vast majority of pets do not belong to this category. Another argument against keeping pets is that they can cause skin allergies and aggravate bronchial asthma. These health concerns are real and I feel that people who are susceptible to them should stay away from animals. Animal rights activists also claim that keeping pets away from their natural habitats will affect their health and the food chain. However, in my opinion, if their owners take good care of them, keeping them at home is unlikely to have any adverse impact on their health.
While it is true that keeping a pet may have some ill effects on our health, the benefits of having one are more significant. Pets improve our mood and health. Playing with the pets or taking them for a walk will keep both children and adults fit and healthy. What’s more, most people keep dogs, cats and fish; however, serious accidents caused by pets remain rare and statistically insignificant. Last but not the least, having a pet makes children more responsible. They learn to take care of another life and also become more sensitive, caring and sympathetic.
To sum up, although there are some minor drawbacks to owning a pet, in my opinion, the advantages of having a pet are far more significant. Pets make great companions and prevent depression in children and adults.

205,"Some people say that the best way to improve public health is to increase the number of sports facilities. Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are also required.","Sports and games play an important role in our lives. They keep us mentally and physically fit. Some people, therefore, feel that building more sports facilities is the most effective way to improve public health. While I agree with this argument to a certain extent, in my opinion, other measures are also required.
Most people enjoy playing sports and games. Sports are essentially a leisure time activity for us. If we have access to good sports facilities, we will readily use them. Playing a sport has several health benefits. It keeps us fit, alert and agile. Unfortunately, there are not many sports facilities in our towns or cities. As a result, few people can take advantage of them even if they want to. Building more sports facilities, therefore, is the easiest way to ensure that more people can play sports and games.
However, this does not mean that building more playgrounds or sports clubs is all that the government needs to do to improve public health. Actually, a lot of factors affect public health. In order to be healthy, we should adopt healthy eating habits. In addition, we should have access to health care facilities. The quality of our surroundings is another factor that affects our health. Pollution is a major problem in many of our cities. If it goes unchecked, public health will not improve even if we build numerous sports clubs.
To conclude, building more sports facilities is just one of the many things that the government needs to do to improve public health. It is also important to control pollution and make health care facilities accessible to everyone.",9,ielts-essay-sample-building-more-sports-facilities-is-the-best-way-to-improve-public-health
206,The most important thing about a job is how much money you earn in that job. Do you agree or disagree?,"While it is being argued that salary should be the prime criterion for choosing a job, in my view, a safe and stress-free working environment is as important as the financial benefits gained from a job.
Of course, money is much more than a means for satisfying one’s needs in this materialistic world. It is also a status symbol. Being supported by a prestigious salary certainly allows the employee to afford spending on housing, travelling, health insurance and recreation. The weight of the pay packet also affects the performance of the employee. Underpaid employees are more likely to work in a careless manner because they lack the motivation to work harder. This feeling of dissatisfaction can result in the failure of an organization if it is prevalent among all of its employees. It is thus evident that the income that an employee obtains from a job will play a crucial role in determining their willingness to continue in that position.
This, however, does not mean that salary is the only thing to consider while choosing a job. For most employees, a safe and stress-free working environment is equally important. Working in a hazardous industry can lead to consequences that cannot be compensated with whatever amounts of money. For example, people working in the mining industry run the risk of getting buried while digging in mines. Although they are well-paid, their salary won’t help them if they die or get seriously injured. Likewise, unachievable targets and tight deadlines are the norm at many organizations. They put tremendous pressure on employees and hinder their personal and professional life. For example, in Japan, a lot of people commit suicide because of work pressure. The reasons mentioned above clearly show that several factors other than financial advantages need to be considered while proceeding with a job offer.
To sum up, in my view a safe and stress-free working environment is as important as a fat salary. We need money to meet our expenses. We need to stay safe from injuries and illnesses too.",9,band-9-essay-sample-the-most-important-thing-about-a-job-is-the-salary
207,Some People think that the government is wasting money on the arts and that this money could be better spent elsewhere. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Governments all over the world are grappling with problems like rising unemployment and growing threats of terrorism. Poverty is still a major issue in many countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa. In such a scenario, the argument that the government should stop wasting money on arts might sound logical. However, in my opinion, arts do have a place in the society. While I don’t think that the government should waste a lot of money on arts, it should at least adopt a benevolent attitude towards arts and artists.
Contrary to popular belief, arts are not a waste of time. In fact, they are also an industry with great potential to generate money. Performance arts, for instance, enjoy considerable following. A music concert or a dance show featuring an accomplished singer or dancer can create a lot of jobs. Arts can also help sell a country as a tourist destination. For example, the Indian government actively uses traditional arts forms to promote tourism in the country. India’s classical dance forms like Bharatanatyam and Kathakali have enthralled audience all over of the world and attract thousands of international tourists to the nation. The influx of tourists creates jobs and helps the local economy.
Paintings and sculptures also have huge commercial value. Millions of people visit museums in Spain, Italy and Holland to admire the works of masters like Vincent Van Gog, Picasso and Salvador Daly. While these artists are no longer around, their timeless works are still earning a lot of money for their countries. Nations that promote their ethic arts and crafts also tend to enjoy good reputation overseas.
To conclude, while it is true that spending money on imparting education and building infrastructure is more important than promoting arts, in my opinion, the government should still do whatever it can to promote and sustain arts. Art forms, especially those that have a huge following, benefit the national economy in many ways.",9,band-9-essay-sample-government-should-stop-wasting-money-on-arts
208,Most societies have their homeless people. Some people think that the best way to help them is to give them money. To what extent do you agree?,"In this twenty-first century, it is surprising that many people still have no homes. Some people argue that the governments should help the homeless by giving them money. I do not agree with this argument. In my opinion, giving cash to homeless people will only worsen the situation.
Homelessness in most cases is a result of laziness. When the government rewards it with monetary help, the homeless people will have no motivation to earn money to enjoy home ownership. Instead, they will want to continue to enjoy government benefits. Worse, people who are already struggling to make a living will start assuming that being homeless is the easiest way to gain help from the government. So instead of doing anything to improve their living standards, they too will start queuing up for benefits.
Being homeless is a miserable state. Also it does not reflect well on a society when people sleep on the streets. So, in order to help the poor people, the government should put them in a community shelter for a limited period and also get them involved in some work. To improve their employability, the government should give them vocational training. And once they have acquired the necessary skills they should be encouraged to find a job and a home on their own. If the government continues to give them financial assistance, they will not do anything to improve their living standards.
To conclude, instead of giving financial benefits and free accommodation to homeless people, the government should provide them with training that will help them to find a job and earn money. And when they have money, they can buy a home on their own.",9,band-9-essay-sample-government-should-give-money-to-homeless-people
209,"Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","The wealth of a nation is its people. Even in this twenty-first century millions of people living in poor nations do not have access to health care facilities or education. Since their governments lack the financial means to improve their living standards, some people feel that the rich nations should help them by providing financial aid. I agree with this argument. In my opinion when rich nations help poor nations, it is a win-win situation for both.
Rich nations have excess funds. By giving financial aid to poor nations, they can improve the living standards in the third-world. Poverty is the root cause of many social evils. It is a well-known fact that poor countries are the breeding grounds of several anti-social elements. The poor, in general, are unhappy with their own lives. They are also angry with the rich. Needless to say, many of them have criminal tendencies. It is not possible to reform them without improving their living standards. By providing financial assistance to poor nations, the rich countries can alleviate poverty in those nations and make the world a more peaceful place to live in.
Giving financial assistance to poor nations makes excellent business sense too. When poor nations develop, the purchasing power of their people will increase. This provides a great opportunity for rich nations that are also the hub of manufacturing. By helping the poor grow, they can increase their wealth too.
To conclude, when rich nations give financial assistance to poor nations, they are not only being generous but also helping their own industries and people. Irrespective of our gender, nationality or religion, everyone deserves access to good food, health and education. Therefore, in my opinion, nations that have excess funds should use them for the betterment of poor nations. After all, we all belong to the family of humanity.",9,band-9-essay-sample-the-rich-nations-should-help-the-poor-nations
210,It is generally believed that the Internet is an excellent means of communication but some people suggest that it may not be the best place to find information. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"The internet has revolutionized our lives. It has changed the way we communicate and research. According to some people, the internet is a great communication tool but it is not a reliable source of information. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, the internet is not only an excellent communication tool but also a treasure trove of information.
The internet has given us access to a vast pool of information. In fact, anyone who has access to a smart phone and an internet connection can now find information on just about any subject within a matter of seconds. This ease of finding information online has even made physical libraries redundant.
The main problem with finding information online is that we cannot always trust the source. The internet allows anyone and everyone to be a writer and a publisher. You can blog on any topic; you can post your opinions on any subjects. No one will ask you whether you are qualified to do so. As a result, some of the information that we find online is not very reliable. This, however, does not mean that all the information on the internet is erroneous.
While I admit that it is possible to find factually incorrect information on some lesser known websites, blogs and forums, the truth is that the vast majority of these unreliable sources do not make it to search results. When you do a Google search for a particular keyword, the websites that pop up are authority sites that do their research before posting information online. Take, for instance, the case of online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Anyone can edit it so we might think that it will contain a lot of mistakes. On the contrary, Wikipedia does not contain any more errors than the celebrated Encyclopedia Britannica because it has committed editors and writers who want to provide the most authentic information to their readers.
To conclude, I do not agree with the argument that the internet is not a reliable place to find information. If we only refer to authority websites and blogs we do not have to worry about the authenticity of the information we find.",9,band-9-essay-sample-the-internet-is-not-a-reliable-source-of-information
211,Differences between countries are becoming less. Nowadays people all over the world are adopting similar fashion and trends. Do you think disadvantages outweigh the advantages?,"Globalization, open economy and advancements in communication technologies have had both positive and negative impacts on our lives. The world has become a global village where everyone wears the same kind of outfits, watches the same films, listens to the same music and eats the same food. In my opinion, this trend is more disadvantageous owing to its consequences in the developing world.
Thanks to speedier modes of transportation and advancements in communication technologies, ideas, technologies, fashion, trends and products can easily travel between countries. The only country that benefits from this phenomenon is the country where these innovations originate. In most cases, this is a developed nation like the United States. When everyone copies American fashion and buys American products, American companies flourish. For example, Apple products are now a craze all over the world. Since it is an American company when Apple sells more smart phones and tablets, the real beneficiary is the US economy. At the same time, smaller manufacturers in the developing world like India or China are struggling to compete with giants like Apple and Samsung. This creates unemployment in these nations.
Another major disadvantage of globalization is that smaller and less developed nations are losing their cultural heritage. Take, for instance, the growing popularity of western outfits in Asia and Africa. People all over the world now use jeans while it is only suitable for use in cold countries. Yet you find men and women wearing jeans in a tropical country like India. This blind copying of fashion and trends cause several health problems for people who adopt them without questioning their suitability. It also kills the ethnic garment industry in their countries.
To conclude, when everyone adopts the same trends, the real beneficiaries are the makers of those trends. The rest of the world does not gain anything from this arrangement. Therefore, in my opinion, the lessening of differences between nations is more disadvantageous.",9,ielts-essay-sample-differences-between-nations-are-becoming-negligible
212,Is freedom of speech essential in a free society? Give reasons for your answer.,"In a free society everyone should be able to express their thoughts and opinions freely. Unfortunately, if everyone freely expresses their thoughts, there will be more conflicts than consensuses because my words can offend or hurt another person. Because of this reason I believe that freedom of speech is essential for the functioning of a free society, but there should be some restrictions on it.
In this age of blogging and social media when anyone can become a writer and a publisher, freedom of speech is one of the most abused fundamental rights. Just because we are living in a free society, it does not mean that we should be allowed to say whatever we want. A lot of people have too much confidence in their constitutional right to freedom of speech. They freely post all kinds of stuff on social media and online forums. This leads to a lot of problems, even lawsuits. Posting derogatory stuff about another person just because you have the right to express your thoughts is not only mean but also illegal. In my opinion, there should be strict laws to deal with this menace. No one should be allowed to hurt another person in the name of freedom of speech or expression.
Not only the citizens, the media also sometimes abuse their freedom of speech. They often publish private or sensational information about public personalities. Recently when the Indian Army was carrying out a military action against terrorists, a news channel broadcast up-to-the-minute details of the operation from the scene. They thought they were exercising their freedom of expression. Unfortunately, such thoughtless actions even put the safety of soldiers and civilians at risk. Also they reveal vital clues about the place using which terrorists can refine their attacks in the future.
To conclude, freedom of speech should be entertained as long as it does not hurt the interests of others or the nation. When people express their thoughts, they have a duty to think about the consequences. What’s more, there should be stringent laws to deal with those who abuse their right to express themselves.",9,band-9-essay-sample-is-freedom-of-speech-essential-in-a-free-society
213,It is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. Give some reasons why this change has happened and suggest how families could be brought closer together. Include any relevant examples from your experience. You should write at least 250 words.,"There is no denying the fact that family ties are becoming weaker. This is particularly true in western countries where relationships are becoming less and less relevant. There are several reasons behind this unfortunate development. The most important, of course, is the change in our lifestyles, values and goals.
Families that spend a lot of time together tend to be closer. And families where the members rarely come face to face with one another have hardly anything that ties them together. In the olden days parents and children used to live and work together. In many families, children pursued the same career as their father. They learned the trade or craft from their parents and elder siblings. This allowed them to spend more time with their family and that made their relationships stronger.
Now we are living in the age of individualism. Everyone needs their space. This has made us more self-centred than our parents or grandparents. This also reflects in our relationships. We no longer believe in making adjustments or compromises. We want everything our way. This attitude creates strain in our relationships.
There is yet another reason that affects family bonds. People are increasingly moving to another city or country in search of better education, jobs or living standards. They leave their family behind. While it is possible to keep in touch through modern communication means, an email or phone call is not equal to a face-to-face interaction. The only way to forge better ties with our near and dear ones is to spend more time with them. We must realize that our biggest strength is our family. Relationships are like potted plants. We need to nourish them. If we don’t give them the love and affection they need, they will wilt.
To conclude, if we need better family relationships we must be willing to adjust and compromise. We must realize that the only way to win love is to give love. Instead of confining ourselves to our space, we must come out of it. We must let others in too.",9,band-9-essay-sample-about-weak-family-relationships
214,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?","Computers have become an integral part of our lives. They are now used in almost all sectors like healthcare, education, administration and banking. In the future, these machines could even support human life. For example, they could be used as a substitute for certain organs. They already help surgeons in the operation theatre. In the future, they might perform the surgeries themselves. In my opinion, computers have improved our lives in myriad ways. However, over dependence on them will result in several problems.
Computers have made our lives easier in numerous ways. They have increased our efficiency. They have made learning and teaching easier. They also allow us to communicate more efficiently. In fact, computers have made physical boundaries irrelevant. No matter where we are in the world, we can now stay connected to our near and dear ones living in another country or continent with the help of computers.
In the future, computers will have greater applications in fields like education, healthcare and banking. I wouldn’t be surprised if someday they replaced human teachers or doctors. Unfortunately, computer technology has its shortcomings too. Online frauds are already costing nations billions of dollars. Increased use of computers will also lead to an increase in cybercrime. In the future, identity theft will create a lot more problems than it does now. Also, computers are machines that can breakdown at any time. If we don’t back up our data on a regular basis, we can lose it. And in spite of our best efforts, malicious software can wipe or steal our data without our knowledge. Computers can even affect our memory. They eliminate the need to remember even simple spellings and passwords. Excessive use of computers will also lead to several health problems.
To conclude, computers are good and useful. But if we become overly dependent on them, we may face several problems. In my opinion, we should use computers only in cases where the benefits of using them outweigh the disadvantages.

215,"As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being.","Most of us now spend a great deal of our time at the workplace. If we love our work, we will get to spend much of our lives doing things that we enjoy doing. Because of this reason job satisfaction plays an important role in ensuring our wellbeing. In fact, people who are satisfied with their jobs are healthier and happier.
Job satisfaction means different things to different people. For some, it means earning a six figure salary or occupying a higher level position in an organization. A lot of people equate wealth and social status with happiness and wellness. They don’t mind spending their entire lives at the workplace provided that they receive handsome salaries.
Some people may have well-paying jobs but they are still unhappy because they don’t like what they are doing. There are also people who find satisfaction in helping others. Money does not motivate them. They are driven by their passion to change the world. Most of them will readily work for an NGO or some other charity.
While it is true that everyone seeks job satisfaction, few people actually manage to find it. The rest are simply spending their time at the workplace with the sole objective of earning a livelihood. They don’t like their job, but they can’t quite it either because they need money to support their family. The vast majority of workers, unfortunately, belong to this category. This dissatisfaction with their work and the lack of motivation to do it eventually lead to various health problems in these people. Several studies have shown that work related stress is a major cause of health problems in adults.
To conclude, everyone seeks job satisfaction, but very few people manage to find it. While job satisfaction can mean money or social status for some people, others find happiness in doing things that they enjoy.",9,band-9-essay-about-the-importance-of-job-satisfaction
216,It is important for school children to learn about local history rather than world history. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"We learn quite a few things from history. It helps us to understand the progress of nations and civilizations. Some people believe that local history is more important than international history for school children. I don’t agree with this view. In my opinion, national and international histories are as important as local history.
There is no denying the fact that children should learn local history. It helps them to stay connected to their roots. Children who understand the history of their district or state are more likely to appreciate their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. This knowledge will help them to grow into proud citizens.
While it is true that children have several reasons to learn local history, they have an equal number of reasons to learn international history. To start with, we all belong to this world. In this day and age when the world has become a global village the line between local and foreign histories are blurring.
Today’s school children are the citizens of tomorrow. When they grow up many of them will move to foreign countries in search of jobs or higher education. Actually, a large number of them will even migrate to foreign countries. Learning international history makes such migrations easier. It also prevents children from falling into the trap of chauvinism. When children understand that the histories of other countries are as glorious as the history of their own country, they will learn to appreciate and respect foreign cultures and civilizations.
To conclude, it is impossible to say whether local history is more important than foreign history. Children should learn both to get a better understanding of the world and its workings.",9,band-9-essay-sample-local-history-is-more-important-than-foreign-history
217,In some countries an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Imposing a higher tax on fast food will only marginally affect its consumption. Fast food consumption is particularly common among the rich. Price is of little concern to them. They prefer it because they put convenience before health. Nowadays most people are busy and as a result, they don’t have the time or patience to cook a proper meal. Fast food companies cater to this segment. Even if the government increases the tax on junk foods, they will continue to consume them. On the other hand, some people choose fast food because they have no alternative. Many people living in large cities away from their families do not have access to healthy home food. Expensive restaurants too are way beyond their reach. So, most of them subsist on fast food. If higher tax is imposed on these food items, it will make them unaffordable to many poor people. This will lead to more problems.
Instead of increasing the tax on fast food, the government should make healthy food more affordable and create awareness about the ill effects of junk food consumption. It can rope in celebrities and media personalities for promoting healthy eating habits. If the government exerts too much interference in the market, it will only hurt the local economy.
To conclude, to cope with the dangers caused by the excessive consumption of fast food, the government should focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle, rather than simply charging a higher tax on fast food.",9,band-9-essay-sample-about-increasing-tax-on-food-items
218,"Even though organic fruits and vegetables are more expensive than conventional fruits and vegetables, they are worth the extra cost. Do you agree or disagree.","Organic fruits and vegetables are becoming more and more popular because they are healthier. Organic crops are grown without the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. As a result they taste better and contain more nutrients. Therefore, I agree with the argument that organic foods their higher price tags.
To start with, the cultivation of organic crops requires more time and effort. Since this kind of farming does not permit the use of synthetic fertilizers or pesticides, organic crops have increased risk of getting damaged by pests and weeds. By contrast, conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers and pesticides abundantly. As a result, they get much better yields and can sell their products at a low price. Since it is not easy to grow organic fruits and vegetables on a commercial basis, they are more expensive than regular crops. However, their quality justifies their higher price.
Organic products are safe and healthy. Dangerous levels of pesticides are found in crops grown using the traditional method. People who consume such foods on a prolonged basis have increased risk of developing health problems like cancer. It is true that pesticides increased yield but they also led to a variety of diseases. As a result there is now growing awareness against the use of pesticides. Prevention is better than cure. By switching to organic foods people can reduce their risk for cancer and other diseases to a great extent. In other words, by spending a little bit more today, people can save much more on their hospital bills in the future. What’s more, if more people start using organic foods, then more farmers will adopt this method of cultivation and prices will eventually come down.
To conclude, the nutritional value and health benefits of organic foods completely justify their increased price. I hope the government will support organic crops and facilitate their commercial cultivation.",9,band-9-essay-about-organic-fruits-and-vegetables
219,Successful sports professionals can earn a great deal more money than people in other important professions. Some people think this is fully justified while others think it is unfair.,"Here is a sample essay
Compared to other professionals, sportsmen earn a lot more money. Some people believe that this is unfair; however, in my opinion, it is justified. I believe that a person’s salary should reflect the amount of money they can generate.
International sporting events attract a global audience and help generate a lot of money and jobs. These events are huge commercial successes. They also boost tourism. In fact, the city that hosts an international event like Olympics or World Cup Football gains international recognition. Its infrastructure gets a tremendous boost and thus its standard of living improves.
Success of major sporting events hinges upon the performance of internationally acclaimed sportsmen and women. Since their participation is crucial to the success of these events, I believe that their exorbitant salaries are justified.
Of course, I admit the fact that a doctor or a teacher is more useful to the society than a swimmer or a sprinter. Still, people pursuing these professions earn much less money than sports people. In my opinion, this is a case of supply exceeding demand. There are plenty of doctors, engineers and advocates. By contrast, there aren’t many internationally acclaimed sports personalities. For example, there is only one Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps. Likewise, there is only one Serena Williams or Lionel Messi. Obviously, they earn a lot more than a doctor or an attorney. Actually, they earn a lot more than other less successful sports people.
To conclude, the amount of money that a sportsman or sportswoman earns is a direct reflection of their potential to generate money. Successful sportsmen not only earn money for themselves; they also help generate jobs and money. Therefore, I believe that their higher salaries are justified.",9,band-9-essay-about-the-huge-salaries-of-sports-people
220,News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. What factors do you think influence these decisions? Have we become used to bad news? Wouldn’t it be better if more good news was reported?,"Editors play a decisive role in determining what news should be broadcast on television and printed in newspapers. These decisions are affected by a variety of factors like market economics, political affiliations and profitability.
Most of our news channels and newspapers are owned by private organizations. Their chief concern is making money so only news that has the potential to grab eyeballs is given coverage. Since bad news grabs more attention, it is given more importance. Sometimes news items that are important for the public are given less or no coverage because they don’t appeal to advertisers. While I agree with the argument that good news should be given more coverage, I don’t expect to see this anytime soon.
The preference of the readers or viewers has an impact on the kind of news being reported. A lot of us get drawn to bad news such as crime, violence, death and destruction more quickly than good news. This is probably because such items inspire shock and awe. It is therefore understandable why bad news is given more importance than good news. Unfortunately, excessive coverage of bad news creates a sense of insecurity in the society. This does not serve public interests, but it might protect the interests of advertisers. For example, when too many incidents of robbery are reported, it is quite normal for the sale of CCTV cameras and burglar alarms to go through the roof. It is, therefore, evident that bad news serves commercial interests better than good news.
To conclude, editors are influenced by a variety of factors and always choose news items that serve their and their advertisers’ interests. They might change this stance if the readers and viewers turn a blind eye to such content; however, I don’t see this happening anytime soon because the public too relish such content.

221,Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"More and more people are now traveling to other countries for higher studies, medical treatment, business and tourism. Some people feel that visitors should follow the culture and tradition of their host country when they are abroad. Others, however, feel that the host nation should respect cultural diversity. In my opinion, visitors should respect the local culture. The host country should also show a willingness to embrace cultures from around the world.
There are several advantages to respecting diverse cultures. To start with, it creates a cosmopolitan environment in the country and develops a sense of tolerance in the people. This attitude will benefit them when they visit another country. Another benefit of embracing diversity is that it makes life more interesting. Variety, after all, is the spice of life. When people belonging to different cultures live in one place everyone will be able to enjoy a variety of cuisines, wear different kinds of clothes, celebrate exotic festivals and learn several languages. This not only makes life more interesting but also helps the local economy. The United States and the European Union nations are home to people from all over the world. Their success and their growth rates are a result of their willingness to accept the best talent from all over the world irrespective of their cultural backgrounds.
While it is true that a nation can benefit from cultural diversity, it does not mean that local cultures and traditions should be ignored. They should be promoted too and a nation can encourage visitors to follow the local customs; however, in my opinion, imposing them on a visitor is unwarranted. Visitors who follow the local customs also benefit. They have better chances of blending themselves with the local community. They also enjoy greater degree of acceptance.
To conclude, a host country should always welcome diverse people with diverse cultures from all over the world; however, this should not be at the expense of the local culture.",9,band-9-essay-sample-visitors-should-follow-local-customs-and-traditions
222,Spending several hours in front of a TV or computer affect the intellectual development of children. Do you agree or disagree with the given statement?,"New media such as computers, tablets, television and smart phones occupy too much space in our lives and consume a lot of time. Children as well as adults are hooked to their screens. A lot of people believe that spending several hours in front of the computer affects the mental abilities of children. In my opinion, screen time can be both good and bad.
The first thing that we need to consider is the amount of time spent in front of the TV or computer. Too many hours are certainly bad for the intellectual and physical development of a child. Excessive screen time will result in physical inactivity and various health problems.
The age of the child is another thing that should be considered. Babies and toddlers need interaction to learn. When they smile they need someone who will smile in return. They need to touch, feel and manipulate in order to learn about forms, dimensions, consistency etc. A computer is completely unable to offer them that sort of learning environment. For older children I think this is different. School going children should learn how to use a computer, do research on the internet and choose a TV program or game.
The last thing that needs to be considered is the quality of the content. Not all TV programs or computer games are of bad quality. Actually, some do have educational value and children should learn to tell the good from the bad.
To conclude, my belief is that spending time watching television, on the internet or playing computer games can be beneficial for children if it is supervised by parents. They should oversee the quality and set a time frame.  Moreover, I believe that parents should share interesting content with their children. Children will inevitably have to use these devices a few years later and learning how to use them in their childhood will only help their intellectual development.",9,band-9-essay-sample-watching-tv-or-playing-video-games-affect-the-intellectual-development-of-children
223,In some countries an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Fast food has become a way of life because of our hectic lifestyles. We are always in a hurry and have little time or patience for cooking a proper meal. Stores like McDonalds and KFC have become very popular among all age groups because they serve snacks and meals round the clock. There is no waiting period. You are served as soon as you enter their food joint. Unfortunately, excessive consumption of fast food result in several health problems. One way of reducing its consumption is to make it unaffordable. Therefore, I support the argument that the government should increase tax on fast foods.
There is no denying the fact fast foods keep us full all the time, but they are also the number one reason behind our bulging waistlines. My boyfriend, for example, is a huge fan of Burger King. An investor relations manager in London, he is constantly hopping from one meeting to the next and does not have time to cook meals. So, whenever he feels hungry he grabs a burger and keeps himself satiated. This, in his opinion, is better than staying hungry. There are millions of people like him.
Unfortunately, fast food is rich in bad cholesterol. It might lead to abnormalities in lipid profile and cause heart diseases. I am a doctor and one of my patients, a 25 year old man, had suffered myocardial infarction at a young age because of hypertension and hyperlipidemia caused by an improper diet full of fat.
It is true that fast food is convenient but the health consequences make it dangerous. Therefore, I firmly believe that the government should regulate the fast food industry by setting up a special department entrusted with the job of checking the quality of ingredients used by fast food companies. In the short term, imposing higher tax on fast foods is the best option. When taxes are increased, fast foods will become less affordable and that will encourage many people to switch to healthier and cheaper alternatives.",9,band-9-essay-sample-tax-on-fast-foods-should-be-increased
224,Many countries spend too much money on training of a few individuals for international sports competitions. Some people think that governments should invest more in ordinary people instead. Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and examples.,"Throughout human history sport was and still is one of the major types of entertainment. Colosseum battles, Olympic Games, and other countless sports competitions play an enormous role in our life. The better the performance of athletes, the more interesting and exciting the game. However, in order to deliver a good performance, sportsmen require monetary support. Therefore, I disagree with the argument that governments should cut down their investments in sport. In this essay I am going to highlight the importance of government funding in national sports clubs.
First, every single country wants to prove that they are the best in the world. There are multiple ways to prove this and sport is one of them. Each year various international competitions take place around the globe. America is the unbeaten leader in many of these events and it is not surprising. Annual government reports show that the US investments in its sports clubs are one of the highest. By contrast, African government spends just over 10% of their budget on sport. This fact easily explains why America outperforms most other countries in sports.
Second, success in international games unites a nation. For instance, when Brazilian soccer team won the gold in the recent Olympic Games in Rio, the entire nation celebrated the success for almost three days. People became very proud of their nation. These victories increase national pride and tilt public opinion in favour of the country and its government. People forget other shortcomings of their nation.
To recapitulate, sport has the power to unite people. When a country loses in international competitions it harms the morale of its people. Therefore, I strongly believe that governments should provide funding to sports clubs and athletes.",9,band-8-5-essay-sample-should-governments-spend-money-for-training-sports-people
225,Some people believe all children should be taught together. Others say that they should be separated according to academic abilities. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"As competition for jobs is becoming tougher and tougher, there are several different views on how young students should be taught in the classroom. While some people argue that regardless of their academic performances, youngsters should be taught together, others are firm in their belief that classrooms need to be divided according to the academic skills of the students. I also agree with the latter view.
There are a few benefits to grouping children together. Students, who are sensitive to peer-pressure, are less likely to feel isolated from their peers when they study in the same classroom. If poor performers are separated from brilliant students and taught in another classroom, they may feel a sense of abandonment. As a result of this, they may develop mental and physiological problems which will inevitably have a detrimental effect on their lives in the future.
On the flip side, separating students on the basis of their academic skills has its merits too. This separation will benefit them when they enter the job market. We are now living in an age of cut-throat competition. Students need superior academic credentials to survive in this competitive environment. The education system needs to be revamped to meet the different needs of students at different levels. When students of different intellectual levels are put together, teachers will not be able to teach effectively because the level of understanding of the subject will be different among students. Slow students need more attention. When a class is a mix of students of different skills, the teacher will not be able to spend more time on any particular student. Therefore, this type of grouping will only produce mediocre students who will struggle to secure a well-paying job.
To conclude, while there are some benefits to grouping students together, I strongly believe that separating them will be more beneficial to them. This way, teachers can give slow students more attention and help them compete better.",9,band-9-essay-sample-students-should-be-separated-according-to-their-academic-skills
226,In many parts of the world people do research in family history. Some people believe research on previous generation to be useful while others say that it is better to focus on present and future generation.,"People all over the world like to know about their ancestors and family history. Some people feel that it makes great sense to research one’s family background. Others, however, oppose this view. In their opinion, we should concentrate more on the present and future generations. In my opinion, it depends upon the individual. If one really wants to know about one’s ancestors, I see no harm in researching one’s family history.
There are several benefits to researching one’s family background. Many diseases, for example, are hereditary. Someone who studies their family history will be able to identify the diseases that run in their family. This information will help them stay better equipped to deal with such diseases. Studying one’s family history is also a great way to discover the culture and traditions of one’s family. This research may help people stay rooted in their culture. What’s more, people feel proud when they discover that their family had a glorious history.
On the flip side, not everyone is fortunate enough to have a glorious family history. Some people therefore feel that researching one’s family history may reveal embarrassing or disturbing information about one’s ancestors. In their opinion, our present is far more important than our past. So, they opine that instead of wasting time on family research, we should focus on the present and future. After all, the past is past and there is nothing we can do about it. Therefore, it makes greater sense to focus on our future.
To conclude, everyone has the right to learn about their forefathers. This, however, does not mean that everyone should research their family. People who are interested in discovering more about their families should be able to do it and others should just focus on the future.",9,band-9-essay-sample-merits-and-demerits-of-researching-ones-family-history
227,Recent figures show an increase in violent crime among youngsters under the age of 18. Some psychologists claim that the basic reason for this is that children these days are not getting the social and emotional learning they need from parents and teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this option?,"Here is a sample essay. It is an edited version of an essay submitted by one of our readers.
Psychologists claim that the rise in criminal activities among young people is due to the lack of social and emotional guidance from teachers and parents. I agree with the above statement to some extent; however, in my opinion, other social and economical factors also contribute to the surge in criminal offences.
Parents and teachers play an important role in the moral development of children. They are their source of guidance and support. For example, a child who is bullied at school may go up to his/her teacher for support. Here it is the teacher who tells the students what is right and wrong. By doing so the teacher is inculcating good values in the students. However, nowadays, teachers only focus on academics; they do not spend time on instilling values. Interactions between parents and children are also becoming fewer and fewer. In many families now both parents work. Long working hours prevent them from interacting with their children. Children who don’t have a good rapport with their parents often turn to other sources for support and guidance. Unfortunately, such sources may get them into unhealthy or illegal activities like drinking, smoking and gambling. Children who get into bad company will eventually become criminals. Parents and teachers can prevent this from happening by providing children the emotional support they need.
External influences such as media, availability of drugs and peer pressure also contribute to the rise in crime rates. When commercials and movies glorify smoking and drinking, young people often get carried away and experiment with them. They end up getting intoxicated and this increases their chances of committing crimes.
To conclude, several factors contribute to the alarming increase of crimes all over the world. Not getting emotional support from parents and teachers is one of them. There are several other factors too. Identifying and eliminating all of these factors is necessary to reduce crime rate among youngsters.",9,band-9-essay-sample-children-are-getting-into-crime-because-of-the-lack-of-emotional-support-from-parents-and-teachers
228,Many people say that the only way to guarantee a good job is to complete a course of university education. Others claim that it is better to start work after school and gain experience in the world of work. How far do you agree or disagree with the above views?,"Here is a sample essay
Many people believe that completing a university degree is the only way to get a good job; others think work experience matters more. While universities prepare an individual theoretically, working after school equips a person with skills required for coping in the workplace. In my opinion, both the aforementioned arguments are true to a certain extent.
A university degree enhances an individual’s knowledge and promotes intellectual reasoning. This training makes an individual more mature and ready to face the challenges of the workplace. For example, when I was at university, most of our assignments involved critical thinking and research; this has expanded my knowledge in my field. In this modern world, most employers especially those in sectors like finance and health insist that all applicants should have a degree. A student who starts working immediately after leaving school will not be able to obtain a professional degree and hence cannot find employment in these sectors.
On the flip side, there are several benefits to getting a job soon after leaving school. A job will give the individual valuable work experience; however it is limited to certain occupations such as those in arts and crafts, fashion designing and cooking where creativity and skills matter more. For example, my friend, who is a chef at a famous restaurant never went to a cooking school; however, she makes delicious food because she has been working at a restaurant ever since she left school. This experience helped her polish her cooking skills.
To conclude, both university education and work experience have a role in guaranteeing a good job. Some occupations require a university degree while others do not. In my opinion, everyone should choose what is right for them.",9,band-9-essay-sample-one-should-get-a-university-degree-for-a-good-job
229,Essay topic,"Plenty of translation apps are available for computers and mobile phones. They are quite popular too because many of them are free. This, however, does not mean that they can replace human interpreters or translators because none of the tools available today are able to do justice to their job.
Anyone who has used Google’s translation tools will know why they cannot replace human translators. These tools merely give the meaning of words. They cannot produce sensible sentences. As a result, the meaning often gets lost. Only a human translator can understand the nuances of the language. We have not yet been able to produce apps capable of rivalling humans in this department. Because of this reason, I do not believe that we can do away with human translators.
A piece of text translated by a human translator is not only readable but also enjoyable. The translated work will perhaps fail to create the same impact as the original work. Even so, most of them do justice to the original. Russian and French classics, for example, have been translated into numerous languages. Since few people outside of Russia or France understand these languages, the rest of the world depends on translations of the works of stalwarts like Victor Hugo and Dostoevsky. I admit that their translations were not as good as the original works but they did justice and made characters like Dmitry Karamazov and Jean Val Jean famous all over the world. Had we got these works translated by machines, I am sure no one would have bothered to read them beyond the first page.
Another problem with translation apps is their inability to understand meaning from the context. The same word can have several meanings. If the tool cannot figure out the right meaning, it will create a lot of misunderstanding and confusion. For example, if medical or legal documents are translated by computer apps, the consequences can be disastrous.
To conclude, translation tools that can rival human translators are yet to make their debut. Until then we will need human translators and interpreters.

230,Here is a sample response,"In some countries religion plays an important role in the society. Some campaigns particularly those that hurt religious sentiments are not welcome there. In the same way, some societies are highly conservative and may object to the introduction of western clothing trends into their country. They detest international propaganda.
International marketing campaigns are often designed and executed by businesses in the United States or Europe. They often introduce festivals like Halloween or symbols like Santa Claus in regions that have not even heard about them. For example, the vast majority of Indians or Arabians have not even heard of Halloween. Still, there are brands that try to hard sell this event in these markets. They often organize Halloween themed celebrations in such markets. One can argue that these campaigns give people an opportunity to learn more about foreign events and customs. However, in reality few people actually care about them.
On the flip side, international campaigns have a beneficial and useful side too. They help people learn foreign languages. For example, people all over the world watch events like World Cup Football and Olympics on their television. The commentaries and commercials are usually in English. People watching these events often learn English without even trying to do so. International marketing has also given people an opportunity to become familiar with exotic cuisines. Such campaigns introduced burgers and hot dogs in non-American countries. Such campaigns also helped promote exotic cuisines in Europe and America. Food markets all over the world are now filled up with exotic fruits and vegetables and spices. In all towns and cities one can find restaurants offering a variety of cuisines.
To conclude, international marketing campaigns can be quite invasive and intrusive. However, they also benefit communities in many ways. In my opinion, whether we like them or not we will continue to see these campaigns in the future too.",9,band-9-essay-sample-about-international-marketing
231,"Nowadays children spend a lot of time watching TV and playing computer games. However, it does not help in improving their mental abilities. Do you agree or disagree?","Most children now spend a ridiculous amount of time in front of their TV or computer. They are always glued to their screens. Staring at a screen does not engage the brain. Several studies have shown that when children watch TV or play computer games, their brain activity is minimal. When the brain remains idle for a long time, it affects the intellectual development of the child. Therefore, I agree with the argument that watching TV or playing video games does not improve children’s mental or intellectual skills.
When a child sits for hours staring at a computer screen, very few areas of their brain are activated. By contrast, activities like reading or drawing activates many areas of the brain. Activities that engage the brain improve the intellectual and cognitive skills of the child. Physical activity also helps with brain development.
When children watch TV, they don’t move their limbs much. They don’t even blink. They just stare at the screen. This kind of content consumption is not good for the brain. In fact, studies have shown that children who stay active by engaging in physical activity or creative pursuits like writing, singing or painting are smarter than those who sit in front of their TV for hours on end. All that screen time also causes several health problems in them. For example, they are more likely to be obese. They may even develop diabetes.
To conclude, our bodies and minds are not designed to be idle for long periods. If we keep them idle, our intellectual skills will suffer. Therefore, I agree with the argument that watching TV does not help brain development in children. Our brain is a big muscle. If we work it, it will develop. But if we leave it idle, it will start losing its faculties.",9,band-9-essay-sample-watching-tv-does-not-improve-the-intellectual-skills-of-children
232,"Today, the quality of life in large cities is decreasing.  Discuss the causes and solutions.","Industrilisation and urbanisation have brought opportunity and prosperity albeit at a cost. The quality of life in cities is diminishing. As urban population increases, the complexity of the challenges also increases. Nonetheless, there are several solutions to this problem.
The causes for the decrease in the quality of life are paradoxically the prosperity of metropolitan cities. Cities provide jobs and this makes them more attractive to people. However, the huge influx of migrants eventually leads to a decrease in the quality of life as the city can experience overcrowding, exorbitant property prices, and increased vulnerability to terrorist attacks. For example the density of London makes it more vulnerable to a terrorist attack, when compared to a smaller city such as Bradford. This clearly shows that cities are victims of their own growth and prosperity and urban citizens, especially the poor, often have to be content with a lower quality of life.
As for the solutions, well, greater investment in public transport will ease traffic congestion. Building separate lanes for bikes and cycles will also help. In theory this will reduce air pollution, and possibly improve the health of the population if they adopt a more active lifestyle and cycle to work. To counter violent terrorist attacks, cities could install CCTV cameras to closely monitor the threats. For example, the CCTV cameras in London are said to have foiled many potential attacks, and thus greatly increased the security of its citizens.
To conclude, a wealthy city attracts large influx of people, which then puts pressure on existing infrastructure and security. Various solutions exist to mitigate such drawbacks; nevertheless a permanent solution is yet to be found.

233,"Some people believe that sport competitions are a source of emotional stress for young people. Therefore, youth should be banned from participating in sport competitions. Do you agree or disagree?","Whether it is a sports match or an academic test, competitions are very much a part of life and they cause stress in the participants. Since there is no escape from competition, everyone needs to prepare themselves to deal with the stress and strain associated with it. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the argument that children should be banned from participating in sports competitions.
We cannot achieve anything by banning children from participating in sports events. There is no denying the fact that matches cause stress and tension. This, however, does not mean that forbidding children from participating in these events will solve the problem. A sporting event is much more than a competition. It teaches children a variety of life skills. For instance, they learn to work in a team. They also learn to accept both success and defeat. Actually, several studies have shown that children participating in sporting events enjoy better mental and emotional health. They are better equipped to deal with stressful situations like failures. Such experiences will help them face more stressful situations in the future.
There is yet another benefit to participating in various sporting events. Sports improve physical fitness. When children participate in games like tennis, football or basketball, their fitness levels improve. They become agile and alert. Mental and physical fitness will improve their performance in other areas of life as well.
To conclude, there is no justification for banning children from participating in sporting events. It is true that sporting events cause some stress in the participants. However, not participating in sports is not the solution to this problem. It will only aggravate it.

234,"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be compulsory part of high school programmes (for example working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching to younger children).
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Every nation needs citizens who show social commitment. Since children are the future of a nation, some people believe that they should be required to engage in unpaid community work while they are at school. I strongly agree with this argument. In my opinion, every student should be required to do something for the society. Since many of them are unlikely to have the inclination to do so on their own, making it compulsory is the only way out.
When school students engage in community service, they get to learn a lot of life skills. They learn to be empathetic. When they help poor or disabled people, they learn to appreciate their own life. They realize that they have got many things that other people don’t have. Working with or working for less fortunate people is a great way to understand the meaning of one’s own life.
There is yet another reason for making social work compulsory. Nowadays children are becoming too full of themselves. They have little time for others. They are constantly glued to their smart phones or gaming consoles. In most cases, making community service an integral part of the school curriculum is the only way to get them engaged in social work. The best part is that once they become involved in social causes they will begin to enjoy helping others. When they realize that their work makes a difference to another person’s life, they will begin to like it.
Another important benefit of engaging in community service is that it provides children an opportunity to improve their communication skills. When they interact with people from all walks of life, they learn a lot of coping skills as well.
To conclude, students who engage in unpaid community service reap a lot of benefits. Since few students have the natural drive for social work, making it compulsory is the only way to get them engaged in social work. Therefore, I agree with the argument that community service should be a compulsory part of school curriculum.

235,"Some people claim that governments should take action to ensure that people have a healthy lifestyle. Others, however, disagree and believe that people should decide themselves which way they prefer to live their lives.","In a democracy people have the freedom to decide what they should eat or drink. They have the freedom to decide how they should lead their lives. The government can encourage people to lead healthy lives, but it cannot decide what people have on their plate. Any such move by the government will amount to the violation of the fundamental rights of its citizens.
If a nation is to prosper, its people have to be healthy. Therefore, it is normal for governments to be concerned about their citizens’ health. This, however, does not mean that governments can promote a certain lifestyles and ban others. People must be allowed to make their own choices.
When print and visual media give information on healthy and unhealthy food habits and lifestyle, people should have no difficulty making the right choices. Parents can also help their children to choose the right foods. If people still decide to live an unhealthy lifestyle, they are doing so at their own risk.
Ill-health is not always a result of poor food habits. In many cases, it is a consequence of poverty. Poor people still do not have access to good food and sanitation. This is where the government needs to step in. The government can, for example, ensure that everyone has access to nutritious foods by offering food grains at subsidized rates. Malnutrition is still a big problem in undeveloped countries where millions of children go to bed on an empty stomach. By giving food grains free or at subsidized costs, the government can ensure that every child can grow into a healthy adult.
To conclude, I strongly believe that people should be allowed to make their own food and lifestyle choices. The government should encourage them to lead healthy lives by creating awareness through various channels. It also needs to ensure that everyone has access to good food regardless of their financial situation. In my opinion, apart from this, the government has no other role to perform in this situation.

236,Many countries spend too much money on training of a few individuals for international sports competitions. Some people think that governments should invest more in ordinary people instead. Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and examples.,"There is no denying the fact that governments need to invest in ordinary people. This, however, doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t spend money on nurturing the talents of young men and women who have an aptitude for sports and games. If these athletes manage to deliver superior performance at international events like Olympics, they will bring glory to their motherland.
When athletes from nations like the United States and China fared spectacularly well in the recently concluded Rio Olympics, they gave plenty of reasons for their countrymen to rejoice. They ignited values like nationalism and patriotism. Events like Olympics give nations an opportunity to showcase their talent in front of an international audience. When players perform well in international events, it is a matter of pride for their nation. Likewise, when they perform badly, their country loses its face.
India, for example, is a nation of over a billion people. Still, the country has not been able to produce many world champions. India’s performance at the Rio Olympics was pitiable and caused a great deal of distress to Indians. Indian athletes’ poor performance at the Olympics is often attributed to the lack of adequate training facilities in the country. Unlike China, Indian government doesn’t spend too much on their athletes and this reflects in their lackluster performance. Their poor performance at Rio was a cause of shame for the entire nation and forced authorities to analyse the situation.
To conclude, the bunch of athletes who represent a nation at international events are much more than a few individuals. They represent the entire nation. They carry the hopes and aspirations of their nation on their shoulders. Their performance brings glory to their motherland and improves its standing among world nations. Therefore, I strongly believe that the government needs to hone their skills by providing them adequate facilities.

237,Nowadays children are consuming too many sugar-based drinks. What are the reasons and the solutions for this situation?,"Sugar-based drinks give an instant energy boost. They are also tasty. These are the main reasons that made sugary drinks popular among children and youngsters. Unfortunately, these drinks are not healthy and pose a major threat to the health of young people.
Sugary drinks are becoming more and more popular because they are readily available. Even in villages, there are shops that sell these instant energy boosters. These drinks are also heavily marketed. Manufacturers rope in national and international celebrities and sports personalities to endorse these products on television and in newspapers. If a famous sportsperson says that a certain drink is the secret of his health, his young fans are bound to believe it. Consequently, they start using the drink themselves. Another reason behind the popularity of these drinks is that they are addictive. They contain ingredients that make children addicted to them. The same ingredients also elevate energy levels and enhance mood.
Excessive consumption of sugary drinks can have long term health consequences. These drinks are high in calories, but they don’t offer any nutrition. Regular consumption of sugar-based drinks can result in obesity and diabetes. Actually, we are already seeing a dramatic increase in the number of children suffering from these health problems.
These are several ways to deal with this situation. Creating awareness among children about the negative effects of sugary drinks may or may not have the desired results because few children are actually worried about health. A better strategy is to limit their availability or make them unaffordable by increasing taxes on them. The government also needs to ensure that commercials of such drinks are not aired during prime time when children are likely to be in front of the TV. Parental control is important too. Parents should resist the temptation to buy high calorie drinks for their children.
To conclude, a lot of factors have contributed to the popularity of sugary drinks. Limiting their availability or making them less appealing or affordable may help to counter this problem.",9,band-9-essay-sample-children-are-consuming-too-many-sugary-drinks
238,"Cycling has many benefits, yet in some countries there is a decrease in the number of people using bicycles as their main form of transportation. Why is it happening? Give suggestions how to encourage people to use bicycles again.","Cycling has several health benefits. It is also an environment friendly means of transport. Even so, cycling is becoming less and less popular. There are several reasons for this.
First, there are no dedicated lanes for cyclists in most towns and cities. Cycling on a busy road is a dangerous activity. Even bikes are not safe in cities. When our cities and towns are not cycle-friendly, we cannot blame people for not using cycles. If there are dedicated lanes for cyclists, I am sure a lot of people living in urban areas will switch to this mode of traveling. It should be noted that cycling is still very popular in countries like China where the right infrastructure exists.
Second, cycling is not suitable for long distance travel. Unlike driving, cycling is a strenuous activity. Cycles can only be used for traveling short distances. This is another factor that worked against cycles.
Third, cycling is not considered as ‘cool’. A cycle serves more or less the same purpose as a motorbike. It is much cheaper and doesn’t require any fuel. Still, people ditch their bicycles and buy bikes if they can afford them. The fact that a cycle is an inexpensive vehicle makes it less fashionable or attractive. This might sound strange but it is true.
To conclude, several factors have contributed to the waning popularity of cycling. Cycling is healthy but it is not exactly safe especially in cities where the traffic is heavy. If the government wants to promote cycling, the first thing it needs to do is to create separate lanes for cyclists.",9,ielts-essay-sample-why-is-cycling-becoming-less-popular
239,Many countries increase the amount of household garbage going to landfill every year. What are the causes? What can be done to reduce it?,"Over the last few years there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of garbage produced by each household. All of this eventually ends up in the landfill. Overflowing landfills have become a major health hazard. They pollute the land, air and water. Several factors have contributed to the increase in garbage production.
Consumerism is on the rise. Societies all over the world are becoming more and more materialistic. We are buying stuff without even wondering whether we actually need it or not. One of the reasons behind this trend is the increase in household incomes. As families become richer, their spending on consumables also increases. They are amassing things and when their cupboards overflow, they just throw them away.
Gone are the days when we used to reuse items until they wear out. Use and throw – that is the latest trend. Buy it. Use it once and then throw it away. From bottles to nappies, we are now living in the age of disposables. Take for, instance, the case of nappies. A child uses tens of thousands of nappies before she turns three. All of these end up in the landfills.
The only way to reduce this problem is to create awareness about the environmental impacts of our actions. We need to realize that throwing stuff away is no longer a fashionable thing to do. We must realize the environmental impacts of our actions and make a conscious effort to reduce our carbon footprint. One way of doing this is to produce less waste. Both the government and the media can create awareness among the people about the dangers of overflowing landfills.

240,"Some people believe that subjects such as art, music, drama and creative writing have a bright future. Therefore, schools should spend more time teaching these subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Schools already provide some training in subjects like dance, music and creative writing. These ‘extracurricular’ classes help students discover their innate talent for these subjects. Some people believe that these subjects should be given greater importance in the school curriculum because they have a bright future. I don’t agree with this view. In my opinion, subjects like these should be optional because few students have an aptitude for them.
Not all students are supposed to be artists, singers or writers. Such careers require inborn talents. While it is possible to acquire a taste for these subjects by learning them at school, it is not enough to build a bright future in these fields. That also explains why schools set aside only a few hours to teach these subjects. Those who have a talent for them can gain professional training from dedicated institutions after school. In every city, it is not hard to find institutes providing special training in dance or drama. Students who have a flair for these subjects and who are keen on building a career in them can attend those institutes.
Arts and stories entertain us; however, they are not crucial to our existence. By contrast, subjects like maths and science have greater applications in life. The world certainly needs more doctors and engineers than singers or painters. Also, a large number of students show proficiency in these ‘intellectual’ subjects. The truth is that anyone can become a doctor or engineer if they are willing to work hard. By contrast, very few can become a Michelangelo or Beethoven.
To conclude, I don’t agree with the argument that schools should put greater emphasis on subjects like arts and drama. These subjects require inborn talents and few students possess them.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Climate change has started threatening our very existence on this planet. The soaring temperatures have already caused the extinction of many species. Some people feel that it is difficult or impossible to stop climate change. In their opinion, we need to find ways to live with it. I disagree with this view because climate change can be prevented to a great extent. And when it can be prevented we do not have to find ways to live with it.
The argument that instead of preventing climate change we need to explore alternative ways to live with it shows our unwillingness to change our irresponsible ways. We need to accept the fact that climate change didn’t happen on its own. It was triggered by our actions. Since the days of industrialization we have been consuming natural resources without thinking about the consequences of our actions. When we burn fossil fuels, we are producing many gases that increase global warming. The last decade saw a dramatic increase in the number of vehicles on the road. All of them emit dangerous carbon dioxide. Refrigerators and air conditioners are now found in almost all homes. They also produce greenhouse gases. Unfortunately, what we do to reduce the heat inside our homes and offices increases global warming. This is a vicious cycle and we must get out of it.
The best way to reduce climate change is to use our resources responsibly. We need to invest in alternative energy sources like solar and wind. In addition, the government should encourage people to use public transport systems. Imposing ‘green taxes’ on private vehicles and airlines could be a step in the right direction. Everyone needs to make a conscious effort to reduce their carbon footprint by consuming less energy. Both the government and the media need to create awareness about the growing threat caused by rising temperatures and changing climate.
To conclude, there are several ways to prevent climate change and hence the argument that we need to find ways to cope with it does not hold water.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Modern technology has made our lives easier; however, technology like everything else has its advantages and disadvantages. Some people feel that technology has resulted in unemployment. I don’t quite agree with this statement.
A few decades ago, robots were merely a science fiction concept, but now they have started controlling many aspects of our lives. Technology has made many jobs redundant. In a matter of minutes a computer can perform tasks that will take a human being several days to complete.
Unemployment rates in the 21st century are somewhat higher than what it was a couple of decades ago. Inventors are working hard to build new machines and robots. Machines save labour and reduce the cost of production. Self-checkout machines installed in supermarkets have replaced cashiers. A lot of us now perform banking transactions online. We withdraw money from cash machines. As a result, many banks have stopped recruiting new employees. Even existing employees are being laid off.
Now let’s take a look at the other side of the coin. Automation has resulted in the loss of several jobs. It has also created many jobs because machines need people to operate them. Factories manufacturing computers, cell phones and ATM machines employ tens of thousands of people. These jobs were not available a few decades ago. The truth is that automation has created new professions. Machines require regular maintenance. Computers need operators and programmers. Teachers and instructors who show people how machines should be used are also in huge demand. What’s more, machines have enhanced our productivity and eliminated costly and dangerous errors.

What can be done to improve the situation?,"Fashion and lifestyle magazines are promoting unrealistic and impossible beauty standards. Wafer thin models adorn billboards all over the world. As a result, many people, especially teens now equate beauty with thinness. They refuse to eat because they are worried that they will become fat. In medical parlance, this disorder is called anorexia and it has become a major cause for concern.
Food is our fuel. If our body does not receive the right amounts of nutrients, it will not be able to function properly. Nutritional supplements can never be a substitute for food. Studies have shown that vitamins and minerals that the body receives through supplements are not absorbed properly. By contrast, the body can easily absorb the nutrients in foods. This undermines the importance of eating right.
While anorexia can be considered as a psychological disorder, it is a byproduct of our obsession with beauty and thinness. Fashion magazines and designers have their own reasons to promote thinness. If everyone is of the same size, it helps the mass production of clothes and other accessories. This will increase their profits. Unfortunately, teens who adulate super thin models and who refuse to eat do not realize that they are doing a disservice to their body.
Creating awareness about this menace is the first step to stop it. The government and the media can do a lot. In my opinion, the government needs to ban publications and commercials that promote impossible and unhealthy standards of beauty. Parents need to be vigilant too. They can easily spot the eating disorders in their children. If they feel that their children are not eating properly, they should consult a doctor and a counselor. Anorexia is not an incurable condition. Youngsters who are counseled against its ill-effects are more likely to adopt healthy eating habits.
To conclude, creating awareness about health and beauty is the first step towards combating anorexia. Youngsters need to realize that thinness is a sign of malnutrition, and not beauty. The government, doctors, media and parents need to make a concerted effort to dispel myths surrounding beauty.",9,ielts-essay-about-anorexia-its-causes-and-possible-solutions
244,"In many countries governments spend a lot of money on internet infrastructure. Some say it is reasonable to allocate these funds, but others disagree and say that many more important programs need this money. Discuss both views, give your opinion and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Most countries now spend a great deal of money on developing internet infrastructure and promoting internet penetration. In my opinion, this is justified because the internet has the potential to bring about rapid changes and developments in the society. Of course, the governments have to take care of a lot of other things as well. This, however, does not mean that they should reduce their spending on the internet and information technology.
The internet has revolutionised our lives. Having access to an internet connection is a bit like having access to all the information in the world. The internet allows students to prepare for their examinations and youngsters to find employment. It keeps people connected to their near and dear ones and can act as a savior in a calamity. Because of its always-on nature, the internet allows people to share news and information in real time.
The internet empowers people. By giving them access to vital information, it makes them aware of their rights. It provides opportunities to people living in remote areas or villages. The internet has created countless jobs directly and indirectly and allows people to work freelance. Perhaps, no other invention has had such a tremendous impact on our lives during the last twenty years.
The internet acts as a leveler. By giving internet access to the poor and depressed sections of the society, the government can bring them to the mainstream and ensure their participation in growth and development.
To conclude, the internet has the potential to create jobs and economic development. In my opinion, therefore, the government spending on the internet is justified.",9,ielts-essay-sample-should-the-governments-spend-a-lot-of-money-on-developing-internet-infrastructure
245,Nowadays many young people are drawn towards dangerous sports. What makes them so attractive? What measures should be taken to regulate such sports and minimize the risks?,"Nowadays youngsters are showing too much interest in extreme sports. They don’t care about their safety. They just want to experience the thrill and adrenaline rush. Unfortunately, a lot of them injure themselves while engaging in dangerous sports. There are several reasons behind the popularity of extreme sports.
Young people, especially teens, seek appreciation. They want to show off their courage and skills. They enjoy posting photos of their daring acts on social media. They want to get as many comments and likes as they can. A lot of them also enjoy the thrill and excitement that they get to experience while performing these activities. For example, my friend shared a photo of him trying bungee-jumping on social media. It was his first attempt and he received a lot of appreciation from his friends. I am sure he will repeat the act.
Dangerous sports are just that – dangerous. Accidents often occur and cause serious injuries to the participants. I recently read in an article that a girl had fallen from the top of a giant wheel and died.
Banning adventurous sports probably does not make sense because people have a right to engage in activities that they enjoy. Most people who participate in these activities are aware of the risks they are taking. However, the government needs to control and regularise the sector. Only licensed companies should be allowed to operate in this field. Violators should be punished with monetary fines and/or prison terms. Parents too can play an important role here. They should not allow their children to engage in activities that are dangerous to their lives.
To conclude, people have a fundamental right to pursue activities that they enjoy as long as they do not cause harm to themselves or others. Young people seek fun and thrill. They government can’t prevent them from engaging in adventurous activities; however, it should enact appropriate laws to ensure the safety of the participants.",9,ielts-essay-about-youngsters-and-adventurous-sports
246,The modern family structure and roles of each member have changed in the recent years. Do you think it has a negative or a positive effect on families? Give your opinion and relevant examples.,"Until a few decades ago, men were the providers and women were the care givers. Men would go out to work and earn money. Women would stay at home looking after children and cooking food. This arrangement is disappearing and in my opinion it is a positive trend.
In many families, now both spouses work and earn money. This is particularly true in developed and developing nations. This trend has changed the structure of families and the role of family members. Men are no longer seen as the only bread winners. In some families, women earn more than men do. They deserve equal treatment.
Working women expect their partners to share the household responsibilities with them. They want their husbands to help them with the kids and housework. Most men are willing to lend a helping hand. Many of them never saw their dads doing the dishes or dusting the furniture, but now they do it happily because their women are also busy with their careers.
As more and more women become financially independent, the role of family members will change. Modern women have carved a niche for themselves in almost every sector. They now work and earn. Naturally they deserve equal treatment and respect. Men who still have age-old notions of male supremacy may find it difficult to come to terms with the change of roles. However, those who think practically have certainly changed their attitudes and support their women in their career and at home.
To conclude, women’s empowerment is the reason behind this change in the structure of families. Women no longer want to confine themselves to the four walls of their home. As they have started working outside, traditional definitions of husbands and wives have changed. Men are no longer the only breadwinners and women are no longer the only care givers. In my opinion, this is a positive trend that has the potential to make our world a better place where both men and women command equal respect.",9,ielts-essay-sample-the-structure-of-families-and-roles-of-family-members-are-changing
247,Some people believe that the government should help the unemployed ona weekly basis. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion.,"Unemployment is becoming a major problem all over the world. Even in some developed nations, the rate of unemployment is high. This is sometimes attributed to the financial recession that gripped the world during the first decade of this century. While the situation improved considerably over the last few years, a lot of people who had been laid off by their previous employers are still out of work. Some people feel that the government should give them weekly financial allowances. I don’t think that this is a viable solution.
To start with, if governments were to provide financial assistance to every unemployed person, they would have little money to run the country. Most nations already have several welfare schemes for the jobless and the governments certainly offer some financial assistance through these schemes. Of course, these nominal financial aids are unlikely to solve the financial woes of the jobless. I won’t blame the governments for these because there is a limit to the amount of money they can spend.
In most cases unemployment is the result of the lack of skills. People who possess skills that the industry demands will have no difficulty finding jobs. Yes, the recession wiped away many jobs. However, there are still several sectors that need skilled manpower. Instead of doling out financial assistance to jobless people, the government should run free training programs and camps where the jobless can pick up skills. This will provide a lasting solution to this problem.
The government should also create awareness about the dignity of labour. The unemployment rates in India are high. This is not really caused by the dearth of job. Rather it is a result of misplaced notions of dignity. The educated middle class Indians will only accept white collar jobs. If the jobless take up manual jobs, the nation will become much more prosperous.
To conclude, giving weekly financial assistance to the jobless will not increase the GDP of a nation. It is never a solution. Instead of giving people money, the government should provide free training that will increase their employability.",9,band-9-essay-sample-should-governments-provide-weekly-financial-assistance-to-the-jobless
248,"Nowadays the differences between countries are becoming less evident because we see the same TV shows, advertisements, fashion and follow the same brands. To what extent the advantages of this trend outweigh its disadvantages?","We are now living in a global village where geographical barriers have become insignificant. All over the world, people wear the same kind of clothes, eat the same foods and watch the same films. In my opinion, this trend has made life easier for us all.
There are several benefits to following global fashion trends. It makes traveling easier. For example, now Indians and Americans or Europeans have more or less the same tastes in fashion, food and music. As a result, young Indian professionals can travel to the US or Europe and still feel at home there.
The biggest advantage of following a global lifestyle is that it eliminates culture shock when you travel to other countries. It also protects you from discrimination. When you wear the same kind of clothes or eat the same kind of foods as everyone else, you will not stand out. This will actually protect you from various forms of discrimination that you might experience when you are in a foreign country. An Indian woman living in the US will be at a disadvantage if she insists on wearing only traditional Indian clothes and eating only vegetarian foods. This will limit the choices she has, but if she is willing to follow the culture of the country she lives in, life will be easier for her.
The only disadvantage of this trend is the loss of ethnicity. Every nation has its traditional styles of fashion and clothing. When everyone wears the same kind of clothes, this cultural legacy gets lost.
To conclude, the benefits of following global trends in lifestyle and fashion are many. It makes life easier for the globetrotting youngsters. There are, nonetheless, a few disadvantages, but there is an easy way to get around them. People who are proud of their ethnic fashion and lifestyle can follow it when they are in their own country.",9,band-9-essay-sample-everyone-now-wears-the-same-kinds-of-clothes-and-eats-the-same-food-is-this-a-positive-trend
249,"Nowadays there is a rapid increase in the use of natural resources such as oil, forest and fresh water. What dangers does it bring? What are the possible solutions to address these issues?","The world is becoming hungrier for resources. We have already destroyed much of the forest cover and depleted fresh water sources. Oil wells are drying up. In my opinion, excessive consumption of natural resources will have long lasting consequences that will even endanger our existence on this planet.
Human population increased rapidly over the last few decades. Increasing population puts strain on natural resources like forests. Forests are being cleared to build homes and factories. Trees are being cut down to build furniture. Unfortunately, deforestation leads to several problems like increase in atmospheric temperature, droughts and soil erosion. When temperature rises people buy air conditioners. This does not address the issue. In fact, some chemicals released by refrigerators and air conditioners add to global warming.
Depleting oil resources can wreak havoc with global economy. Oil is the biggest source of energy for the developed and developing world. Over 90 percent of vehicles run on petrol and diesel. If oil disappears one day, people will not be able to travel. All transportation activities will come to a stop and people will not have access to essential commodities.
Fresh water is another resource that is fast becoming unavailable. It is impossible to survive without fresh water. It is true that plenty of water is available in the oceans, but ocean water cannot be used for drinking. While it is possible to desalinate ocean water, this process requires a great deal of energy.
To conclude depleting natural resources are the biggest problem we face today. The only possible solution is to invest in renewable energy sources. We also need to learn to use resources judiciously. Even simple acts like planting trees and saving rain water will make a great difference.",9,ielts-essay-about-excessive-consumption-of-natural-resources
250,Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer languages promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.,"Each year many languages around the world die because people are adopting some international dialects that are widely spoken. Whether this is a positive development or a negative development is debatable.
Some people believe that fewer languages will promote better harmony and understanding. This is true to a certain extent. We feel an immediate connection to people who speak our own language. If all of us spoke the same language, the world would definitely be a better place to live in. People will be able to travel to any part of the world and conduct business. When language barriers disappear a lot of conflicts will also disappear. In other words, a world where just one language is spoken is more likely to be a world filled with peace and harmony. Tourism will also flourish and lead to economic development.
On the flip side, when a language dies the culture associated with it also dies. The wealth of knowledge and information contained in the literature of that knowledge will become inaccessible to future generations. This is not a positive development. Archeologists have unearthed stone carvings and artefacts from various parts of the world. They still have not been able to decipher many of these inscriptions because those languages have died and no one can read them now.
In the modern world, where we have access to sophisticated transportation and communication tools, we probably need only one language. This, however, does not mean that we should let languages die. Language is the reflection of a culture. We can’t let it die. In addition to our mother tongue, maybe we can all learn a more popular language like English for business and travel purposes.
To conclude, one language will definitely bring us closer to the concept of one world. However, in my opinion, every nation and every society that respects their culture and heritage has a responsibility to protect their languages.",9,ielts-essay-sample-languages-are-dying-around-the-world-is-this-a-positive-development
251,Many people try to look younger than they really are. What are the reasons for that? Is it a positive or negative development?,"These days, no one wants to look their age. Actually, we are so madly in love with eternal youth that we try every trick in the book to look younger and more attractive. In my opinion, this trend has both positive and negative aspects.
A lot of factors have encouraged people to pursue eternal youth. Marketing is the most important of them. We are now living in the age of information explosion. Every second we are getting bombarded with images of good looking men and women who never seem to age. They are everywhere – on the billboards, in the newspapers, on television and the internet. There is no escaping them. Marketers, especially those working in the beauty industry, are responsible for creating the impossible beauty standards that we struggle to live up to. Everyone wants to look like the model on the billboard or the TV commercial. Needless to say people are spending huge amounts of money on cosmetics and other beauty treatments. Procedures like Botox have become household names.
Of course, this trend has some positive effects. When people become conscious of their looks, they start paying attention to their body and its needs. They make a conscious effort to eat well. This improves their overall health. Good looks may also improve their confidence.
On the flip side, impossible beauty standards also develop inferiority complex in people who cannot attain them. A lot of us overlook the fact that the models in commercials are actually photoshopped to look younger and prettier. By aspiring to look like them, we aren’t doing ourselves any service. Also, some products that we apply on our skin and hair have serious side effects. Unfortunately, in the mad rush to look younger, we ignore the side effects of many beauty treatments.
To conclude, the concepts of beauty and aging have changed over the years. Today, no one believes in aging gracefully. Impossible beauty standards are the creation of marketers and visual media has helped in their massive adoption. While this trend isn’t completely bad, it has some serious repercussions.",9,ielts-essay-about-people-wanting-to-look-younger
252,Computer technology has had more of a negative impact than a positive impact on the society? How far do you agree with this statement? Support your views with reasons and/or examples from your own experience.,"Every coin has two sides; computer technology is no different. However, I can’t agree with the argument that its disadvantages outweigh its advantages. Yes, there are some negative aspects, but in my opinion, there are many more positive aspects.
Computers and the internet have made us more efficient. Today huge amounts of information are available online. If we have a computer and an internet connection we can access the whole of this information from anywhere in the world. The internet has made it possible for us to stay connected to our near and dear ones all the time. It has made it possible for people to work from their home and get paid. Thanks to the internet, we can now learn foreign languages without leaving our country.
Computers have increased our efficiency. We can now perform more tasks in less time. Jobs that took weeks or months 20 or 30 years ago can now be done in a matter of hours. Computer technology also allows doctors to diagnose diseases more accurately. It helps us to predict natural calamities and save lives.
There are some drawbacks as well. People’s privacy often gets violated on the internet. Also, in the recent past there have been several incidents of hacking. Malicious software programs like viruses can infect computers and compromise the personal and financial information of the user. However, in most cases, these problems can be controlled with a little effort. For example, by installing anti-virus programs on their computer, people can protect their computers from malware and spyware.
To conclude, computers and the internet have improved our lives in many ways. There are some negative impacts as well, but they cannot be a hindrance for the positive development of mankind.",9,ielts-essay-sample-computer-technology-has-more-of-a-negative-impact-than-a-positive-impact-on-the-society-do-you-agree
253,"Some cities do not restrict how big,  stylish and unique houses and offices that people construct can be. Do you think the advantages of this approach outweigh the disadvantages?","However, in other places, there are hardly any reasons to build homes and offices of the same kind. Buildings that look unique make cities visually appealing. Also, these structures can serve as landmarks. I possess limited spatial skills. If I have to find my way through a city where all buildings look alike, I will have a tough time.
There is a downside to this. If people are allowed to build homes of whatever designs they like, they might be tempted to show off their wealth. This already happens in a prosperous state like Kerala. Anyone who has been to this South Indian state couldn’t have missed the palatial homes that dot its landscape. In Kerala, like in many other parts of India, people can build homes of any size and design. Unfortunately, this has created rivalry between neighbours. Everyone wants their home to be the best and the biggest. This obsession with building the biggest home in the neighbourhood has actually led to the depletion of natural resources in this state.
To conclude, there are both merits and demerits to imposing restrictions on the size and design of homes and offices that people can build. In my opinion, people should be allowed to choose the design of their home in areas that do not belong to the heritage category. The government should, however, impose some restrictions on the size of homes. People must not be allowed to build excessively large homes just to show off their wealth.",9,ielts-essay-should-people-be-allowed-to-build-homes-of-whatever-design-and-size-they-prefer
254,Some people believe all children should be taught together. Others say that they should be separated according to academic abilities. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In most schools fast learners and slow learners are taught together. Some people are against this arrangement. In their opinion, there should be separate classes for academically brilliant and academically poor students. I don’t agree with this view.
When students are separated on the basis of their academic skills it affects their self-esteem. Academically weak students may develop an inferiority complex which will further affect their performance. Worse, the brilliant students may look down upon them. While it is possible to argue that this arrangement will help the performance of both categories of students, in my opinion, the benefits are negligible.
Just because we put slow learners in a separate class, it will not improve their academic performance automatically. They will still have to work harder; teachers will still have to spend more time explaining the concepts. So, I don’t see what the advantages are. In fact, the presence of slow learners in a class has little impact on the performance of brilliant students. Of course, teachers will take more time to teach the lessons; however, they will still manage to cover the portions before the test. In most cases, this will mean paying less attention to slow learners, but the situation isn’t going to be any better in classes for slow learners either. Teachers are required to complete the lessons before the test. They can’t waste time on any student.
In my opinion, instead of separating the students the school should organize extra classes for the slow learners. This arrangement will have a better impact on their performance. Teachers have less time to work with slow learners during regular classes as they are under pressure to complete the lessons. If there are extra classes, they will be able to explain concepts in more detail and solve doubts.
To conclude, separating students on the basis of their academic skills is unlikely to have any positive impact on their performance. Worse, this arrangement might make slow learners feel inferior. In my opinion, a better solution is to arrange extra classes for them.",9,band-9-essay-sample-should-students-be-separated-on-the-basis-of-their-academic-performance
255,"For a long time there has been concern about the quality of the food we eat because of additives and contaminants. Recently genetically modified (GM) food has become more common, causing concern. Is this concern justified or not?","People are getting more and more concerned about the quality of food they eat. The rich and the famous have already switched to organic foods. Such foods are costly and nutritious. Unfortunately, few people can afford them. Those who cannot afford to buy organic foods are also making a conscious effort to choose foods wisely. They refuse to buy foods containing additives and preservatives. Some of them are also against genetically modified foods. They are worried that GM foods might cause diseases like cancer. However, till date, we haven’t got anything to prove that GM foods cause cancer.
GM foods have been around for over 20 years. Contrary to popular belief these foods have not been linked to cancer or another disease. There have been several studies, but none managed to prove that GM crops cause cancer.
Organic foods are certainly healthier than GM foods, but their affordability is an issue. Organic foods don’t contain pesticides. Since pesticides are not used, their yield per hectare is low. Because of these reasons organic foods are way beyond the reach of common man. By contrast GM foods are cheaper. GM plants are resistant to droughts, floods and pests. They can be grown using very little water. Also, they can resist pests. They provide better yields and hence prices are low.
Over the last few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in world population. The world population is expected to reach 8 billion within the next few years. When there is an increase in population, the need for food also increases. In such a scenario, the only practical solution is to grow more GM foods. Unless our scientists find a healthier and cheaper option, GM foods are here to stay.
To conclude, people have the freedom to decide what they should eat. If they are particularly concerned about GM foods, they don’t have to eat such foods. However, in my opinion, these fears are baseless. Many people simply overlook the major benefits of GM foods and instead focus on their unproven negative effects.",9,band-9-essay-about-gm-foods
256,Some parents buy their children a large number of toys to play with. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having a large number of toys? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Compared to the past, children now have more toys. In my opinion, having more toys is beneficial to the overall development of the child. However, too many toys may also cause some problems.
Age appropriate toys help the mental and physical development of the child. There are many life lessons that children can learn from their toys. For example, when kids play with balls, they learn to share. Spider Man is the role model for many children. Since this fictitious character fights the bad guys and saves the virtuous, children who adore him also learn the importance of being good and fighting injustice.
Toys also teach children to be responsible. Girls all over the world love their Barbie Dolls. They wake the doll up in the morning, comb her hairs and dress her with beautiful clothes. This way they are learning to take care of others. Toys also offer companionship. Many families now have only one child. Toys make children feel less lonely when their parents are away.
Parents’ habit of buying too many toys for their children has certain disadvantages too. To start with, children who have too many toys to play with will have hardly any interest in maintaining them. They know they will get another toy if they break one. Bad toys can also cause behavioural problems in kids. Guns, for example, can make children aggressive. Children who played with toy weapons during their childhood may as well acquire a real weapon when they grow up.
To conclude, there is no harm in buying more toys for children. Children who get to play with a large number of age appropriate toys are more likely to have better cognitive skills. They are also less likely to develop depression. However, choosing the right toys is extremely important. Parents need to ensure that the toys that they buy will have no negative impact on their children.",9,ielts-essay-about-parents-buying-too-many-toys-for-their-children
257,Everyday traffic seems to get worse on our roads. How can we reduce the number of cars on our roads today? What alternatives can we offer car drivers?,"Over the years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of vehicles on the road. This has reduced the quality of air in major cities. Vehicular pollution also leads to several health problems. Obviously, this is a major problem that needs to be solved.
If we really want to control air pollution, we need to reduce the number of cars on the road. This is not possible without proper legislation. In some countries, a family can own only one car. In my opinion, governments all over the world should enact similar laws. If we can prevent rich families from buying more and more cars, we will be able to reduce the number of vehicles on the road.
Controlling car ownership alone will not solve the problem. Cars have a shelf life. Older cars cause more pollution than newer cars. So, we also need legislation that forbids people from driving vehicles older than 10 years. Creating awareness among the public is equally important. People need to be made aware of the environmental impact of vehicles.
Legislation won’t fix the problem if there are no viable alternatives. Fortunately, plenty of them exist. Public transport is the alternative to private cars. The government should invest more money in public transport systems. If buses and trains arrive on time, very few people will want to drive to work. Carpooling and cycling are also good solutions. We also need to develop cities where people can walk to work.
To conclude, we must control vehicular congestion and pollution before the situation goes out of control. It is evident that we require new legislation and regulations to control this situation. We must also opt for better alternatives like public transport and cycling.",9,band-9-essay-sample-how-to-reduce-the-number-of-cars-on-the-road
258,"Some people say that distance learning is a quick and effective way to study. Others, however, disagree and say that distance learning programs can never be as good as courses taken in person. Do you agree or disagree with the statement?","Distance learning programs have become quite popular in recent years. People who can’t afford to enroll in a fulltime program because of work commitments or other issues choose distance programs to further their education. It is true that distance programs have many benefits; however, in my opinion they are not as effective as regular programs.
The workplace is becoming more and more competitive. In order to get ahead, employees have to obtain more degrees. Since distance learning allows employed people to complete their course work at their convenience, they are a boon to working people. Distance courses are also cheaper than fulltime courses. In addition, they eliminate the need to commute. These are obviously the positive aspects.
However, distance learning programs still do not enjoy the same status as full time programs. Employers often prefer candidates who attended a course in person. There are several benefits to learning in person. When someone attends a class and learns from a professor in person, it becomes easier for them to digest the concepts. In addition, real classrooms provide ample opportunities to interact with other students. This also enhances learning. It is not surprising that students who complete a full time program have deeper understanding of the concepts.
There is no denying the fact that distance learning programs are quick and easy; however, they have several inherent disadvantages too. For example, only those students who demonstrate excellent willpower will be able to complete these programs. As there is no one to monitor progress, learning can become difficult and affect the student’s morale.
To conclude, while I certainly agree that distance learning programs are useful, in my opinion they are not as effective as full time programs.",9,ielts-essay-are-distance-learning-programs-as-effective-as-full-time-programs
259,All over the world societies are facing a growing problem with obesity. Obesity affects both children and adults. What are the reasons for this rise in obesity? How can it be tackled?,"Obesity is one of the biggest health problems that we face today. Obese people are more likely to develop diabetes, heart problems and strokes. Obesity affects children as well as adults. In this essay, I will explain the causes of obesity and suggest ways to tackle it.
Obesity is a byproduct of our modern lifestyle. Everybody is busy now. No one has the time or mind to cook proper meals. So we buy packaged foods that are high in calories, additives and preservatives. Many families now subsist of pizzas, burgers, chips, cheese and fish. They don’t eat fruits or vegetables.
Another cause of obesity is the sedentary lifestyle that most of us lead. Our jobs don’t require us to get physically active. After sitting for hours in front of a computer, we go home to sit many more hours in front of the television. As a result, we don’t get any opportunities to burn the calories that we consume.
The government can discourage people from eating fast foods by spreading awareness about the health problems caused by them and by increasing the taxes on them. When high taxes are imposed on packaged foods, they will become unaffordable to many people. This will reduce their consumption. Employers can also help. They should equip workplaces with gyms so that employees can work out. A quick workout will improve their energy levels and efficiency.
To conclude, obesity is a serious health problem. The only way to solve this problem is to make appropriate changes to our lifestyle. People should be encouraged to get physically active and reduce their consumption of fatty foods. The governments and the media can play an importance role in creating awareness about the ill effects of obesity.

260,"When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive.","There is a common belief that technological advancements have made many traditional skills and practices irrelevant today. Modernization has certainly changed the way we live. However, I don’t think that technology has killed tradition.
We don’t want to live in caves just because our ancestors did so. Technology has certainly made such ways of life obsolete and I feel that it is a positive development. If technology develops, that is because people want it to develop. All the facilities and amenities that we enjoy today are the products of technological advancement. If there was no technology we would still be living in caves, hunting animals for food.
Technology cannot or will not change traditional ways of living if people want to preserve them. We can find examples of this in societies all over the world. For example, my grandmother still makes pickles in the traditional way. She doesn’t use preservatives although they are readily available now. Likewise, my mother still cooks fish curry in clay pots. She likes to wear handmade saris although machine made saris are also available today. India still has a booming handloom industry. These are all examples of how people preserve their traditions. Just because the world has advanced technologically, nobody is forcing people to change their way of life. They embrace change only when they want to do.
Now if we look at this from another angle it is not hard to see that modern appliances are a boon for busy people. Many working couples can’t imagine a life without washing machines, refrigerators or dishwashers. Most of them have given up traditional ways of cooking and cleaning. It is a choice mandated by circumstances.
To conclude, I certainly don’t believe that technological advancements have caused traditional ways of life to die out. Technology has merely presented another option. It is up to us to decide whether we want to embrace modern ways or traditional ways. As for the question of whether traditions should be allowed to die because preserving them is pointless, well, I feel that societies all over the world have preserved customs and traditions that are important to them. Those that change are certainly those that weren’t good in the first place.",9,ielts-essay-has-technology-caused-traditional-ways-of-life-to-die
261,The quality of life in large cities is decreasing. What would be the reasons behind this? What measures can be taken to resolve this problem?,"Cities make huge contributions to the growth and development of a nation. They provide employment opportunities and because of this reason, they attract job seekers from all over the country. The influx of migrants makes cities crowded and affects the quality of living.
Take, for instance, the case of Mumbai and Delhi. These are the largest cities in India, but they are also the most polluted ones. Pollution causes many health problems and affects the overall quality of living.
Pollution isn’t the only problem that affects the inhabitants of our cities. Many of our cities don’t have adequate health facilities or infrastructure. Traffic jams are common and people often have to spend hours to commute to work. As a result, they get hardly any time for themselves or their family. This affects their work-life balance and overall sense of well-being.
Stress is another factor that plays havoc with the health of urban dwellers. It is true that cities provide well-paying jobs but many employees are under tremendous pressure to achieve targets and meet deadlines. They miss out on the little pleasures of life and often develop psychological problems like depression.
The government can improve the quality of life by building infrastructure and providing adequate transportation facilities. There should be places for recreation. For example, every city should have parks and playgrounds. What is even more important is to develop tier II and tier III cities. There is a limit to the number of people that a city can accommodate. If government provides job opportunities in small towns, people will not have to move to large cities.
To conclude, overpopulation is the main problem that affects our cities. To solve this problem and to improve the quality of living in cities, the government has to develop smaller towns surrounding big cities.",9,ielts-essay-about-quality-of-life-in-cities
262,"Today we can see excessive consumption of natural resources such as air, fresh water, oil and so on. The usage is increasing at a very dangerous pace and is already reaching critical levels. What are the reasons contributing to this? What should be done to minimise the effects?","The excessive consumption of natural resources has led to their depletion. This is creating a lot of problems for the environment as well as its inhabitants.
Natural resources such as coal and petrol are non-renewable sources of energy. Because of their excessive consumption, these resources are becoming exhausted. This will lead to an increase in energy costs. When oil prices increase, prices of other commodities will also increase because of the increase in the cost of transportation.
The growing population is the main factor that leads to the exploitation of natural resources. Over 7 billion people live on this planet. They all need food to eat and water to drink. In many parts of the world, people don’t even get potable water. Someone wisely said that the Third World War would be for water. The water scarcity in many countries is alarming. People often have to walk miles to fetch water. This problem is particularly worse in developing and undeveloped countries.
Industrialization is also increasing the demand for fuel. The world is hungry for resources. There are too many vehicles on the road. They all need oil. To power the factories and the vehicles, we are exploiting all available sources of energy.
Consumerism has also played an important role in the exhaustion of natural resources. People want to show off their wealth; so they build big homes and buy cars. They buy the latest gadgets as soon as they hit the market. They are not all worried about the environmental impact of their actions. This has to change. The government and other agencies have to spread awareness about the need to conserve our resources.
To conclude, consumerism and industrialization are the main factors leading to the depletion of natural resources. This is an alarming development with far-reaching consequences. The only way to mitigate the negative effects is to prevent the mindless consumption of natural resources at any cost. There should be legislations to protect the environment. Also, we should focus on renewable energy resources.",9,ielts-essay-about-the-depletion-of-natural-resources
263,"Newspapers affect people’s ideas and opinions. Do you agree or disagree? If you agree, is it a positive or a negative development?","There is no denying the fact that newspapers influence the way we think and act. They shape our perspectives. In my opinion, this influence has both positive and negative aspects.
Let’s start with the positives. Newspapers play a big role in keeping the world sane. They keep us informed of the happenings around us. They voice the concerns of the society and ensure that authorities listen to people and their needs.
In India, national newspapers played an important role during the freedom struggle. They made sure that the country stood united and fought for freedom. Newspapers make people aware of their rights and help them fight for them. They ensure that our society does not rot. They expose corruption and guide the nation in the right direction.
On the flip side, newspapers have their fair share of negatives. Journalism has changed over the years. Values have also changed. Many newspapers that championed the cause of the country and its people during the freedom struggle are now owned by corporate houses that are only interested in protecting their business interests. They have lost their social commitment. They are no longer the voice of the common man. In fact, some of our widely circulated newspapers don’t even feel the need to stand up for the less privileged sections of the society.
Many newspapers now glorify the luxurious lives of celebrities and often succeed in convincing common people that their lives aren’t worth living. They promote consumerism. They make people believe that life is all about shopping and partying. Also many newspapers have political affiliations. They often distort news and issues to serve the interests of the party they are affiliated to. This does not help the cause of the nation.
To conclude, it is true that newspapers influence public opinion. While this influence is largely positive, there are some negative sides too. In my opinion, everyone should read at least two newspapers to get a better understanding of the world.",9,ielts-essay-about-the-influence-of-newspapers
264,School children are becoming far too dependent on computers. This has a negative effect on their reading and writing skills. Teachers need to avoid using computers in the classroom at all costs and go back to old methods of teaching. Do you agree or disagree?,"Computers and the internet aid the process of learning. They may have their drawbacks, but these technologies make learning easier. For example, with the help of the internet, children can find information on any topic. Having an internet connection is a bit like having access to all the books in the world. Students can also interact with their classmates and teachers over the internet.
There are several drawbacks too. In the past, students had to read a lot of books to find the information they needed to complete their assignments. Reading enhanced their knowledge and improved their perspective. Now they only have to use a search engine and type in their queries to find the exact information they need. While this makes researching easier, it also limits the amount of knowledge that students can acquire.
In my opinion, writing skills are the worst hit by the excessive use of computers. Most word processors have spelling and grammar checkers. They eliminate the need to learn spelling. In fact, most of our students can’t write even a simple letter without the help of computers because they don’t know the spelling of words. Typing also affects handwriting skills. Most youngsters have poor handwriting skills because they almost never write.
While these are certainly the drawbacks of computers, I don’t believe that we can solve these problems by banning computers from the classroom. Instead, parents and teachers need to incorporate activities that require students to read and write. What’s more, computers make learning more fun and interactive. There are various educational activities that make learning more interesting and efficient. Computer usage also decreases paperwork in the classroom as students can submit their assignments online.
To conclude, I disagree with the view that teachers should stop using computers in the classroom. We cannot say no to emerging technologies if we want to equip our children with the skills they need to succeed in the workplace.",9,ielts-essay-should-computers-be-banned-from-the-classroom
265,Being a celebrity – such as a famous film star or a sports personality – brings problems as well as benefits. Do you think that being a celebrity brings more benefits than problems? Or is it the other way around?,"Celebrities have fans all over the world and they are always in the news. Sometimes they make news for right reasons, and sometimes for wrong reasons. In my opinion, celebrities face more problems than the benefits they enjoy.
Very few celebrities actually manage to avoid controversies and this often takes a toll on their emotional health. In fact it is not uncommon for celebrities to develop psychological problems because of the constant media scrutiny.
It is true that celebrities enjoy the respect and adulation of millions of fans. They get to make a lot of money by endorsing various products. They are recognized by people all over the world. They get invited to inaugurate various functions. While all of these are the advantages of being a celebrity, they also have to deal with encroachment into their personal space. Their privacy often gets violated. Celebrity gossips circulate like wildfire. Also there is a class of journalists called paparazzis who follow celebrities wherever they go. They circulate embarrassing celebrity photos and videos and make money. Worse still, celebrities cannot go out without security personnel. When they step out, their fans follow them and make it impossible for them to enjoy themselves.
Celebrities also get criticized even when they act with the best of inventions. People always try to interpret their actions and words in a negative way. For example, Amir Khan’s television program ‘Satyamev Jayate’ attracted a lot of criticism from various corners of the society although the actor did not have any wrong motives.
To conclude, it is true that celebrities benefit from the name and fame that stardom bring. However, they also have to deal with a lot of problems. There have been several cases of highly talented people who could not achieve their true potential because of their inability to cope with the demands of stardom. So, I believe that celebrities experience more problems than the benefits they hardly enjoy.",9,ielts-essay-do-celebrities-experience-more-problems-than-the-benefits-they-enjoy
266,"Modern technology, such as personal computers and the internet, has made it possible for many people to work from their home. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this situation?","Technology has changed the way we work. The advent of the internet and networking solutions has made it possible for people to work from their home instead of their offices. In my opinion, this development has more advantages than disadvantages.
Perhaps the biggest advantage is that people can work flexible hours. This arrangement is especially helpful for women who have young children. Many of them who quit their job after the birth of their children are now back in the job market. Obviously, they are looking for positions that allow them to work from their homes.
Male employees also benefit from working from home. In big cities like Mumbai or Bangalore, people spend hours commuting to work and home. If they get an opportunity to work from their home, they can save a lot of time. This will improve their work-life balance and overall sense of wellbeing. Employers also benefit from this arrangement. When employees work from their homes, the cost of running the business comes down. Working from home also saves valuable resources. Less commuting means less travel. This can result in significant fuel savings and cleaner air.
There are a few challenges as well. Employees working from home may have difficulty building a rapport with others in their team. In addition, they may find it difficult to get instant support when problems arise. However, an efficient management can easily take care of these problems.
To conclude, there are several benefits to working from home. Many employers have already realized this and started encouraging their workers to work from home. In the future, we will certainly have more organizations taking this route.",9,band-9-essay-sample-advantage-and-disadvantage-of-working-from-home
267,Topic,"Professional athletes enjoy great fan-following. Youngsters idolize them. Some people believe that their success and popularity make them great role models; however, not everybody agrees with this view.
Young people can learn a lot from successful sportsmen. On field, sportsmen are the epitome of positive qualities like strength, agility, speed, stamina, focus and determination.  Their hard work, perseverance and dedication to their game are commendable. Even youngsters who have no ambition to become athletes can learn a lot from the never-say-die spirit players exhibit on field. These qualities certainly make them great role models.
On the flip side, many sports personalities have a tainted personal life. In spite of their professional success, many of them get into crimes. They pick up fights with fans and journalists. They get into brawls. They flaunt multiple girlfriends. At least some of them have been convicted for abusing or even killing their girlfriends or wives.
Several sports personalities have also got themselves involved in match fixing scandals. They betrayed their country and their fans for monetary gains. There are also athletes who endorse products like cigarettes or alcohol. Considering the amount of influence they have on young people, they have a responsibility to stay away from such practices, but very few of them seem to care. Of course, there are a few exceptions to this. Sports personalities like Sachin Tendulkar, Roger Federer and Steffi Graph have maintained their clean image both on and off the field.
To conclude, sportsmen do have several qualities that make them role models for youngsters. They can teach youngsters qualities such as perseverance and dedication. However, many of them also possess a lot of negative traits. Young people need to understand that they are admiring the player on the field and not the person off it.",9,ielts-essay-do-sportsmen-make-great-role-models
268,"When the government punishes the murderer with death penalty, it also becomes guilty of committing murder. Therefore, life imprisonment is a better punishment for murderers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.","There has been a great deal of debate about whether the death penalty should be abolished. Capital punishment allows the government to legally execute a person who has committed a heinous crime. In my opinion, this cannot be justified because no one, not even the government, has the right to take a life.
Some people believe that the death penalty acts as a deterrent. In their opinion, the fear of the noose will prevent people from committing crimes. In reality, however, this is not the case. The crime rate in countries where the death penalty still exists is not lower than the crime rate in countries where it has been abolished. This is probably because people rarely think about the consequences before they commit a crime. Crimes are usually committed on the spur of the moment. The death penalty cannot act as a deterrent in this case. In the case of premeditated crimes, the criminal often takes all precautions to ensure that he does not get caught.
In many cases, the people who get the capital punishment are those from the lower strata of the society. They got convicted because they could not afford to get adequate legal representation in the court. By contrast, the rich and the influential most of the time manage to escape the noose even after committing deadly crimes.
In my opinion, instead of sending criminals to the gallows, the authorities should sentence them to life in prison. This gives them enough time to ponder over the trauma they have caused to the victims and the society. That introspection may even reform them.
To conclude, the death penalty has not been successful in reducing the crime rate in countries where it still exists. Killing is a crime. The government that is required to protect people cannot be allowed to take their lives.",9,ielts-essay-about-life-imprisonment-and-death-penalty
269,"Youngsters these days find hardly any time for leisure. Is this a positive development? What are the causes of this? If this is a problem, can you suggest solutions?","In this highly competitive world, finding time for leisure activities has become rather difficult. This is particularly true in the case of youngsters. They are overburdened with their studies and often get very little time for enjoying themselves. This is not a positive development. This essay will shed light on the causes of this problem and suggest solutions.
Nowadays cut-throat competition exists in the job market. Only the best candidates get the jobs. In such a scenario, youngsters are forced to study hard for ridiculously long hours. They don’t want to get low grades because they are worried that poor academic performance may affect their career prospects. In addition, there is tremendous pressure from the parents. In a country like India, where the grades of the children have always been a status symbol for the parents, children are under pressure to perform. As a result, many of them avoid leisure activities and concentrate on their studies.
Higher secondary students need good marks in their term examinations to secure admission to the course of their choice. Everybody wants to get into prestigious institutions because a degree from a good college almost always guarantees a high paying job with excellent career prospects.
Unfortunately, excessive focus on studies has several negative consequences. Parents and teachers who overburden students with high expectations need to realize that the human brain needs rest and relaxation to perform well. Excessive pressure will make children anxious and ill. Even a small amount of leisure will provide the brain the much needed relaxation. A well-rested brain will also help the child perform better in the classroom.
To conclude, youngsters need to maintain a balance between studies and leisure. They need both for optimal performance. Also parents and teachers need to realize that a child does not have to be academically brilliant to have a successful career. What they need to do is to find out the latent talents of a child and help them develop.",9,ielts-essay-about-studies-and-leisure
270,Children are becoming undisciplined. Discuss the causes of this problem and suggest solutions.,"Lack of discipline among youngsters is one of the biggest problems that we face today. Children don’t listen to their parents or teachers and often indulge in activities that are harmful to them as well as the society.
There are many causes of indiscipline among youngsters. The emergence of nuclear families is one of them. In nuclear families, children are the center of attraction. Parents cater to their whims and fancies. Pampered children are more likely to grow into undisciplined youngsters. They don’t take responsibility for their actions. They throw tantrums when they don’t get what they want. They don’t appreciate the hard work their parents put in to bring them up. They simply hate authority.
The situation is worse in families where both parents work. Children are often left under the supervision of a baby sitter who may or may not be competent enough to perform the job. When parents are busy and do not keep tab on their children, they are sowing the seeds of indiscipline.
Teachers have also lost the respect and authority they used to enjoy. Nowadays the relationship between the teacher and the student has become very shallow. Teachers are under tremendous pressure to complete the syllabus. As a result, they cannot impart value based education. This causes students to go astray. The media also glorify acts of violence and rebellion. Youngsters are highly impressionable. They get influenced by all that they see and hear.
There is no denying the fact that indiscipline among young people has become a social malady. This is a major cause for concern. Children are the future of a nation. They cannot be allowed to indulge in destructive activities. Parents and teachers need to monitor their activities and show them the right path whenever they go astray. The media can also play an important role in inculcating values in children.",9,ielts-essay-about-lack-of-discipline-among-youngsters
271,"Handwriting skills (using a pencil, a pen or a brush) are on decline. What can be the reasons for this? Is it a positive or a negative development?","Handwriting is a skill that we need to develop with practice. Before computers and printers became commonplace, there was a great deal of emphasis on good handwriting. Both parents and teachers encouraged children to write neatly and clearly. Good handwriting could even get one better grades. Handwriting is still important but very few people now use a pen or pencil in their everyday life. In my opinion, this is a negative development. It is okay to adopt technology but it must not be at the expense of the skills integral for our growth and success.
Computerization has affected the handwriting skills of both children and adults. Now nearly every office has computers. Schools and colleges are also computerizing their classrooms. As a result, typing has replaced writing. This explains why handwriting skills are deteriorating.
Handwriting is a reflection of character. By simply analysing your handwriting, experts can get clues about your personality traits. In fact, some businesses commission this analysis before hiring employees. Obviously, those who write legibly have improved chances of getting jobs. What’s more, many standardized tests are still paper-based. IELTS is a very good example of this. A candidate with poor handwriting skills will have a tough time achieving a good band score in this test. If handwriting is not legible, the examiner will not be able to find out what the student has written. This will lead to poor grades.
Handwriting helps the brain development in younger children. It activates the brain more than keyboarding. It is also known to improve reading fluency. For example, cursive writing is known to help both children and adults with dyslexia.
To conclude, over dependence on computers is the number one cause of declining handwriting skills. This is a negative development and can have an adverse impact on one’s career prospects.",9,ielts-essay-about-declining-handwriting-skills
272,Nowadays better communication technologies are available and hence people can communicate in numerous ways. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your opinion.,"Thanks to the advent of the internet and cellphones, we can now communicate in faster and better ways. In my opinion, this is largely a positive development. However, there are some negative aspects as well.
Modern communication technology has made our lives easier and faster. The inability to instantly communicate with our friends, relatives and business partners living in the same or different parts of the world has changed our lives for good. Cellphones allow parents to know the whereabouts of their children no matter where they are in the world. Online chats allow consumers to connect with businesses and get solutions to their problems. And with video chats businesses can communicate with their partners and clients in other countries without having to travel to those places. This arrangement saves money as well as time. Technologies like VoIP have made online communication cheaper. And if one mode of communication fails, we can always resort to the other. Better communication technology also helps people and governments to better prepare themselves for emergencies.
On the flip side, improved communication technologies have also made our lives more complicated. Worse, they have led to greater isolation. Nowadays technology allows people to access every service they need without having to step outside. As a result, in many countries, especially in the west a growing number of people show a tendency to avoid face to face interactions with others. Unfortunately, this leads to isolation and can even cause psychological problems like depression.
Man is a social being and finds pleasure in the company of fellow social beings. Interestingly, many people now only connect with their online friends. They don’t even know who lives next doors. It is surprising that modern technology that allows us to communicate with others has also made face to face interactions a thing of past.
To conclude, better communication technology has definitely enriched our lives in many ways. There are some negative aspects to this, but in my opinion, the advantages outweigh disadvantages.",9,ielts-essay-about-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-modern-communication-technologies
273,"Some people think that computer games are bad for children, while others believe that they are useful. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of computer games and give your own opinion.","Computer games are addictive. That is the main reason children play them for hours on end. There are several disadvantages to spending a lot of time in front of the computer.
Computer games merely provide entertainment. Children who are addicted to computer games tend to have poor grades because they do not get enough time to focus on their studies. Also, they have reduced social skills. They are constantly glued to their screens and show hardly any interest in interacting with their family members or peers. This can lead to social isolation and serious behavioural problems.
Some popular computer games glorify violence and crime. Children who grow up playing these games may get into anti-social activities. Even if they don’t become criminals in the future, they may still exhibit a disregard for values.
Computer games also cause vision problems in children. Children are not supposed to stare at the computer screen for hours on end. If they do, they will develop serious eye strain which may also affect their studies.
On the bright side, computer games make children competitive. Games that require them to play against virtual or real opponents living in another part of the world improve their concentration and ability to take decisions quickly. These are definitely positive aspects but a child does not have to play computer games to develop these skills.
To conclude, after analysing the advantages and disadvantages of playing computer games it is not hard to see that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. In my opinion, parents should restrict the amount of time their children spend in front of the computers. That said, there is no harm in playing a game or two every now and then, but addiction is definitely a problem.",9,ielts-essay-about-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-computer-games
274,Airlines are dropping their prices. Is it a positive or a negative development? Support your stand with examples.,"Airfares are falling. In my opinion, this is a positive development because it allows more people to travel overseas, do business, learn new languages and discover interesting places.
Low airfares will definitely encourage more and more people to travel to exotic locations abroad. They get to discover new places and culture. The influx of travelers also benefits the local economy. I feel that travel has the potential to make the world a better place. When people travel to other places, they learn to respect various cultures, lifestyles and beliefs. This helps them develop a better perspective on life and makes them more tolerant of differences.
Falling airfares have a very positive impact on the economy as well. It benefits exporters because they can take their products to foreign markets without having to spend a lot of money on transportation. It helps consumers as well. Indian textiles are more expensive in America than in India because the cost of transportation is also added to the price. Cheaper air travel will make imported goods more affordable. Cheap air travel also benefits international students and business people who regularly travel abroad.
Perhaps the only downside is the impact on the environment. There are toxic pollutants in the plane exhaust and they can cause health problems and global warming. While these are definitely causes for concern, better technology may prevent these problems in the future.
To conclude, falling airfares benefit everyone who has to travel long distances for business or recreational purposes. Increase in air travel also boosts the economy and creates jobs. I definitely feel that this is a positive development.",9,ielts-essay-about-falling-air-fares
275,"Many developed countries are giving financial aid to poor countries. However, this hasn’t solved the problem of poverty in these nations and so other types of help are needed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Developed nations have more money than they need, so they give financial assistance to undeveloped and developing nations. I certainly agree with the view that this financial aid hasn’t solved all the problems plaguing poor countries. However, it has definitely improved the situation in those countries to a certain extent.
Corruption is one of the biggest problems that poor nations face. Even if rich nations give financial aid, the money does not reach the people who need it. Millions of people living in poor countries lack education. They are not even aware of their rights and accept poverty as if it was their birthright. If a nation is to progress, it needs empowered people who are aware of their rights and who have the capability to fight for it.
An honest and efficient administrative system is required for the development of any nation. Corrupt officials and ignorant people who are not aware of their rights have never helped any nation. Unfortunately, developed nations that give the financial assistance cannot do much to improve the government or administrative system present in poor nations. No nation can interfere in another nation’s internal affairs beyond a certain level. So, other than giving financial assistance there is not much that rich nations can do to help poor nations.
To conclude, I certainly agree with the view that foreign aid hasn’t solved the problems of poor countries. However, this does not mean that developed nations should stop giving financial assistance. They should continue to give money but the purpose of giving financial assistance should be the empowerment of people. Eradication of poverty is equally important but as they say teaching a man how to fish is much better than giving him a fish.",9,ielts-essay-about-financial-assistance-to-poor-nations
276,Some people think that man-made Zoos should not exist in the 21st century. Do you agree or disagree?,"There are several arguments against confining animals to cages and other small enclosures just for the sake of keeping human visitors entertained. Animal rights activists have always insisted that zoos should be banned. I certainly agree with this view.
It is true that zoos provide education and entertainment. Both children and adults enjoy visiting zoos because they provide an opportunity to see wild animals without having to go the jungle. After all, not everybody can go on an African safari to see lions, rhinoceros or hippopotamuses. But this is hardly a justification for keeping animals in zoos. Man has no right to capture them and imprison them in small enclosures.
Wild animals thrive in the wilderness. Any attempt to remove them from their natural habitat for keeping people entertained is unethical. Instead of building zoos, the government should develop wild life sanctuaries and national parks. The general public interested in seeing animals can go on guided jungle safaris. The thrill that one experiences when one sees a lion or tiger in the jungle cannot be explained in words. Zoos do not provide that kind of excitement or adrenaline rush.
Zoos do not help animals in any way. Yes, there are people who believe that zoos are required to protect endangered animals and birds; however, I don’t think that this argument holds water. When African wild animals are brought to zoos in India or Europe, they have to struggle hard to adapt to the different climate and ecosystem.
To conclude, I certainly agree with the view that zoos should not exist in this century. It is true that they provide some entertainment, but we have absolutely no right to confine animals to small enclosures for our amusement.",9,ielts-essay-should-zoos-be-banned
277,"Some celebrities say that their private lives shouldn’t come under media scrutiny. Other people, however, believe that they should accept it as part of their fame. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Celebrities live under constant media surveillance. Every aspect of their life makes headlines. Some of them certainly enjoy the attention they get; others have problems with it.
Celebrities thrive on the media attention they get. That is exactly what makes them celebrities. No one complains when they are making news for all the right reasons. Even celebrities who guard their personal lives have no problems when the media praises them for their immaculate sense of dressing or their flamboyant lifestyle. They themselves post personal photos on their social profiles. But when the same media lambast them for wearing the wrong outfit or dating the wrong person, they get upset. They get upset when the media publishes their unflattering images.
Just like any other person, celebrities also have a right to privacy. But when you decide to be a celebrity, you are actually agreeing to live under constant media scrutiny and public attention.
There are several benefits to being a celebrity. Celebrities enjoy good popularity. This popularity helps them endorse products and make truckloads of money. They are icons to millions of people. Naturally people want to know about their personal lives and the media satisfy that hunger. This often results in the intrusion of privacy.
To conclude, constant media scrutiny is a byproduct of stardom. A person who enjoys the benefits of being a celebrity must be willing to take the negative aspects as well. In my opinion, celebrities should take this sportingly. By choosing to become a celebrity they themselves have agreed to be in the limelight. So, they should take any intrusion into their personal life as part of their fame.",9,ielts-essay-about-celebrities-and-their-personal-lives
278,In some countries old people are highly valued and in other countries the young are considered to be more valuable. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Age brings wisdom. That probably explains why old people are revered in many countries especially those in the east. In the west, on the other hand, the youth get more importance and attention.
Youth is the time when you can accomplish many things. The young are full of energy. They are independent. Their energy and zest for life allow them to accomplish many things. In the west, there is too much emphasis on individual growth and material gains. That probably explains why youngsters get more opportunities and respect there.
By contrast, eastern countries put a great deal of emphasis on spiritual growth. Old people have seen more life and hence they know better. They are much less impulsive than their younger counterparts. This enables them to make better judgements. In eastern countries, children and youngsters look up to their parents and grandparents for advice and guidance in important matters. For example, in Indian families important decisions are always taken by parents or grandparents. Children listen to them. It is not considered appropriate to defy one’s parents and few youngsters do it.
In western countries senior parents have no real say in their grown-up children’s lives. There senior adults often spend their twilight years in care homes away from their children and grandchildren. I am certainly against that arrangement. Many old people can’t work or run a household in the strict sense of the term. However, they can still offer guidance. They can act as the voice of reason when problems arise in the family. The youth should be given the importance they deserve but this does not mean that seniors should be neglected.
To conclude, both the young and the old are valuable members of the society. It is true that old people are less productive than young people but it does not mean that they are useless. They are wiser and their sane voice can solve many conflicts in the family and the society.",9,band-9-essay-sample-in-some-countries-old-people-are-more-valued
279,"Most employers interview candidates before hiring them. Do you think this is the best way to do it, or are there better alternatives? In your opinion, what is the best method for choosing employees?","In most cases the interview is the last hurdle that an applicant has to clear before landing a job. Interviews probably aren’t a foolproof method of selecting candidates; however, I can’t suggest any better alternatives.
An employer can’t fully assess a candidate’s capabilities, personality or character during an interview. Several personality development centers now prepare candidates for interviews. They are taught how to answer questions that are frequently asked during interviews. Sometimes a candidate who possesses better qualifications may fail to get the job because of his poor performance in the interview.
However, I don’t think that interviews should be done away with. Employers all over the world use this selection process to find the best candidates. This is a clear indication that interviews are an efficient method of selecting good candidates.
In my opinion, interviews should not be the only criterion for selecting candidates. They should be used in conjunction with written examinations during which a candidate’s proficiency in various subjects can be assessed. In addition, candidates should be asked to participate in debates or group discussions. Their real personality and leadership skills will come to the fore during these events.
To conclude, the interview is not a flawed recruitment process. It isn’t perfect but it certainly has more merits than demerits. In fact, when interviews are used in conjunction with other personality tests, they will definitely help businesses find the best candidates. Organisations should also consider hiring fresh graduates on a probationary basis. Those who deliver excellent performance during the probationary period should be hired to fill permanent positions.",9,band-9-essay-sample-do-you-think-interviews-are-the-best-method-for-selecting-candidates
280,Many students find it difficult to learn subjects like mathematics and philosophy and hence they should be optional in schools. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"There is no denying the fact that subjects like mathematics and philosophy are difficult for many students. This, however, does not mean that they should be made optional. Children need to master at least the basic concepts of these subjects to be able to get on with their lives.
Not all students want to be engineers or bank managers. They don’t have to be either but they should still be able to do addition and subtraction. They should understand the concepts of multiplication and division. If they lack these skills, they will find it difficult to manage their everyday life.
Mathematics plays a very important role in our life. Children will not remain children for life. The will become adults a few years down the lane and then they have to manage their finances. Students who didn’t study mathematics at school will not be able to take care of their finances. The fact that they don’t have even basic math skills will also affect their employability. No employer will hire someone who can’t even solve simple sums.
The same is true in the case of philosophy as well. It is not a subject that many students can digest. However, it offers a better perspective on life and helps us to cope with the ups and downs of life.
The existing education system allows students to choose subjects of their preference when they start university education. In my opinion, children should be taught all subjects at the school level. They can choose subjects of their preference when they go for higher education.
To conclude, I strongly disagree with the view that subjects like mathematics and philosophy should be made optional because such a decision will do students more harm than good.",9,band-9-essay-sample-should-subjects-like-mathematics-and-philosophy-be-optional-at-school
281,It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules.,"Smoking is injurious to health. It can even cause deadly diseases like cancer. Many countries have already banned smoking in public places. In my opinion, others too should follow suit and ban it.
There are several benefits to banning smoking in public places. Smoking ban will definitely improve the quality of air we breathe. Cigarette contains nicotine which is a cancerous substance. In addition to cancer, smoking causes several other health problems. In fact, statistics have shown tremendous rise in the occurrence of mouth cancer among people who smoke regularly. Some studies have also shown that people who smoke more than 3 cigarettes a day have increased chances of developing cancer. Smoking may also cause other problems like heart attack and respiratory illnesses.
The biggest problem with smoking is that in order to suffer from its ill effects, you don’t necessarily have to be a smoker. Passive smoking also kills. It is particularly harmful for young children and pregnant women. If people are allowed to smoke in crowded public places like railway stations or bus stands, its harmful effects will have to be borne by all people standing next to the smoker. Banning smoking in public places is the only way to solve this problem.
Pollution is one of the biggest problems that we face today. Smoking not only aggravates this problem but it also causes the depletion of the ozone layer which protects us from sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. It is evident that smoking plays a significant role in damaging our health and our environment.
In conclusion, I personally believe that all governments should ban smoking in public places. This might cause some inconvenience to chain smokers, but ultimately this ban will benefit them as well.",9,band-9-essay-sample-all-governments-should-ban-smoking-in-public-places
282,Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students. Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?,"Students who participate in international student exchange programs gain rich benefits. They return as more confident individuals with a wider perspective on life and international affairs. Needless to say many parents and teachers support these programs. In my opinion, international student exchange programs have more advantages than disadvantages.
Student exchange programs force students to leave their comfort zone and explore a foreign territory totally unknown to them. This helps them discover their hidden talents and leadership qualities. They also learn to adapt to unfamiliar surroundings and living conditions. As a result, they become bolder and more confident.
In countries like India, children are overly dependent on their parents. In fact, it is not uncommon for Indian parents to take decisions on their children’s behalf even after they turn adults. When these teens participate in exchange programs they learn to live on their own.
Also, when students get to study in another country and mingle with students of another culture, their perspective on life broadens. They learn to tolerate differences. They also understand that the world is big enough to accommodate people of all faiths, customs and religions. This makes them better individuals.
Cultural exchange is another benefit. When students live abroad as part of an exchange program, they learn to appreciate another culture. They also bring their culture with them. This allows their hosts to become familiar with their culture.
Student exchange programs also improve the career prospects of the participants. Because of their broader perspective and their exposure to international communities, they are sought after by companies that operate in different parts of the world.
To conclude, there are several benefits to participating in international student exchange programs. These programs boost the confidence levels of the participants and make them more tolerant.",9,band-9-essay-sample-should-students-participate-in-international-student-exchange-programs
283,Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.,"Language is the means of communication. There is no denying the fact the life would be a whole lot easier if we all spoke the same language. However, this does not mean that we should let languages die.
In the past, language barriers used to prevent people living in one part of the world from communicating with people living in another part. Now thanks to the availability of better modes of transport people are traveling to other countries and continents. This has also led to the massive adoption of languages spoken in the developed world. English is a good example. People coming from developing countries are trying hard to learn English because it opens many doors. This is definitely a positive development.
On the flip side, the world wide adoption of a couple of languages that have a large number of speakers has led to the death of several less popular languages. These are mainly the languages spoken in the developing world. Some of them don’t have a large number of speakers. Others do have enough speakers, but learning or speaking them do not improve a person’s career prospects and hence they do not enjoy acceptance even in their countries.
For example, most parents in India now send their children to English medium schools because English enhances their employability. Unfortunately, this is leading to the death of several local languages. When a language dies, the culture associated with it is also dying. This may have far reaching consequences. When communities adopt foreign languages and allow their mother tongues to die, they are actually allowing their culture and legacy to die. In the process, they will also lose their identity.
To conclude, the death of local languages is an alarming development. There is no harm in adopting a popular language like English. It will make communication easier and improve our lives. However, we should still keep our mother tongues alive by using them within our country and community.",9,band-9-essay-sample-can-we-allow-languages-to-die
284,"Health experts say that walking is the best form of exercise; however, people now walk less. What could be the reason for this? What might encourage people to walk longer distance?","A daily walk of 30 minutes is said to be the best exercise. Our grandparents used to walk for miles on end to reach their destination. Today, people walk much less. Many factors are responsible for this.
In the developed world most families have cars. They don’t walk even to the nearest grocery store. In the developing world, too, people are giving up the habit of walking because they have easy access to public transport systems.
We all seek comfort. Walking on foot can be tiring. Needless to say, people prefer to travel by buses or cars whenever they have access to them. Motor vehicles are fast and thus they also help save time. Unfortunately, this habit of using the car or bus has several negative consequences. Most of us now spend hours in the office sitting in front of a computer. Because of this sedentary lifestyle, we have developed many health problems like obesity, diabetes and heart trouble. We can avoid most of these lifestyle diseases by simply walking for 30 minutes a day.
Many people who have given up the habit of walking are unaware of the health problems they face. The government and health workers need to create awareness among the general public about the benefits of walking. People who use a car should park their vehicle farther from their office and take steps instead of the elevator. Children too should be encouraged to walk to school. Once they get used to this habit, they are more likely to stick to it in the future too.
To conclude, lack of time and the need for comfort are the reasons that prevent people from walking. However, most of us will start walking again if we are aware of its health benefits. So, creating awareness is the key. The government and the media can play an important role in this.",9,band-9-essay-sample-why-do-people-walk-less-now
285,"Some people say that mobile phones should be banned in public places such as libraries, shops and public transport. Do you agree or disagree?","Mobiles have made communication easier and more convenient. However, sometimes people talking on their mobile phone disturb the surrounding environment and the general public. Because of this reason, several people have opined that the use of mobile phones should be banned in public places like libraries, shops and on buses and trains. I agree with this view.
When people traveling on a bus or train make or receive calls on their mobile phone, they are causing a great deal of disturbance to other passengers. In order to ensure that the listener can hear properly, the caller often talks too loudly. This can disturb fellow passengers who may be reading or sleeping. And when people driving a vehicle talk on their mobiles, it can result in fatal accidents. This cannot be allowed at all.
Libraries are another place where the use of mobile phones should be banned or discouraged. Library is meant for reading and thinking. If people use mobile phones when they are inside the library, they will unnecessarily disturb other people reading or studying there.
By simply banning mobiles in public places, we cannot perhaps solve this problem. We also need to create awareness about the proper and polite way to use mobiles in public places.
Mobile phones have become an integral part of our lives. In fact, most of us can’t even imagine a life without our mobiles. They are also a blessing in emergencies. In such situations, their use must be permitted.
To conclude, there is a real need to ban the use of mobile phones in public places. It is true that they are a necessity and have enriched our lives in many ways, but their excessive use in public places must be discouraged at any cost.",9,band-9-essay-sample-should-mobiles-be-banned-in-public-places
286,Nowadays more people prefer to socialize online rather than face to face. Is this a positive or negative development?,"People are glued to their cellphones and tablets. They are constantly updating their status on social networks and checking out the photos and videos uploaded by their virtual friends. In fact, most of us now have more friends online than in the real world. In my opinion, this is a negative development that can have far reaching consequences.
Excessive online socialization can lead to depression, isolation and behavioural problems. The internet is a great platform to share views and opinions, but it also fuels unhealthy competition among people. Studies have shown that people develop an inferiority complex when their friends get more comments or likes than them.
Social media has many negative sides. There is no guarantee that the people we meet online are actually real. Many of them create fake profiles with the objective of cheating naïve users. There have been several instances of teenagers committing suicide after they got cheated by their online friends. Most people who are addicted to online socialisation have hardly any time for talking to their family members or neighbours. This affects family relationships. Also, it can cause the individual to become isolated from his community.
Face to face communications, on the other hand, lead to the development of trustworthy relationships that last long. Meeting a friend or a dear one over a coffee or in a park is always a memorable experience. Social media friendships lack that warmth. Also, we cannot expect our online friends living in another part of the globe to help us when we are in trouble.
To conclude, it is not hard to see that excessive online socialization is bad. It affects our relationships. It is true that the internet has enriched our lives in many ways, but if we are addicted to it, we will develop many problems. After all, the virtual world cannot replace the real world; neither can virtual friends the real ones.",9,band-9-essay-sample-social-media-addiction
287,"With pressure on today’s young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects.","There is no denying the fact that school children are under tremendous pressure to perform well in academics. It is not surprising, though. Students who score high grades in academics are more likely to have a successful career in the future. Most schools these days have a curriculum that includes both academic and non-academic subjects. However, many parents and teachers believe that non-academic subjects should be removed from the curriculum so that children can focus on academics. This might sound logical but I do not believe that removing non-academic subjects is the solution.
To start with, non-academic activities like dance, drama, singing, cookery or physical education cause hardly any stress. In fact, they provide relaxation and help students concentrate better on academic subjects. Also, learning these subjects is essential for the overall development of children.
There are many more reasons to include non-academic subjects in the curriculum. Not all students are academically brilliant. However, this will not be an issue if the student has skills in other areas. For example, a student does not need an A grade in physics or mathematics to be a successful singer, writer or painter.
By encouraging students to engage in extra-curricular activities, schools can bring out their hidden talents. This will help not only the students but also the society. After all, not everybody is required to be a doctor or an engineer. The world needs athletes, writers, chefs and actors as well.
To conclude, there is no point is eliminating non-academic subjects from the syllabus. In my opinion, schools should encourage students to pursue a career in a field of their choice. This would not be possible without including a variety of topics in the curriculum.",9,band-9-essay-sample-should-schools-remove-non-academic-subjects-from-the-syllabus
288,"It is very clear now that English should be the primary foreign language taught in all schools around the world. Learning a different foreign language before English, in today’s world, is a waste of time.","English is the most widely spoken language in the world. In fact, the number of people who learn and speak English as a second language is greater than the number of people whose first language is English. Other international languages like Spanish, French, Mandarin and Hindi are also taught in many parts of the world. However, in my opinion, learning another foreign language before English is not worth our time or effort.
There are several benefits to learning English. People all over the world understand English. If you know English, you can travel to any country in the world. The huge popularity of the internet has also made learning English a necessity. Most information available on the internet is in English. A person who understands English can access the whole of this information.
Over the years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people who travel or study abroad. English is the language they use to communicate with others. Students who can speak and write English have better job opportunities than those who do not understand English. All of these make learning English imperative.
A language is the reflection of a culture. When we learn a foreign language, we get to know that culture. That probably explains why other international languages are also taught in schools and colleges. However, I see absolutely no justification for learning Spanish or German instead of English. Although these are all well-developed languages spoken by millions of people, they are much less influential than English.
In conclusion, it is evident that learning English is more beneficial than learning another foreign language. In my opinion, if a student plans to learn only one foreign language, then it has to be English.",9,band-9-essay-sample-is-learning-another-foreign-language-before-english-a-waste-of-time
289,Children today are too dependent on computers and electronic entertainment. It would be better for them to be outside playing sports and taking part in more traditional pastimes than spending all day indoors.,"Sample response
Most children are glued to their computer or cellphone these days. This is not a positive development because when children spend the whole day playing games on their computer or gaming console, they will develop many health problems. They may even develop behavioural problems. In my opinion, it is more beneficial for children to spend time outdoors playing sports or engaging in other activities.
Outdoor games are good for children. They make them fitter and stronger as individuals. Children who play games are healthier. They are also less likely to engage in antisocial activities. Better still, outdoor games require the participation of more than one individual. When children play games like football or cricket, they are also learning several social and management skills. They learn to share and work as part of a team.
On the other hand, children who spend the whole time indoors will most probably spend several hours in front of the TV or computer. This may lead to several health problems like obesity and diabetes. These children may also find it difficult to interact with others. Also, when they spend a lot of time on their computer, they are more likely to be exposed to inappropriate materials on the internet. All of these factors can have an adverse impact on their physical and psychological well-being.
To conclude, it is not hard to see that there are several benefits to engaging in outdoor activities. Parents should not allow children to waste their whole time in front of the TV or computer. Even in those families where both parents are away at work, parents can use software programs to limit their children’s exposure to television and the internet.",9,band-9-essay-sample-children-should-spend-more-time-outdoor-playing-games
290,In most developed countries the average life expectancy is constantly increasing. Discuss the positive and negative aspects of this trend.,"Thanks to advancements in medical research and improved quality of living people are living longer. This is definitely a positive trend, but it has some negative aspects too.
Everyone wants to live longer. We are constantly searching for new ways to add a few more years to our life. Longer life expectancy is considered as a symbol of better life and prosperity. Generally speaking, people in the developed world have greater life expectancy than those in poor countries. This is not surprising, though. Rich people have access to better life care and hence they live longer.
When people live longer they get an opportunity to fulfill their wishes and obligations. They will be able to serve the society with their experience and wisdom. They will also be able to spend more years with their family. Cultures all over the world regard longevity as a blessing. After all, longevity is the pursuit of most people. When they people live longer they will be able to contribute to the society in many ways. They can guide the youth with their wisdom.
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to living longer. Aged people may require care. If they have none to take care of them at home, they will have to go to an old age home. Families and governments have to spend a lot of money on providing healthcare and insurance to aged people. When people live longer, there will be an increase in the population of seniors. Since most of them are not capable of working or earning money, they can have an adverse impact on the economy. Also an increase in the population will result in the faster depletion of natural resources.
After analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that longevity is a fortune. It has some negative impacts on the economy and the environment. However, governments and communities can do many things to deal with this situation.",9,band-9-essay-sample-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-longevity
291,In some countries people prefer to live alone more often than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development? Why?,"Over the years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people who live alone. Globalisation has made it possible for people to find jobs in nearly all parts of the world. In a bid to build their career, they leave their home and country and live alone in another part of the world.
There has also been an increase in the number of people who prefer to live alone. I think this trend is more popular in western countries. There are at least a few benefits to living alone. When you live alone, you have absolute freedom. You also learn to do things on your own. This makes you stronger as a person.
On the other hand, living alone has several disadvantages too. Psychologists believe that being disconnected from one’s family can make one emotionally weak. As human beings, we need people to share our joys and sorrows with. We need people to take care of us when we are ill. Perhaps this is the biggest disadvantage of living alone. When you need help, you have none to offer it. In addition, people who are used to living alone may have difficulty adjusting when they have to share space with others. They might even come across as unfriendly.
After analysing this development it is not hard to see that living alone has its fair share of advantages and disadvantages. However, in my opinion, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Human beings are gregarious by nature. We seek company and feel happy when we have our friends and family around. It is true that the traditional family setup curtails the amount of freedom an individual can enjoy. However, there are very many ways to improve the situation. In my opinion, there is absolutely no need to live alone just to enjoy freedom.",9,band-9-essay-sample-is-living-alone-a-positive-development
292,"Some people believe that countries should invite foreign companies to open their branches, offices and factories in order to develop their economies. Others think countries should invest in their own companies instead. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many countries have been battling slow economic growth since year 2008. Some countries are on the verge of a financial breakdown. Financial problems and negative growth have encouraged many governments to solicit foreign investment in their countries. There are several advantages to attracting foreign investment. There are some disadvantages too.
On the bright side, foreign investment helps the local economy in many ways. When foreign companies open their branches and offices in a country, they help generate several jobs. This gives a boost to the local economy. The arrival of new companies also increases the competition in the market. This will encourage companies to price their products competitively. Tough competition will also improve the quality of products and services. It is evident that foreign investment benefits not only the country but also the consumer.
On the flip side, foreign investment has its fair share of disadvantages too. One should not forget that companies that set up their establishments on the foreign soil are driven by their desire to make more money. They aren’t looking to engage in charity work. They are financially stronger than local companies and hence they can easily stifle competition. Also in the past many multinational companies have been accused of engaging in unethical practices to kill local competition. Because of these reasons many economists feel that governments should help local companies instead of inviting foreign companies.
Considering the arguments in favor of and against inviting foreign companies, it is not hard to see that there are several benefits to attracting foreign companies. There are a few disadvantages too. However, governments can solve these problems by enacting proper laws to ensure healthy competition. By doing this governments can also protect small businesses and enable economic growth.

293,"Some people think that it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools. Others, however, believe that boys and girls benefit more from attending mixed schools. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The advantages and disadvantages of sending children to mixed schools have always been a subject of debate. Some parents and teachers feel that mixed schools are better; others are more in favour of separating boys and girls. In my opinion, both types of schooling have their merits and demerits.
There are at least a few benefits to separating boys and girls. It is quite normal to feel attracted to members of the opposite sex. This attraction often results in distractions. By separating boys and girls distractions can be reduced to a great extent. This will make the atmosphere in the classrooms more conducive to learning. If boys and girls are taught in the same schools, the chances of boys getting hyperactive are pretty high. It is a general fact that boys commit more mischiefs when girls are around. They want to impress girls and often fail to focus on their studies. If boys are taught in boys’ schools, this situation can be avoided.
On the flip side, single sex schools do not facilitate interaction between boys and girls. As a result children taught in single sex schools often find it difficult to interact with members of the opposite sex. This can lead to awkward moments at social gatherings where they have to deal with such encounters.
I think this is the biggest disadvantage of single-sex education. Mixed schools, on the other hand, allow boys and girls to interact freely and help in the overall development of their personality. When boys and girls study together, they get to understand the skills and limitations of each other.
After analysing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that mixed schools and single sex schools have their merits and demerits. However, in my opinion the advantages of teaching children in mixed schools outweigh the disadvantages. I hope that mixed school education will be promoted by parents and teachers.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-should-children-go-to-mixed-schools
294,Being a celebrity – such as a famous film star or sports personality – brings problems as well as benefits. Do you think that being a celebrity brings more benefits or more problems?,"Being a well-known personality has both positive and negative aspects. However, in my opinion, the benefits of being a celebrity outweigh the negatives. In this essay, I will support my stand by showing how fame elevates a person’s social standing and helps them feel good about themselves and the work they do.
One of the advantages of being a celebrity is that fame almost always brings riches. Celebrities are popular. This popularity makes them great brand ambassadors. Companies hire them to endorse their products because products promoted by celebrities tend to sell well. Since celebrities are rich they can buy just about anything they want without having to worry about the cost. Their popularity and their purchasing power make them feel satisfied with the work they do and help boost their morale.
Celebrities enjoy huge fan-following. Their fans regard them as role models and look up to them and follow their actions religiously. They do this with the hope of reaching the same level as their role models. Sports personalities like Roger Federer and Lionel Messi have numerous fans all over the world. Millions of children aspire to become champions like them. Thus it is evident how fame elevates a person’s social standing.
On the flip side, at times famous people can become victims of privacy invasion by their fans; such incidents, however, do not affect all of them. Some celebrities guard their privacy. Others don’t mind living in the limelight all the time. They enjoy the adulation they get.
To conclude, there are several benefits to being a celebrity. After analysing how fame makes a person rich and a role model for many, it is not hard to see that being a celebrity is an advantage, not a disadvantage.",9,band-9-ielts-essay-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-being-a-celebrity
295,Some people think that it is better to choose friends who always have the same opinion as them. Others believe it is good to have friends who sometimes disagree with you. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Choosing a friend and maintaining that friendship is crucial for staying mentally healthy. Some believe that friends should accord with them on every single topic while others view disagreement as beneficial and even constructive in certain situations. In this essay, I will discuss both opinions and give my own opinion.
To start with, opinions form characters and similar beliefs signify same characters. One of the advantages of having a friend with similar / same beliefs is that you can share hobbies and maintain your amity without fretting over quarrels and their grave repercussions. For instance, friends who agree that gambling in a poker game is ethically unproblematic can spend long hours together getting pleasure from the game without having to worry about the pangs of conscience. If these two friends had different stances towards poker, they would not be able to enjoy the game together.
However, discord in friendship is essential for vital decisions in your life. Disagreement can shed light on those aspects of life you are unaware of and this can lead to success. For instance, while pondering over immigrating to Canada a couple of years ago, I sought consultation from friends who disagreed with me on dozens of issues. Despite this, I found their suggestions about employment opportunities practical as they enlightened me about the issues I had neither foreseen on my own nor received from friends similar to me in character. Had I not listened to their differing opinions, I would not have been able to find a proper job in such a short time after landing in Canada.
In conclusion, there are certainly benefits to having friends who share the same values and opinions as us; it is equally important to have friends who can offer a different perspective on things.",8,some-people-think-that-it-is-better-to-choose-friends-who-always-have-the-same-opinion-as-them-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
296,Success is often measured by wealth and material belongings. Do you think wealth is the best measure of success? What makes a successful person?,"It is often thought by some people that wealth and material belongings are the measurement criteria of success. In my opinion, wealth is not the effective way to measure success as there are many other factors like good family relationship, health and dream career that make a person successful.
It is undeniable that everyone in the world strives for happiness and hence, it should be the best way to measure success. Although some people have wealth which is enough to buy all material belongings they want they attempt self-murder. For instance, life is quite stressful in some developed countries compared to developing or even underdeveloped countries. Therefore, wealth cannot be regarded as the criteria of measuring success.
There are several factors that contribute to making a person successful. Firstly, it is irrefutable that family support is of paramount importance throughout the journey of life. Good family not only brings happiness to our life but also helps us to share worries and thereby reduces stress. Secondly, getting a suitable career that matches a person’s area of interest is inevitable for leading a happy and consequently, a successful life. Career brightens a person’s self-esteem. If a person gets a dream job, it helps their career progression as well as job prospects. Finally, health is another obvious factor that is unavoidable for a successful life. Only if a person is healthy, he can work hard to gain success.
To conclude, money is not the basics of success because a person is successful only if he leads a happy and contended life. For this, he should have a good family, health and a satisfying career.",8,success-is-often-measured-by-wealth-and-material-belongings-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
297,"In many countries, the government prioritises economic growth above all other concerns. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages and give your own opinion.","It is argued that in some nations, the governing bodies / authorities give priority to economic growth as compared to the other concerns. While the main advantage of this approach is better living standards, I believe that it can affect health and education of the general public.
The primary advantage of prioritizing economic growth is that it can improve living standards and reduce the poverty rate. In other words, high average incomes enable consumers to enjoy more goods and services and a better lifestyle. This means that people will have more income that will eventually reduce the poverty rate. For example, a recent report published by BBC suggested that economic growth in the twentieth century was a major factor in reducing absolute levels of poverty and enabling a rise in life expectancy.
However, economic growth alone will not suffice. Health and education are equally important. The major drawback of prioritizing economic growth is that it can have a negative impact on the environment. China, for example, is growing rapidly. Unfortunately, this is at the expense of the environment. The air quality is China is perhaps the lowest in the world. Fast growing Indian cities are no different. While economic growth is good, the resultant pollution can affect the health of the people. It can also destroy wildlife. Another issue is that when nations try too hard to grow financially, culture and morality may take a hit.
In conclusion, although prioritizing economic growth is beneficial because it increases the living standards and reduces the poverty rate, I believe that it has a negative impact on the environment and health of people.",8,in-some-countries-the-government-prioritises-economic-growth-above-all-other-concerns-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
298,Some parents send their children to pre-school when they are three to four years old. Other parents wait until their children are old enough for primary school before they send them to school. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of sending children to pre-school at a young age.,"The modern education system has become very competitive. Some parents send their children to pre-school at a very young age while others wait for their children to reach the age they think is right to get admission in primary school. This approach has beneficial and adverse impacts on / outcomes for children. The essay will analyze both sides of the argument.
Elementary education has always proved to be beneficial for children. It provides the foundation on which the middle and high school curriculum expands. Thus, it helps the children shape their mind and gives them apparent concept of the basics of education. Firstly, it helps the children to learn skills at an early age. For instance, they start learning addition and subtraction early which help them in later age. Secondly, being around with kids from an early age motivates the children to socially interact with the community. Sending them to schools at an early age helps the children acquire wider general knowledge. As a result, children can form attitudes and opinions about things.
On the other hand, there are some downsides to sending kids to pre-school. It can affect the bonding between parents and kids. For instance, the child will be denied the love and affection which is of utmost importance to them. Moreover, not all children have the power to grasp things so early and this inability could lead the child to succumb to fear and could also make him feel inferior or defeated by his fellow mates.
To reiterate, it is clear that the practice of sending children to pre-school has both its advantages and advantages but the disadvantages are overshadowed by the advantages which assure the personal growth of the child.",8,some-parents-send-their-children-to-pre-school-when-they-are-three-or-four-years-old-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
299,Some people believe that schools should include competitive sports as a subject while others believe that it has negative effects on children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"According to some people competitive sports should be included in the school curriculum as one subject whereas others think that it can be disadvantageous to kids. I think this move has more pros than cons and schools ought to have competitive sports as a subject.
Having competitive sports such as football or swimming as a part of school curriculum can bring several benefits to children. Firstly, doing sports as a compulsory subject in schools can make youngsters fitter and more athletic and this will improve their physical health not only in their childhood but also in their adulthood. Research studies have shown that working out and doing physical exercise can help brain development; therefore, children who do sports will be physically and mentally healthier than those who do not engage in regular physical exercises. Moreover, playing a team sport such as football develop team spirit in children and teach them how to be a good team member. These are skills essential for their success in future.
On the other hand, having competitive sports as a subject in schools can lead to some problems as well. Children can sustain injury while playing games in competitive manners. In addition, sometimes, kids can become obsessed with winning all the time rather than enjoying the sports and team work. Besides, children who lack talents or skills in sports can lose self-esteem and this can have negative effects on their lives.
In conclusion, having competitive sports as part of school curriculum can bring both benefits and drawbacks for school children. However, in my opinion, the positive effects for children playing competitive sports at schools outweigh negative outcomes and schools should implement this policy for the sake of children.",8,some-people-believe-that-schools-should-include-competitive-sports-as-a-subject-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
300,Some believe that giving gifts and presents to family and friends is important to show them that we care. Others think that there are more important ways discuss both views and give your opinion,"Although it is believed that showering gifts is necessary to express love and care for family and friends, some believe that there are other significant ways to do so. I think gifting is waste of money and resources and one should opt for other ways to show adoration for important people in their life.
On the one hand, some believe that gifts and presents should be given because it instantly makes the other person feel elated and special. Undoubtedly, it will help to strengthen the bond with the receiver if that gift is of great value to them. However, this is not always the case and sometimes the gift we buy for them could be of no use to them. For example, when we buy a gift for our friend’s birthday there is a very high probability that another invitee will also bring the same present. In such situations, our gift may lay gathering dust in their attic. Also, gifts have a monetary value and it is not always possible to buy something that will make the receiver happy. More often than not, our gift will fall short of their expectations.
By contrast, spending time with our near and dear ones and offering them financial or other help when they need it the most is a much better way to show our love and concern for the,. Firstly, offering moral and financial support in situations of dire need is the most favourable thing that one can do for their family and friends. Another significant way is to share worthy belongings, knowledge and experiences with the loved ones especially children. This will eventually enable them to have a better future and in return respect for the person who shared these virtues, making the relationship stronger.
To conclude, while people may vary in their opinion, I think to demonstrate love and care for family and friends it is better to be generous / helpful to them during their difficulties in life than squandering money on unnecessary gifts and presents.",8,some-believe-that-giving-gifts-is-the-best-way-to-show-that-we-care-band-8-ielts-essay-sample

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is frequently believed that advancements in science will eventually lead people on the earth to have a lifespan of about a century or even more than that. While some people agree with this, there are others who strongly disagree with it. In my opinion, this increase in the lifespan of humans will aggravate the existing world problems further.
On the one hand, some believe that people should live for a 100 years or even more than that as it will help them to stay with their loved ones for an extended period of time . As there will be fewer deaths, the world will be a better place to live in with no sorrows and sadness over the death of the near ones. Moreover, the life span of intelligent and genius people can be extended which will help the world get more knowledgeable people and they can offer their guidance through their experiences of life to the upcoming generations.

In addition, this trend will lead to population explosion and will be detrimental to already existing global problems like food shortage, pollution and global warming, water crisis, accommodation issues and traffic congestion to mention some.

303,Some parents believe that reading books for entertainment is a waste of time for children and they think that their children should only read serious educational books. What is your opinion about this?,"There is a constant debate among parents on what their children should read. While some of them agree on reading entertaining book, others opine such material does not add any value to their lives and they should focus only on educational books. I strongly disagree with this view. In my opinion, all sorts of books provide knowledge and children should be encouraged to read whatever they like.
I strongly reckon that reading amusing books helps a child develop his creative side.  Multiple studies have been conducted all over the world to understand the development of a child’s mind. Furthermore, it has been proved that children at a young age learn from their environment. Reading such books makes them imaginative and channels their inner artistic side. Over the period of time, such books aid their personal development.
Young minds are impressionable and are budding with curiosity. Such books provide them with plenty of role models that they can look up to. They can be astronauts or even police officers who fight all odds to achieve the impossible. Furthermore, they learn to relate their life goals based on those of their idols. We should never deny our children access to such books as we might be jeopardising their future. Young minds tend to be more curious than focused and access to such books can help them satisfy such curiosity.
To conclude, while reading educational books is a must, they should not be the only priority. Entertaining books not only help children to choose their future, but also make them extra creative. Therefore, I strongly advise that we ought to let children have access to more entertaining books.",8,some-parents-believe-that-reading-books-for-entertainment-is-a-waste-of-time-for-children-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
304,Learning to play team sports is an important part of a child’s education. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Children are the tender buds of the society and they should be nurtured with great care. According to some people, kids’ education is incomplete if they are not exposed to team sports. I strongly agree with this thought as through team building games young ones learn numerous essential qualities such as team spirit and self confidence.
Firstly, by participating in any team sport such as football, basketball and cricket children learn to be part of a group. To illustrate, as per a Business Standard survey on Government school kids young ones who are part of any group sport activity are more cooperative, adjusting and good in coordinating than the ones who do not participate in any team sports.  Hence, team sports inculcate many values that are vital for the overall development of a kid.
Secondly, juveniles become more confident and sociable by becoming a team player. For instance, during my school days, I was a shy and introvert kid but after becoming a player in the school basketball team, I started interacting with other members which in turn engendered plethora of confidence in me and I became an extrovert. Therefore, team games give exposure to interact with others and to build confidence which improve the personality of a kid in multiple ways.
After analyzing the topic in depth, it is clear that group sports develop team spirit among the children. Moreover, they groom the overall personality of students. Therefore, team sports must be included in young one’s education curriculum for their proper growth and development.",8,learning-to-play-a-team-sport-is-an-important-part-of-a-childs-education-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
305,"Some people think that it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools. Others, however, believe that boys and girls benefit more from attending mixed schools. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","We know that education system plays a crucial role in shaping the future of our children. Many people believe that children should study in gender-specific schools whereas some argue that co-educational schools bring more benefit. This essay will discuss both sides and give my own opinion.
There are several positive aspects to teaching children / students in mixed schools. One of them is that boys and girls learn about how to respect each other. These schools help them to understand that both genders have equal rights and positions in society. For example, mixed education systems conduct a lot of extra-curricular activities to prove that boys and girls have the same potential to accomplish tasks. Another reason is that co-ed schools educate boys and girls to work in diversification. These schools educate how to understand a different gender in terms of biological factors, emotions and behaviors. Overall, mixed schools allow boys and girls to understand and respect each other in a society.
On the other hand, same sex schools have their own merits. These schools can spend time in educating one gender with more focus and can also teach students with new methodologies based on the gender.  For instance, a research from Oxford University shows that girls perform better in mathematics if they get lessons through real- life situations. Another benefit is that teachers do not hesitate to discuss the gender specific topic while teaching. To illustrate, I remember that reproduction cycle chapter from my school days. My biology instructor had to take a separate class for boys as she was embarrassed to discuss the topic in the class of mixed students. Therefore, same sex schools open a channel for teachers to widen their teaching skills and give liberty to discuss the study materials.
In conclusion, both types of schools have their own merits. I personally feel that co-ed schools are more beneficial because they enable boys and girls to work together in different areas of education. This helps them to grow in their future profession or careers.",8,some-people-think-that-it-is-better-to-educate-boys-and-girls-in-separate-schools-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
306,"Going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. While it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.","Studying abroad has become increasing popular among the student community. Despite the benefits it offers, some people believe that it is perhaps a good idea to pursue studies at home due to the cultural barriers a student will encounter overseas. I oppose this view because studying abroad enables them to gain invaluable life experiences and excellent career prospects.
First of all, students will gain knowledge and experience that they cannot acquire if they study in their own countries. Being in another country requires people to push themselves beyond the norm into unusually difficult circumstances. For instance, when I studied in Malaysia as a 20-year-old, I was continually pushed out of my comfort zone into psychological states that were unique and novel and I had to adapt to them no matter what. In fact, these ultra-challenging experiences are paradoxically the main advantage of living overseas as they make you grow as a person.
Another important aspect is that although people will come across certain cultural and linguistic challenges during their stay abroad, they will have ample job opportunities after completing their education. Getting a desirable job is extremely difficult in countries like India and Pakistan due to lack of ability to deal with foreign clients in their native language. Those individuals who spend a decent amount of time, which is usually four years for a university degree program, in another country get a better insight into the foreign culture, language and their work related requirements. As a result, they are more likely to be hired by companies in their home countries rather than others because of the exceptional abilities they possess. This eventually leads to better career prospects.
In conclusion, overseas education will benefit people to get a good job in their local country, and it will also make them a better person than they are today. In my opinion, students are far better off having studied in a different country despite the challenges that they will inevitably face.",8,going-overseas-for-university-study-is-an-exciting-prospect-for-many-people-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
307,"Some say that music, art and drama are as important as other school subjects, especially at the primary level. Do you agree or disagree?","Some argue that extracurricular activities, such as music, art and drama carry the same importance as other academic subjects at primary school level. I totally agree with this thought process as this is a crucial learning stage for a child and it also helps in enhancing their mental ability in other subjects.
Primary school is a crucial time for enhancing the learning ability of a child, as this is the time when their brain can develop a liking for a subject which is not imposed on them; therefore, their minds are independent to choose. This is because at this age neuron connections are still establishing in the brain. As a result, it is easy for the child to learn the basics of music, art and drama. For instance, in a study published by Stanford University, it was shown that the artists who started taking music, art and drama classes in their primary schools became more successful in their pursuits than their peers who started at a later stage.
Singing, drawing and acting are the skills known to enhance mental ability of a child. The reason for this is that the brain functions better when it is utilised for learning different interesting things. This is to say that minds of these children become very active and work much more efficiently than those who follow the monotonous academic curriculum at primary school. Consequently, they perform better than others in academic subjects too. For instance, in a report by Australian Education Board in 2017, it was stated that pupils of primary schools which taught music, art and drama classes achieved higher grades in academics than those in the schools which had no extracurricular activities.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that teaching music, art and acting classes at primary level not only allows the child to perform better in these fields, but also leads to overall development in other subjects too.",8,music-art-and-drama-are-as-important-as-other-school-subjects-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
308,There is a growing demand for fresh water nowadays and this is becoming a global problem. What are the causes and solutions?,"We are facing a global issue of increasing demand for fresh water. This essay will show / illustrate how population growth and unwise use of water have triggered this problem and how public awareness related to the topic can help in combating the challenge.
The massive growth in global population has increased the demand for fresh water. By analyzing history, it can be easily observed that the most significant increase in the population of world was witnessed during the last century. Secondly, human beings have started to use fresh water in a very irresponsible way. People especially those in big cities are wasting a lot of fresh water every day while washing their hands and taking showers.
Creating public awareness about the issue will help to resolve the problem. Governments should run media campaigns to communicate the risks that our future generations face due to our excessive use of water. If people realize/discover that there are several big cities in many parts of the world where people do not have access to fresh water anymore, they will consume water wisely. Academic books of schools should also include topics related to the careful use of water so that children can develop responsible behaviour at a very young age.
In conclusion, a whopping increase in the population of the world is the foremost reason behind the continuous surge in the demand for fresh water. Waste of water by human beings makes the situation even worse; therefore, public awareness should be raised to ensure that people consume water in a responsible way.",8,there-is-a-growing-demand-for-fresh-water-nowadays-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
309,Some people think that criminals who commit minor crimes should be made to do some unpaid community work rather than jailing them. Do you agree or disagree?,"Minor offences have become very common these days. A few individuals believe that those who commit them should be penalised and put behind bars. Others disagree with it and insist that these criminals should be forced / made to do some volunteer work for the society. I do not agree with this view because jailing is necessary for making criminals realize the repercussions of their action and if punishment is not given, minor crimes will eventually lead to major crimes.
Most criminals do not even realise that they have made a mistake when they carry it out on a small scale. This is due to the reason that a few countries like India and Pakistan do not sentence people to a term for committing petty criminal activities such as reckless driving, trespassing, and breaking traffic rules. Consequently, they keep on performing such things repetitively since they are aware that the government is not going to put them behind the bar. To make sure that everyone realizes their mistakes and learns a lesson from them, the criminals should be sent to jail for committing even minor/trivial offences.
Similarly, although making them do unpaid community service may be beneficial for the society, not prosecuting them for small crimes will encourage them to commit even more serious crimes. There have been a few recorded instances where crimes such as rape, murder, and kidnapping were executed by people who were already involved in smacking and eve-teasing and were not punished for the same. If these criminals had been punished then and there some major crimes could have been avoided.
In conclusion, making lawbreakers engage in voluntary work might help them feel better. However, in my opinion, sentencing them to a term is indispensable even for the minor crimes they commit so that they will not repeat them in future.",8,6461-2
310,"Some people believe that the purpose of prison is to punish, while others argue that rehabilitation is its primary role. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","While some people think that the objective of prisons is to punish criminals, others argue that the primary responsibility of prisons is to rehabilitate people. Judiciary operates in a country to dispense justice and to facilitate the rehabilitation of convicted criminals. Prisons play a crucial role in this. Hence, in my opinion, the main objective of prison is to rehabilitate criminals. Furthermore, this essay will argue that punishment does not help to reduce the crime rates.
Many people argue that prisons of a country aim to improve the behaviour / conduct of criminals through rehabilitation. This essay supports this notion because punishment can never help to have responsible and law abiding citizens. For instance, most of the criminals who decide to become good citizens after serving their time in prison believe that the reason behind their changed behaviour is the rehabilitation provided in the prison.
However, many people believe that the primary role of prisons should be to serve punishment to the people who do not respect the law. They think that governments should not spend tax money to rehabilitate criminals because punishment is enough to reduce the crime rates. This essay does not agree with this thinking because although punishment can help to serve the justice to people, it cannot help to reduce the crime rates. This is the reason why the crime rate is the lowest in most of the European countries that treat prisons as rehabilitation centres.
In conclusion, the judicial system is supposed to improve the behaviour of people and this can be achieved only when the prisons provide rehabilitation to the criminals. Moreover, punishment should not be considered as the primary responsibility of prisons because it does not help to reduce the crimes rates in a society.",8,some-people-believe-that-the-purpose-of-prison-is-to-punish-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
311,"Some people think that people in senior positions alone should make decisions in a business, while others think that employees should be involved in the decision-making process too. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","While some people think that all the decisions should be made by people in key positions, others think that employees should also be involved in this process. In my opinion, it is better for the company when people in senior positions take important decisions because they have a greater understanding of the business.
Moreover, the primary objective of a business is to generate profits; therefore, catering to employees’ sense of ownership should be considered only as a second priority. People in key positions have access to the information about all the aspects of the company. By contrast, people in junior positions have understanding of only their departments; therefore, they should not be involved in key decisions. This essay fully supports this idea because it is really crucial to consider the impacts of a decision on all the activities of the company. Furthermore, people argue that the speed of decision making increases when fewer people are involved in the process.
On the other hand, several people think that employees should also be involved in the decision making process because it will help them feel that they are part of the management team. They believe that it will increase their sense of ownership and that will eventually lead to a higher level of motivation. I do not agree with this notion because generation of profits is the key objective of almost every company. It is important that steps are taken to increase the motivation level of employees but it should not be the first priority.
In conclusion, decisions should be taken by people in key positions because they have access to the information related to all the aspects of the organization. Employees’ involvement is unnecessary because it takes a long time to gather opinions. Moreover, the primary objective of companies is to generate profits and not to involve employees in the decision making process.",8,people-in-senior-positions-alone-should-make-decisions-in-a-business-band-8-ielts-essay-sample

Get your IELTS essays, letters and reports corrected by me.","It goes without saying that the development of technologies has had a huge influence on us. In view of this, I am convinced that technologies help us to solve different tasks in far more productive ways.
To begin with, technologies in principle were created to help people solve different tasks faster and better. People face numerous challenges in areas of education, work, health, finance and governance. Many of these tasks are hard and time consuming. And technologies can make such tasks more comfortable. For example, with the help of distance learning we can receive education any time and from anywhere. This allows us to spend time in more efficient ways to learn a few more skills, for instance. Furthermore, technologies improve the quality and speed of our workflow a lot. That is to say calculations that were done by computer are obviously more accurate than those done by humans, because risk of making errors / mistakes is non-existent. Moreover, those tasks that required 1 hour of our time in the past now can be done in just 5 minutes with the help of the computer.
Another argument in favor of my statement is that technologies help us to become more efficient in our communication with other people. We can keep in touch with people regardless of their location by using the internet. In other words, we can promote our social interaction indefinitely.
To conclude, I think that positive influence of technologies on our life is obvious. Technologies not only help us to be efficient at work and study, but also contribute to productive social interaction.",8,has-technology-made-us-more-efficient-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
313,A growing number of cities are making their centres pedestrian-only zones. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?,"The central areas of many cities can now only be accessed by pedestrians. This essay will prove that this trend helps to improve mobility of people in centers; however, it also creates challenges for the businesses operating in centres.
Without vehicles centres are easily accessible and the mobility of people increases. Centres of cities are supposed to be very crowded with people because most of the establishments within the city are located in these areas. The situation becomes even worse when vehicles are also allowed to enter these areas. Extreme traffic makes it very difficult to access town centres and this affects the business negatively. Unfortunately, not allowing vehicles in this area also affects downtown businesses negatively.
Most of businesses heavily rely on vehicles to receive goods from other areas of city. They also use these vehicles to deliver their goods to the addresses of customers. With a ban on vehicles, businesses find it very difficult to sustain their operations in traditional ways and they have to look for alternatives that are often not cost effective. This is the reason whenever a government decides to designate a centre as a pedestrian-only area, the decision faces immense resistance from the companies operating in these areas.
In conclusion, although pedestrian-only centres can increase the mobility of people by eliminating the traffic caused by vehicles, they create problems for the companies operating in these areas. Because most of these companies rely on vehicles to transport goods, they are forced to arrange expensive alternatives when the vehicles are not allowed to enter the centres.",8,many-cities-are-making-their-centres-pedestrian-only-zones-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
314,"Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?","It is argued that governments are wasting their resources by paying for the preservation of arts and that they would be better off spending the funds on public sectors. While it is crucial to increase spending on public services such as education or transportation, governments should not cut all their expenses on arts.
On the one hand, improving public services is crucial for the development of a country. For example, when the funds are utilised for traffic projects like road maintenance or public transportation, the number of traffic accidents will reduce, and people can plan their trips better around the city thanks to frequent bus and train services. Furthermore, with sufficient funding, the authorities can keep public workers happy and avoid their going on strikes. Imagine all teachers in a city stop teaching for a day to protest against low wages. It would lead to classes being cancelled, and parents having to stay home to look after their schoolchildren. That would be a very troublesome / difficult situation for families and offices alike.
On the other hand, it is equally important to spend on arts. If the officials decided to stop spending on music and theatre, it would be a serious mistake and could result in the loss of national identity. We all know that arts and culture are interrelated. If a country does not emphasize on preserving arts, the cultural aspects associated with traditional music and theatre will gradually disappear. The nation will in turn lose their cultural uniqueness, which is of great importance for tourism. If travellers find nothing extraordinary about a culture, it is less likely that they will make that country their desired destination.
In conclusion, I am against the idea of governments cutting all investment in arts to spend on public services. The authorities should balance their spending between these two sectors so public services can operate smoothly and at the same time cultural diversity and uniqueness can be maintained.",8,government-investment-in-the-arts-is-a-waste-of-money-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
315,"It is very clear now that English should be the primary foreign language taught in all schools around the world. Learning a different foreign language before English, in today’s world, is a waste of time. Do you agree or disagree?","Undoubtedly English has become the lingua franca; it is, therefore, suggested that learning any foreign language other than English is merely a squandering of precious time, and English should be taught as an elementary language in all learning institutions across the globe. However, I can only partially agree with this view. While it is true that English offers numerous benefits to people, it is up to each individual to decide which foreign language they want to learn.
To start with, the reason why English should be taught globally is that it is spoken and understood worldwide. Those who have a strong command of this language have more lucrative job offers than those who do not possess its knowledge. To cite an example, MNCs have been established in many parts of the world especially in developing nations, and they prefer candidates with fluency in English / flawless communication skills in English. Hence, starting to learn this language at a young age / starting to learn this language early is the only way to grasp it completely. In addition, knowledge of English serves as academic credentials. To elaborate it, a good English user is considered highly knowledgeable in even non- English speaking countries.
Furthermore, widespread use of English has made geographical barriers insignificant. These days individuals tend to travel to other countries more than ever before, as this language makes it easier for people to know about the culture and tradition of other lands; consequently, tourism is booming. Therefore, in order to enjoy sightseeing English is vital. Even so, if someone has a passion to learn other foreign languages, it cannot be stated as a waste of time or money. Learning is always useful and has many advantages either directly or indirectly.
In conclusion, learning English certainly has its merits and every student should have the opportunity to master it; however, the argument that learning any other foreign language is a waste of time is absurd because learning is always useful and may offer some benefit or other.

316,Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"While some people opine that competition should be instilled in children, others disagree with this notion and believe that cooperation is more important, because by learning it children can become more useful adults. In my opinion, competition is more important than cooperation. This essay will discuss how growth is directly linked with the wish to compete, and although children can feel pressure because of the immense competition, it is better that they get familiar with such pressure at the early stage of their lives.
Competition motivates people to outperform others because it allows them to assess their performance against the performance of others. This essay supports this point of view because it is commonly observed that the students of the schools where academic performance is graded and ranked with the objective of promoting competition do better in studies than the students of those institutes that do not follow the same methodology.
People who support cooperation believe that the sense of competition puts unnecessary pressure on children; therefore, a relaxed environment where students can learn and cooperate with one another should be provided to them. I disagree with this thinking because it is crucial for children to cope with the pressure to compete during their childhood itself.
Moreover, it is often observed that children with difficult childhood perform better in practical life than other children. The reason is that difficulties faced at a younger age makes them well prepared for the challenges of adulthood.
In conclusion, although the sense of competition can make the childhood more stressful, it increases the probability of success in the practical life. Therefore, children should be encouraged to compete with each others at an early stage of life, as it will help them to become stronger and better human beings.",8,a-sense-of-competition-should-be-encouraged-in-children-band-8-ielts-essay-sample

Every nation faced challenges in the past and sometimes wrong decisions taken in those situations resulted in undesirable outcomes. People can learn from these mistakes and take better decisions in case they face similar circumstances again. This essay agrees with this notion, because it can be easily observed that almost every developed country gives significant importance to history, which shows that a willingness to learn from the past mistakes helps in achieving economic and social milestones.
However, many people argue that the historical situations are not comparable / can never be compared to the current scenarios. These people think that world has changed in so many different ways that learning about the history is useless. This essay does not agree with this thinking because history has repeated itself many times. For instance, Pakistan and India suffered huge losses when they fought their first war against each other; however, both countries did not learn from their mistakes, and consequently they were forced to fight several subsequent battles.
In conclusion, nations can control their present and shape their future by learning from the mistakes committed in the history. Although dynamics of the world have changed significantly over the period of time, history tends to repeat itself; therefore, it is always useful to study the past and to anticipate similar situations.

318,Some people believe that children are given too much free time. They feel that this time should be used to do more school work. How do you think children should spend their free time?,"It is often thought by some people that children are given an excessive amount of free time and they think this time ought to be utilized to do more school work. I do not agree with this view.
To begin with, I think children should spend their free time playing games and engaging in other physical activities because they spend at least 6 to 8 hours at school and are given too much homework to do at their homes. This is because they need to stay fit and healthy throughout the year in order to study and obtain good grades.  To illustrate, recent studies conducted by the National Education Organisation revealed that children spending their free time on physical activities along with school work acquired higher grades than those spending all their time on school work. Moreover, when they play games with other children at the playground, they get a chance to meet different people with whom they can make friends and they can be stress-free. If children were to do school work in their free time, they would miss some crucial benefits like making friends with other people and being healthy.
There are other essential activities such as yoga, and other essential classes which should be imparted to children since they are bestowed with academic knowledge at the school itself. The reason for this is that they play a pivotal role in gaining general knowledge which is a must in today’s world. For instance, many children who spend most of their time on classroom work have less general knowledge than those who use their time for playing games and participating in other physical activities. If children allocate their free time to spend on these activities, they will definitely attain high grades and will be able to socialize with others later in their lives.
In conclusion, even though children spending all of their time on school work can obtain some benefits, in my opinion, they can stay healthy and secure good grades and communication skills if they spend their free time on physical games and other activities.

319,More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people say that increasing the price of fattening foods will solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that many people are getting too fat these days, and it is the most serious health concern of the day. In order to address this problem, some opine that the prices of unhealthy foods should be increased. While I agree with this point to some extent as this can stop people from eating too much fast foods, I would also argue that other measures are necessary to uproot this mammoth problem.
To begin with, if the price of the junk foods which make people corpulent is increased, then they will seldom buy these types of items because of the high cost. A recent survey published in Hindustan Times, a well-known Indian newspaper, gives evidence that by imposing extra tax on the high-calorie foods, like burgers, cakes, and pastries, the Delhi government encouraged their residents to cut the consumption of these food items by a half. However, this cannot fully overcome the issue of overweight / obesity because it is nearly impossible to stop people from craving for fast foods even after increasing their prices.
Nevertheless, the other method that can play a pivotal role in tackling this conundrum is to motivate people to do more physical activities. The reason for this is that most of the people, especially in the big cities, do the desk job where they have to sit on a chair for the whole day; that is why lack of physical movement of the body is making them obese. The best we can do in this scenario is to create awareness among people about the benefits of body exercise and encourage them to spare some time from the day for their physical well-being. Consequently, adopting these habits might succour people to overcome the issue of heavy body weight.
To recapitulate, it is undeniable that myriads of people, nowadays, are gaining a lot more weight. Although making fattening food pricey for the general people can reduce this issue to some extent, to fully eradicate this issue people should get up from their couches and engage in physical activity.",8,more-and-more-people-are-becoming-seriously-overweight-band-8-ielts-essay-sample-2
320,There is an increasing trend around the world of married couples deciding not to have children. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for couples who decide to do this.,"An increasing number of couples around the world are taking the decision not to have kids. In my opinion, childless couples can have a more financially stable life; however, they may face many problems when they reach their retirement age.
The foremost benefit of not having children is the availability of disposable income. The cost of raising a child has surged during the last few decades and it has become very difficult to manage the school fees, healthcare costs & other expenses related to kids. Without the responsibility of children, couples can have more financial freedom. A research paper published in the Wall Street Journal reported that American couples without kids had 60% more savings than those who had at least one or more kids to raise.
However, there are also a few drawbacks to this trend. The most significant problem is that when the couples grow old, they lack the emotional and financial support. It is very common that the kids support their old parents financially and spend time taking care of them. Such assistance is not available to the people who decide to live their lives without children. It impacts the satisfaction and happiness of these people. For instance, a survey carried out by Harvard University claimed that the Americans living without children are 65% more likely to face depression and anxiety.
In conclusion, although the lack of kids can provide an opportunity to have more financial savings, there are negative consequences. Couples without children tend to have less satisfied life after the retirement age because there is nobody to take care of them.",8,there-is-an-increasing-trend-around-the-world-of-married-couples-deciding-not-to-have-children-band-8-ielts-essay-sample

322,Earlier technological developments brought more benefits than recent technological developments. To what extent do you agree?,"It is believed that the primitive advancements in technology are comparatively more beneficial than the ones in the modern era. However, I am not convinced of perception and strongly opine that latest inventions are more advantageous to general public.
The first merit of contemporary technological developments is their easy affordability. Due to mass production policies, the cost of various commodities dropped considerably. Owing to this, people can easily afford these at competitive prices. Mobile phone is a primary example as it is now accessible / affordable to almost every individual which was not possible earlier.
Secondly, convenience is another positive aspect of modern technology. With the help of research and development centres, the bulky parts of machines have been replaced with lighter yet stronger material. As a result, it is easier to carry them from one place to another. Modern computers, for example, are sleek and speedy in comparison to earlier room sized scientific computers.
Thirdly, the modern technology is more eco-friendly and durable than its older versions. Subtle modifications and up-gradations make the products more environment friendly by reducing their emissions. To exemplify, latest steel manufacturing units set up by Tata group produces approximately seventy percent less carbon dioxide than the earlier machines. In this way environment can be protected from the harmful emissions produced by the use of technology.
To conclude, new improvements in technology have proved to have greater positive impacts on the environment and the society than older ones.",8,earlier-technological-developments-brought-more-benefits-than-recent-technological-developments-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
323,The computer is widely used in education and some people think teachers do not play an important role in the classroom. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Invented less than a hundred years ago, computers are an indispensable part of the human life today and are used everywhere, even inside the classrooms. With the increasing popularity of the computers in the education, many people ponder if they will eventually replace the teachers in the classroom. In my opinion, this is very unlikely as teachers play a pivotal role in our lives and cannot be replaced.
Firstly, computers are man-made machines which can store a huge amount of knowledge. Despite this, they are not programmed to think creatively and cannot manage students from different cultural backgrounds. Teaching in a classroom requires individual attention and creativity as children have different caliber and pace at which they learn and absorb things. For instance, a child suffering from dyslexia will require special attention and care while studying and only a teacher can provide this.
Secondly, students can relate to and understand the situation better when a personal touch or examples are involved. Teachers fulfill this requirement by supporting the theoretical studies with the relevant examples about a scenario. In addition, teachers organize different class-room activities such as group discussions and debates to keep students engaged and make learning a fun and frolic experience. Moreover, a teacher can notice even a slight change in a student’s attitude and behaviour and rectify it with proper guidance. Without this kind of interaction and understanding, learning and teaching will be ineffective.
In conclusion, even though computers are a part of our daily routines teachers play an important role in shaping the lives of an individual by enlightening their paths and making them a better citizen and thus, the role played by teachers in education can’t be overlooked.",8,now-that-computers-are-used-in-education-some-people-think-teachers-do-not-play-any-role-in-education-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
324,"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","According to some people, during the hiring process the recruiter ought to look for the personal attributes of applicants instead of their experience and qualifications. I disagree with this viewpoint because a qualified candidate possesses the right skill set and insight which a non-qualified individual may lack despite having an amicable personality. Secondly, an experienced person could bring new technological advancement and has a lot to offer to the organisation. I will support my viewpoint in the subsequent paragraphs.
First and foremost, a well-qualified person possesses the right skill set and knowledge required to land a job. As this is a world of specialisation, recruiters prefer to find / appoint a person with numerous skills instead of interpersonal qualities. For instance, corporates tend to hire only those individuals who attained their degree in a specific field as they feel that the person could perform better than a less-qualified individual.
Furthermore, it is thought by some recruiters that an experienced candidate could give new technological progression to the organisation. All the methodologies and processes that an experienced employee brings with them help the firm to ameliorate their current business process to fetch more profits. For example, start-ups prefer to hire people who familiar with the business models of their competitors. Admittedly, people with pleasant personalities are good for handling clients. Personally I believe that personal attributes are crucial only in positions that require a lot of l interactions with the public. For back end jobs experience and academic qualifications are more important.
In conclusion, it is obvious that a degree-holder has the right skill sets and know-how to perform his duties better. Moreover, an experienced champ perhaps offers a new formula to maximize the company’s earnings. Amicable personality traits are certainly beneficial; however, they are never a substitute for academic qualifications or work experience.",8,employer-should-pay-attention-to-the-personal-qualities-of-employees-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
325,"Sometimes people think that young people should be encouraged to leave their family at a certain age, while others think that it is better for them to remain with their family. What is your view?","According to some people, youngsters ought to be motivated to leave their family when they reach a certain age; others disagree. They think that children will benefit more if they stay with their family; however, I agree with the former group. In my opinion, young children will be transformed to independent individuals and they will also have an incredible career growth once they leave home.
First, permitting children to stay away from their home will enable them to think and act freely. In other words, this will assist youngsters to develop their decision-making skills. Also, the experiences they gain from the outside world, along with the struggles and challenges of the new environment, will undoubtedly help them in many ways. A recent study by the University of Delhi found that 75% of the youngsters who live independently are good decision makers. It also states that they are successful at differentiating the good and bad aspects of life.
Second, children get a plethora of opportunities to explore the world while they are away from their home. When they reach the initial phase of their career, they will be induced with knowledge of different career options available in the job market. Furthermore, this will guide them to choose a career in which they can work energetically and enthusiastically, thus, leading to a satisfying work life.
In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinion I strongly reckon that young children should be allowed to leave their home after a certain age. This will undeniably improve their thinking process as well as secure their future career.",8,young-children-should-be-encouraged-to-leave-family-at-a-certain-age-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
326,Plastic shopping bags contribute to the pollution of land and sea. Some people think they should be banned. Do you agree or disagree?,"Plastic bag usage is increasing at an alarming rate, and it is one of the main causes of land and sea pollution as people often dispose of them after one time use. I totally agree with the opinion that governments should gradually prohibit them from being used for shopping purposes.
Firstly, plastic bags have a detrimental effect on the environment because they are non-biodegradable. This means that it may take hundreds of years for a plastic carrier to decompose into pieces. Therefore, when the bags are buried into the soil or thrown into the ocean and wild animals eat them, plastic will enter the food chain, causing major issues and even death when ingested. For example, a hungry turtle may mistake a transparent plastic bag for a jellyfish and eat it. If that happens repeatedly, it is likely that the turtle will choke on the plastic it cannot digest and die painfully.
Besides, plastic bags consist of many toxic chemicals which will negatively impact the surroundings when they are burnt. These harmful by-products will be released into the air, resulting in the gradual development of deadly diseases like cancer when people inhale them too frequently. The chemicals may also affect the fertility of the soil. This is because the roots of these plants may not be able to penetrate through plastic particles to get nutrients from the soil. As a result, the growth of crops will slow down, leading to reduction in yield.
In conclusion, I am in favour of the contention that there should be regulations to ban the use of plastic because of the detrimental impacts it has on our environment.",8,plastic-shopping-bags-should-be-banned-because-they-pollute-land-and-sea-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
327,Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? Suggest solutions to change the negative attitude.,"It is true that global tourism has become a prevalent phenomenon. Some people argue that this industry impinges on their nations. I believe that the negative attitude towards it is because of vandalism and environmental issues. However, in order to deal with this attitude, governments should introduce regulations and policies to manage international tourism.
The main reason why local people do not support international tourism is that numerous foreign tourists do not show their respect to local cultures. It is evident that various local heritage sites need to be renovated due to the damage caused by travellers. For example, a variety of indigenous caves in Taiwan were vandalised by people from overseas. In addition, the local environment can be severely polluted when the number of tourists increases, contributing to air or soil pollution. This is because they throw rubbish into surroundings irresponsibly.
However, my strongly held belief is that these problems can be solved by imposing restrictions on international tourism. Firstly, fining people who commit vandalism is necessary as it can deter them from breaking the law. If tourists need to pay a large amount of fine for their behaviour, it is highly likely that they will avoid committing crimes. Additionally, the policy of limiting the number of tourists should be introduced to mitigate pollution. If a nation only accepts 1000 foreigners to apply for the tourist VISA monthly, environmental pollution certainly can be alleviated. Once these problems are dealt with, local people will change their attitudes to global tourism.
In conclusion, although many residents are against international tourism due to vandalism and pollution resulting from tourist activity, governments can change this attitude by enacting laws that limit the damage caused by tourists.",8,many-people-believe-that-international-tourism-is-a-bad-thing-for-their-countries-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
328,Some people say that the main way to be happy in life is to have a lot of money. How might having a lot of money make people happy? What other things in life can make people happy?,"It is argued that possessing a huge amount of money is the best way to achieve happiness in life. Undeniably, money can fulfil the materialistic needs of an individual who seeks elation from such accomplishments. However, money is not the only key to happiness. There are other ways as well and simple everyday things like enjoying a hot coffee on a cold morning or sharing the dinner table with loved ones can also make us happy and delighted. Helping people in need such as homeless children and destitute sections of the society is another way to find happiness in life.
First and foremost, people who are financially sound could easily fulfil the materialistic needs and desires of their life which in return gives them a sense of satisfaction. Compared to middle class people, the affluent sections of the society can easily satisfy their materialistic needs and wants like buying high end cars, travelling to exotic locations or wearing expensive brands. Furthermore, the rich people have the luxury of getting the best health-care treatments which is not exactly available to the common man.
On the flip side, apart from materialistic wants, an individual can seek happiness from various other things. One of them is sharing the dining table with family after a tiring day at office. Certainly, eating with the loved ones automatically eliminates stress and worries. Secondly, rendering help to poor and needy could also give some sense of achievement. For example, financial aid to people who seek medical help probably is the best way to embrace elation.
To conclude, admittedly, it is quite evident from the aforementioned instances that money buys you all the materialistic comforts in the world. Nevertheless, spending time with close ones and helping the impoverished could also bring delight.",8,the-main-way-to-be-happy-in-life-is-to-have-a-lot-of-money-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
329,Tourism is encouraged in many countries. Does tourism bring more advantages or disadvantages to a country?,"Most of the nations across the globe promote tourism. In my opinion, the advantages tourism can have on a nation’s economy and development are greater than any disadvantages.
The primary benefit of encouraging tourism is that it is a profitable source of income for many countries. In other words, tourists provide a plethora of opportunities for the natives and the nation to earn money. Because of this rising demand for tourism, many youngsters are employed in different sectors which circuitously assist to reduce the unemployment rate in many countries. Thus, a nation with lower unemployment and higher sources of income will lift their laurel beyond imagination
Similarly, to attract more foreigners to the country, the government and the public will make efforts to improve the infrastructure of cities and towns. Furthermore, they become more concerned about retaining the natural resources and conserving the countryside as most visitors enjoy visiting and appreciating the beauty of the countryside. Therefore, it is obvious that encouraging tourism apparently paves the way to protect the environment and its resources from many threats.
Despite the above-mentioned advantages, I admit that there are some disadvantages to promoting tourism. One such issue is the chances of spreading of any communicable disease. Fortunately, health sectors are now developed in such a way that medical tests and health checkups are done appropriately to ensure the safety of the locals and the tourists from any contagious diseases. Hence, such concerns do not hold much water.
In conclusion, undoubtedly, tourism plays an integral part in escalating a nation’s revenue and it indirectly helps in the development and protection of the rural and urban areas. Therefore, I think that the demerits are negligible compared to the merits.",8,does-tourism-bring-more-advantages-or-disadvantages-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
330,"Many parents believe that when their children read books for entertainment, they are wasting their time, and that they should only read serious, educational books. What is your opinion about this?","According to some parents, children ought to read only books with educational importance and reading books for entertainment is a waste of time. In my opinion, children should not be restricted to read only certain genre of books because both the entertainment and educational books serve the purpose of imparting positive skills in children.
Some parents think that children should be motivated to read only educational books and not comics and fiction which are not worth their time. They think so because educational books impart knowledge and information that help children with their studies and future progress. Furthermore, these books provide relevant and real information about incidents happening across the globe which eventually enable children to explore the world through books. Undoubtedly, I admit that the role of educational books in children’s intellectual growth is crucial and hence, undeniable.
Regarding entertainment books, I do not agree with the view that reading short stories, novels or fiction for fun is a waste of time. The stories and the incidents narrated in these books conspicuously improve children’s creativity and imagination. Moreover, serious facts and events in academic texts can make reading a boring activity for them while entertainment books kindle their interest, boost their reading skills and thus, transform them into voracious readers in future. Unlike academic texts, which contain a plethora of technical terms and usages, the simple language in story books enables children to grasp the ideas easily.
In conclusion, educational books are useful for developing children’s intelligence and study skills whereas entertainment books help in their overall development. Therefore, I think that reading entertainment books should not be considered as a waste of time; rather, they should be given the same importance as other books.",8,many-parents-believe-that-reading-entertainment-books-is-a-waste-of-time-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
331,Children today are too dependent on computers and electronic entertainment. It would be better for them to be outside playing sports and taking part in more traditional pastimes than spending all day indoors. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In today’s world, children are obsessed with electronic gizmos. Experts have argued that it is essential for youngsters to play outdoor activities rather than staying at home and playing computer games. I am fully in favour of this idea and in this essay I will support my view with valid arguments and examples.
The main reason why I support the thesis is that it helps them to have better physical health. Nowadays, most of the youngsters are overweight and this is because they do not participate in sports which require physical activities. Playing sports such as basketball and football can help juveniles to get rid of fatigue that creeps into their day during the course of the day; thus, it keeps them mentally and psychologically healthy. Moreover, playing outdoor sports enhances their blood circulation and increases their metabolism. By contrast, if teenagers stay indoors for longer hours, they will not burn the extra calories they have gained from eating fast food; hence, they will be overweight.
In addition to this, taking part in outdoor sports can enhance their social skills. Children can brush up their communication skills, problem solving skills, and leadership skills when they play outdoor sports. Playing cricket, for example, not only makes the youngster physically fit, but also teaches them how to communicate with their team mates, how to cope with a difficult situation and how to take informed decisions. The argument goes that if juveniles are kept busy playing with their Play Stations, they will lack independent decision making skills throughout their life.
In conclusion, I reiterate that I fully support this argument that youngsters should engage in outdoor activities as it will assist them to have better health. In addition to this, it develops certain invaluable social skills in them. Nevertheless, it is important to strike a balance between studies and outdoor activities so that their academic performance does not suffer.",8,it-is-better-for-children-to-be-outside-playing-sports-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
332,"Some people think that libraries are no longer important, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Public libraries have always been the treasure house of knowledge and information. However, some people opine that they have become irrelevant. In my opinion, libraries have certainly lost some of their importance; however, this does not mean that they are no longer needed.
To begin with, the internet is ubiquitous; moreover, it is cost-effective and convenient in terms of one’s quest for knowledge. These days, if someone has access to an electronic device like computer or mobile phone, they can find an infinite amount of information on any topic in a fraction of seconds. Therefore, surfing the internet is a lot easier than visiting a library to get access to the books. Moreover, the internet offers up-to-date information on any topic on one’s mind. Thus, people who have access to the internet may not have to visit libraries.
Nevertheless, public libraries are the store house of many ancient yet valuable resources that cannot be found online or on websites. Furthermore, not everyone is fortunate enough to have round the clock internet connectivity. Also, there are plenty of research theses, articles and manuscripts that have never made their way to the internet. So, there is no possible way to find this information on any research websites; hence, paying a visit to the local library is the only way to get some insight into these resources. Secondly, in many developing countries, people are still struggling to meet both ends; the internet is still a luxury for them and the library is the only gateway to knowledge and information.
To conclude, undoubtedly, libraries have lost some of their significance. Yet, they are still very much needed because information stored in a library is authentic and reliable. Also, libraries cater to the needs of people belonging to all socio-economic backgrounds.",8,some-people-think-that-libraries-are-no-longer-important-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
333,Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It argued by some individuals that increasing the price of fuel for automobiles is an effective method to resolve environmental issues. I strongly agree with this statement and believe that the rise in the fuel rates will discourage people from using personal vehicles frequently. In addition to this people will also be more inclined to using electric cars which will result in reduced levels of air and sound pollution.
To begin with, increasing the price of fuel will force people to limit the usage of personal cars. This will result in reduced amount of carbon dioxide emissions into the earth’s atmosphere which in turn will help in lowering pollution levels. For instance, a person who uses a vehicle everyday for commuting to work will be willing to access public transportation in order to deal with increased fuel rates instead of driving his/her own car. Hence, hike in fuel prices can aid in resolving environmental issues by making it difficult for the public to use personal vehicles on a daily basis.
Another reason why increasing fuel charges is beneficial for the environment is that the public will be more inclined to buying electric cars rather than fossil fuel cars. Advancements in technology have helped in developing safe and budget friendly electric cars that are affordable for the general public. For example, Ellon Musk, CEO of Tesla motors has launched their first low price model which fully operates by using electricity resulting in zero gas emissions. Therefore, people would be encouraged to use electric cars as the costs involved in charging them are significantly lower than the cost of fuel.
In conclusion, I believe that though people know the seriousness of global warming and other environmental issues we are facing today they still fail to act. Thus, raising the fuel prices will be a great means to combat environmental issues as it will not only be difficult for individuals to afford usage of personal vehicles but it also encourages them to use electric cars which are cheaper.",8,increasing-the-cost-of-fuel-is-the-best-way-to-solve-environmental-problems-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
334,"With pressure on today’s young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects should be removed from the syllabus so that the children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is no denying the fact that school children are under tremendous pressure to perform well in academics. It is no secret that the students who score high grades in academics are more likely to have a successful career in the future compared to their counterparts, who score average or below-average. Many schools offer these days both academic and non- academic subjects in their curriculum to ensure the holistic growth of their students’ minds. There are many arguments about whether schools should adopt an all-inclusive approach or drop out vocational subjects that add no value to the intellect of a child’s mind. In my opinion, non academic subjects are immensely beneficial to the pupils because they enable them to master a versatile set of stills.
To begin with, there are many reasons to include vocational subjects in the curriculum. Firstly, by learning art and craft students can overcome the performance pressure imposed on them by parents and teachers. These activities like dance, drama, singing, cookery or physical education cause no unnecessary strain on learning minds. In fact, they provide relaxation and help these brainers to concentrate better on academic subjects. Also, learning these subjects is indispensable for the overall development of children.
Additionally, pupils with innate artistic or other talents can hone them when they get to practice those talents at school and become eminent performers of tomorrow. For example, a renowned cricketer was discovered by his sports teacher while he was playing in the school playground. Thanks to his teacher’s encouragement, he later pursed cricket and became unbeatable at the cricket ground. Thus it is evident that learning non-academic subjects at school will help not only the students but also the society.
To conclude, it is utterly ridiculous to eliminate non-academic subjects from the syllabus. In my opinion, schools should encourage to pursue a career in a field of their choice. This would not be feasible without including a wide range of topics in the curriculum.",8,some-people-believe-that-non-academic-subjects-should-be-removed-from-the-syllabus-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
335,Many processed foods and ready-made meals contain preservatives and chemicals. What are the advantages to this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is an irrefutable fact that chemicals such as flavour enhancers, preservatives, artificial colours and various stabilizers are added to convenient meals. Although there are certain advantages to this practice such as increase in the life of a product and enhancement of taste, the main drawbacks are that it has harmful effects in the long run and these chemicals make a person addicted to these foods. In my opinion, the disadvantages of these chemicals outweigh the advantages they offer.
Admittedly, there are some basic benefits to using these chemicals in the food. The first one is that it helps to increase the shelf-life of a product. This is because generally the life of the food is short and this makes them easily perishable. In order to tackle this issue, the manufacturers add these chemicals. For example, at least 98% of the processed food contains preservatives to add life and freshness to the product. Another advantage is that it enhances the taste and flavour of the food. In other words, these chemicals make the food more delicious regardless of their impact on one’s health and as a result, companies make a lot of profit.
Despite the advantages above, I believe that there are some serious drawbacks to this trend. One potential issue is that these chemicals have a long lasting impact on one’s health. This is because they can cause serious health ailments such as cardiac issues, cancer and may also damage the central nervous system. Another disadvantage is that these chemicals are addictive in nature. This encourages a person to eat these foods very often and thereby increases the chances of these health ailments.

336,The average standard of people’s health is likely to be lower in the future than it is now. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is considered by some people that the future standard of health and well-being of the society will probably be low as compared to today’s state. I completely agree with this opinion as there are manifold reasons for this.
To begin with, pollution is a prime contributing factor to the deterioration of people’s health. This is to say that due to modernization, people suffer from air, water and noise pollution. This will definitely continue in the future because the population will increase. This extremely affects our children when they commute to school or during their play outdoors and, in turn, negatively impacts the health level of the future generation. To illustrate this effect, a recent study by a well-known newspaper reveals that the majority of Asian children aged below 10 years suffer from respiratory diseases. This clearly shows that long-term diseases start from childhood.
Another important factor that contributes to decreasing the health standard is the poor agricultural techniques that include more usage of harmful pesticides and fertilizers. As a result, the food items such as rice, vegetables, and fruits get contaminated with the residue of these chemicals. If this continues, the future generation will not be able to consume uncontaminated healthy food. This will certainly lead to some diseases and an overall decline in health. A recent survey states that 85% of diseases are caused by the poor quality food consumed by people.
To sum up, the level of health and well-being of people will probably decline in the future because of the growing levels of pollution and poor agriculture techniques.

337,Students prefer doing part-time jobs during their studies. What are the advantages or disadvantages of this?,"On several occasions, when we enter a restaurant or receive a home delivery, a student wearing a work cloak is on the other end providing the service. There are several factors that encourage students to take up part time jobs and this trend has both positive and negative aspects.
To start with the benefits, the youth reap a lot of benefits by working part-time. The extra source of income aids them in supporting the family besides covering their own expenses. If a student is prudent enough to acquire a position in a field relevant to their study, then the work experience elevates the standard of their resume. Students also learn effective time management when they work part time. Furthermore, an organised lifestyle impedes the youth from indulging in undesirable activities.
On the down side, working while studying leaves the students with less or no time to nurture their hobbies or talents. What’s more, students working part time have to handle a lot of pressure at such a tender age. It could even hurt their performance at school or university because they may not have enough time for their studies. Many studies have proved that the academic output of youngsters with part-time job is not on par with their counterparts who do not work part time.
In conclusion, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that working from home has both merits and demerits. If students choose to work, care should be taken to ensure that their health or studies are not affected.

338,Many people are now opting to provide technology companies with their personal data in exchange for access to software. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"A majority of people choose to give software companies access to their personal information so that they can use a software application for free. People can use the software for myriads of fruitful purposes; however, in my opinion, because of the fact that corporations can misuse the private data for their own benefits, the advantages of this practice do not outweigh the disadvantages.
By giving access to information such as email address to a technology company, people can have full right to make use of the application for their indispensable needs. This can make their life more convenient and less laborious. For example, you must allow your camera and photos to be accessed to use Skype, a video calling software. By using this software people can have the benefit of staying connected to their loved ones irrespective of / regardless of their location and distance. However, sometimes people might experience the breach of their confidential information by some agencies. Providing companies access to our personal data can sometimes lead to the infringement of our privacy and security.
Some applications take advantage of the process of accessing information just to gather and exploit it for malicious purposes. For instance, in 2014, Unibic calling application was highly criticized for selling the confidential data of various people to an advertising company in return for a huge amount of money. Therefore, the threat of potential misuse of personal information eclipses the advantages of having free access to an application.
In conclusion, while it is true that people can use the software for numerous important purposes in exchange for their personal information, establishments can misuse the provided data. So, I believe that benefits do not outweigh the drawbacks.

339,"Some people think that to reduce traffic and pollution, the government should increase tax on petrol. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","It is thought by some people that the amount of traffic and pollution can be decreased by having the government impose higher tax on petrol. However, I believe that the advantages of using this approach are meager compared to the disadvantages. The long term goal of tackling traffic and pollution can be achieved only by reducing the need to use private transport.
A quick solution to limit the problem of traffic and pollution is believed to be a rise in tax on petrol.  This method creates a financial burden on the users of vehicles forcing them to reduce the usage of petrol. Consequently, it results in a significant drop in the traffic on roads thereby lowering the pollution levels. However, this method has a number of repercussions and it cannot be used for a longer duration.
An increase in the tax on petrol has numerous drawbacks even though it is a quick way to lower the pollution. Initially, people may prefer to reduce the use of vehicles but later on, they adjust their finances to accommodate the rise in tax. The end result will be the same amount of traffic along with a financial burden on citizens. Another disadvantage would be an unhealthy relationship between the government and citizens. Additionally, the standard of living is also affected as people have to compromise on other commodities to save money for fuel.
On the flip side, there are better ways to reduce traffic and pollution. One of them is to create awareness. The other is to improve the reliability of public transport. If people can take buses and trains and still reach their office on time, they are less likely to drive their own vehicles to work.
To conclude, the disadvantages related to a rise in the tax on petrol outweigh the advantages. Instead of forcibly trying to curb the traffic, the government can use alternatives like creating awareness among the people about the ill-effects of pollution. Secondly, people can be provided other means of transport by enhancing the frequency and reliability of public transport. Lastly, the government can provide incentives for reducing the usage of vehicles.

340,"In many countries, prison is the most common solution for crimes. However, many think that better education is the most effective way to prevent people from committing further crime. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In many nations around the world, criminals are sentenced to imprisonment for a specific period of time according to the gravity of their crime. Even so, many people believe that repeated crimes can be prevented by providing proper education to the lawbreakers and it is the most effective solution. I completely disagree with this statement as I believe that law illiteracy is not the reason for most of the crimes. The reasons for my view will be stated in this essay before arriving at a conclusion.
The most compelling reason for holding my view is that most criminals caught in recent times are highly educated. These people already have immense knowledge about the seriousness of the offence and the punishment associated with it. However, they continue to be involved in such punishable criminal offences and get caught by the law enforcement agencies. For instance, a police statement revealed that a recent bank robbery in Kerala, India was carried out by a group of engineers who were aware of the consequences of the crime and its impact on the society.
Another reason for my position is that some crimes are intolerable by the law. Those who commit serious crimes which become a threat to the society deserve imprisonment. Additionally, some extreme criminals who are involved in terrorism or premeditated murders must get capital punishment because they are a threat to the nation. Furthermore, almost every educational system in the world has a curriculum that teaches the basic values needed to be a good citizen. Thus, giving education after committing crimes does not really change the mentality of offenders and they continue to do illegal acts since they are conscious of what they are committing
In conclusion, I totally disagree with the opinion that educating criminals is the right solution to deter them from committing further crimes. This is because offenders already have the understanding of the after effects of breaking a law, which they gained through their basic education. Additionally, serious criminals need to be eliminated or isolated from the society to ensure that everyone has a safe place to live in a country.",8,in-many-countries-prison-is-the-most-common-solution-for-crimes-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
341,"It is generally accepted that exercise is good for children and teenagers. Therefore, physical education and sport should be compulsory for all students in all schools. What do you think?","Exercise is the key to a healthy lifestyle. Working out is believed to be the most effective way to keep growing children and youngsters healthy. Some people, therefore, propose that physical training and playing outdoor games such as cricket, football, basketball and etc. should be made a compulsory part of the school curriculum. I completely agree with this idea that sport and games should be mandatory in educational institutions.
To begin with, sports help inculcate teamwork among pupils. By participating in different physical activities students will not only have fun but also learn a great deal about coordinating amongst team members. To illustrate, in a game of football, team members cannot play their own game; rather each one should play as a team to win the game. Therefore it is vital for students to participate in such games to have a better understanding of team dynamics.
Furthermore, physical activities such as going to the gym and yoga classes can help adolescents get rid of their sedentary lifestyle. Going out and playing in the open will improve their health whereas staying indoors all the time can make them lethargic. According to a recent study conducted by Cambridge University students who play outdoors enjoy better physical and mental health than those who are glued to their television sets and videogames. Thus it is imperative for youngsters to go out and play to improve their overall health.
To recapitulate, this essay has discussed how physical activities can inculcate a healthy lifestyle in children and the youth. Therefore, I strongly recommend that outdoor activities be made compulsory in educational institutions.",8,it-is-generally-accepted-that-exercise-is-good-for-children-and-teenagers-band-8-ielts-essay-sample-2
342,Some people claim that there are more disadvantages to the car than advantages? Do you agree or disagree? Discuss advantages and disadvantages of having a car?,"Many people argue that disadvantages of having a car outweigh its advantages. I completely agree with this view / argument, as despite offering comfort and being helpful in life threatening situations, a car needs heavy maintenance and causes environmental pollution.
On the one hand, it is true that owing a car means you can have an enjoyable journey. A person can have a spacious seat to sit on, listen to music and enjoy privacy in an air-conditioned ambience and thus make their ride comfortable, unlike on the public transport where people do not even have enough room to stand due to overcrowding, especially during peak hours. Moreover, personal vehicles are always beneficial during emergencies. To illustrate, if a family member is sick and needs medical help during odd hours, when finding cabs, trains or buses is extremely difficult, having a car is indeed a boon.
On the other hand, it is an irrefutable fact that four wheelers are not pocket friendly. Fuel and maintenance are additional expenses associated with car ownership. People from the middle socioeconomic background often get into financial instability due to this add on expenditure. Furthermore, automobiles need fuel to run, which on burning causes release of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases that are harmful to the environment. These fumes not only cause global warming but also worsen air pollution. If people limit the use of personal cars and start using public vehicles, this problem of rise in global temperature will be mitigated to some extent.
In conclusion, although cars provide comfort and can be quite beneficial in emergency situations, their maintenance costs and perilous impact on the planet cannot be ignored. Hence, in my opinion, there are more disadvantages than advantages to cars.",8,some-people-claim-that-there-are-more-disadvantages-to-the-car-than-advantages-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
343,"Parents, usually mothers, give up the work, choose to stay home and look after the family. Some people think the government should give them a salary. Do you agree or disagree? Give the reasons from your knowledge and experience.","Women often leave their career behind for bringing up / raising their children and to take care of the elder members of the family. Some people argue that the government should financially assist them to make the society equal. I disagree with this statement since it will adversely impact the national budget and influence working women in a negative way.
Providing some sort of monetary assistance to women who have given up their job will put a tremendous load on the country’s financial resources. Countries such as India and Pakistan are already struggling with basic problems such as poverty and food scarcity. Hence, the government’s priority should be eradicating such issues rather than providing unemployment allowance to young mothers.
Moreover, if the government decides to give a monthly salary to women who quit their job for taking care of their family, it will create resentment among other women who work a job. If they can earn a salary without going to office, then all of them will definitely resign from their jobs to be stay-at-home mother. Eventually, the government will end up paying all women for staying home. Thus, obviously, providing wages to mothers who stay at home is not good for a nation’s economy.
To conclude, assisting women who left their jobs to take care of their families with salaries is not a good approach. I believe that the government should provide them other forms of assistance such as free medical assistance and insurance. It should also enact policies that allow young mothers to work from their home and earn a salary.",8,parents-usually-mothers-give-up-work-to-look-after-family-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
344,It is becoming increasingly popular to have a year off between finishing school and going to university. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?,"There is no doubt that the trend of taking a year break after the completion of school and before starting the college courses has become more popular. In this write up, I will highlight the benefits and drawbacks of this new development / approach.
To start with the positives, a significant advantage is that students can explore the possibilities and get prepared for the future assignments. For instance, during this time children can learn new languagues, or they can enrol in a course which can provide them the extra credits. As a result, the candidates will have an edge over their competition, and get admitted to the desired college. Moreover, teenagers nowadays are interested in travelling to other nations prior to commencing another phase of their life. This is because some of them might be interested in doing some voluntary work and others might find it refreshing to gain knowledge about the diverse cultures.
However, taking an year off can have some disadvantages too, the most obvious one of which is the loss of track due to the long gap. For example, some students may fall into the trap of bad influence and they might start using drugs, alcohols ,and other harmful substances. This will definitely sabotage their future. Furthermore, youngsters may be diverted from their path, if they start earning their livelihood. Such an environment is likely to curtail their interest in further education. Children are the future of the nation, and such mishaps can affect the entire nation’s progress.
In conclusion, although having a year  gap can broaden the horizons of the students by providing them a better vision of the society and various cultures, it can also deviate them from the right path and their jeopardize their future.

345,"Today more and more tourists are visiting places where conditions are difficult, such as the Sahara desert or the Antarctic? What are the benefits and disadvantages for tourists who visit such places?","Unconventional tourism or visiting inaccessible places has lately become quite an attraction for travelers across the globe. The number of tourists visiting places such as Mount Everest, Antarctica and Sahara desert has sky rocketed over the past few years. In the next set of paragraphs, I will outline both the advantages and drawbacks of this trend.
First of all, there is an increased awareness of these unconventional locations due to the rise of social media. This is an advantage because more and more people are being made aware of how beautiful our planet is. Also, owing to their inhospitable conditions, these kinds of places come across as challenges that need to be conquered. Hence the gritty and adventurous folks get excited about taming them. As more and more people explore these places, the society at large will be able to appreciate the previously unseen beauty that was hiding from plain sight.
However, there is a disadvantage as well. Human settlements in these remote and beautiful places mean that a pile of garbage will be left behind by tourists. For instance, consider the case of Mount Everest. In the 20th century scaling Mount Everest was a rarity. Now, with increased use of technology more and more people are able to scale it and experience the best that nature has to offer. However, these hikers camping on the Everest have left behind huge piles of waste on the world’s largest peak. This has become such a big problem that Nepal’s tourism authority has been forced to jump into action to clean the plastic and other forms of waste.
In conclusion, visiting remote places comes with both advantages and disadvantages. More and more remote parts of the world are documented for all of us to see and experience the diversity that planet earth has to offer. However, by trying to tame these places we are destroying the very natural beauty that these places have to offer.",8,today-more-and-more-tourists-are-visiting-places-where-conditions-are-difficult-band-8-ielts-essay-sample-2
346,"In some countries, it is becoming increasingly common for people to follow a vegetarian diet. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","In some nations, vegetarianism is gaining popularity and I think it is a positive development. A vegetarian diet may be deficient in certain nutrients; however, in my opinion, the advantages of vegetarianism far outweigh the disadvantages.
Vegetarians are less likely to develop certain life threatening diseases like obesity, cancer or heart trouble because plant based foods are low in fat and rich in fibre which safeguard our body from various lifestyle diseases. For example, a report by WHO organisation reveals that people who eat animal based diet such as red meat are more likely to suffer from cardiovascular ailments because of the high fat content present in the meat. Therefore, I believe that consuming a plant based diet is a better way to live a healthy life. Another advantage of vegetarianism is that it allows us to sustain ourselves without harming other forms of life.
On the flip side, people who consume only plant based foods can face the deficiency of certain vitamins, minerals and proteins and this might lead to malnutrition. For example, animal sources such as meat, fish and eggs are rich in proteins and aid the development of body. While protein is also present in vegetarian foods, the quantity is low. According to a survey protein deficiency is uncommon among people who follow a non-vegetarian diet whereas these deficiencies are common among Indians because most of them are vegetarians. However, the inadequacy of these vital nutrients and minerals can be addressed by taking supplements of these in the form of tablets.
In conclusion, while it is true that a vegetarian diet is deficient in certain nutrients, it provides ample protection from many deadly diseases. Also, the nutritional deficiencies can be solved by taking supplements; hence, in my opinion, the advantages of following a vegetarian diet far outweigh the disadvantages.",8,in-some-countries-it-is-becoming-increasingly-common-for-people-to-follow-a-vegetarian-diet-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
347,Some people think that economic development is the only way to end poverty while others believe that it is causing damage to the environment and so it should be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The impact of economic development on the society is always debated nowadays. While some people believe that it is harming the environment, there are also people who believe that it is helping the developing countries to eradicate poverty. In my opinion, the only way to stop poverty is to develop the economy by creating jobs and growing various sectors.
Firstly, in order to end poverty, the governments of those third world nations need to create more jobs by building plants to produce goods for exports. These factories will create demand for labour, and eventually these workers will have a source of income. Therefore, they can build up their wealth and improve their lifestyles. Furthermore, countries that have limited natural resources need to grow their economy in different sectors to stay away from poverty. Singapore is a classic example. They spent many years to develop their financial sectors in order to stay competitive, and now they have become one of the richest nations in Asia.
However, it is undeniable that building up the economy of a country will affect the environment. Some people would argue that this will accelerate the global warming because development often involves deforestation. Trees are cut down to build houses. As a result, carbon dioxide will increase significantly and this will potentially worsen the global warming issue. However, halting economic development is not the solution. Rather we should find ways to grow the economy without harming the environment. For example, new age technologies like solar energy and electric cars do not cause much harm to the environment. Investing in such technologies is the solution we need today.
In conclusion, although some environmental damage will inevitably occur, people can enjoy better life when jobs are created. If the country says no to economic development for the sake of environment, they will not be able to survive for long. Therefore, on balance, I believe that economic advancement is the only way for the country to grow and prosper and as such it should not be halted.",8,some-people-think-that-economic-development-is-the-only-way-to-end-poverty-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
348,"Some people believe that money is the most important factor for achieving happiness. However, others believe that happiness has nothing to do with money. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is often debated whether money can bring happiness in your life. It is not always necessary that a rich person is happy: you can buy a lot of things with money but happiness is something which cannot be bought. One can feel happiness while sipping a cup of tea sitting in their balcony or reading a favourite book; therefore, in my opinion, money is not directly related to happiness.
A rich person who has money can buy all the materialistic things and may seem to be happy but it does not imply that a poor person is not happy. A person who is always busy earning money and travelling for business hardly gets time to spend with his family; as a result neither he nor his family is happy. On the contrary / By contrast, a poor farmer is happy with less money because he spends time and enjoys meals with his children.
In addition, there are many people suffering from health issues due to loneliness, depression because they have no one to share their thoughts and feelings with. Some of them are so busy working that they hardly get time to talk to their parents or close friends. On the flip side, a person who lives with their parents and has friends is able to cope up in bad time quickly. It is very important for every one of us to interact with someone whom we love because it gives us internal happiness and satisfaction that there is someone who cares for us. While I admit money is important it has no meaning in some aspects of life.
Money is required to fulfil our basic needs like shelter, food, clothing, etc. but it is not the utmost factor which can constitute happiness. Parents, family, friends are more important in a person’s life to give internal happiness and they cannot be bought with money.",8,some-people-believe-that-money-is-the-most-important-factor-for-achieving-happiness-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
349,"Art is considered an essential part of all cultures throughout the world. However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology and business. Why do you think that is? What could be done to encourage more people to take interest in the arts?","Art is a crucial part of cultural heritage. Therefore, across the globe art forms an important element of cultures. However, nowadays, not many people are interested in arts. Actually, the majority of people lean towards subjects like science, technology and business. The main reason behind this is the money earned after learning these subjects as they offer better job prospects. However, this situation can be tackled if authorities take a few measures in association with the general public.
People are losing interest in arts as they do not consider it as a practical subject. In other words, learning art may not help them secure a good job in a multinational company. Many artists struggle to earn their livelihood as compared to those employed in sectors of business and technology. Focusing on subjects other than art is considered as a gateway to success. To illustrate, a recent survey conducted by the Times Magazine has showed that many science graduates get better job offers than art graduates.
However, art is the backbone of our culture. Lack of interest in art will eventually lead to the death of rich cultural heritages across the world. The government can help to revive interest of young generations in art. The authorities should allocate budget for developing art field by constructing art schools and maintaining art galleries. Organising cultural events will generate jobs for many and will attract many tourists. Increase in the number of tourists will help generate more revenue. The better financial prospects will act as a boost for people to pursue art as a passion and a career option.
In conclusion, subjects such as science, technology and business are lucrative in terms of job prospects, but art too can be a source of livelihood.

350,More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people say that increasing the price of fattening foods will solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In many countries around the world, a large number of people are getting obese. It is argued by some people that raising the price of high-fat food will reduce its consumption and thereby people’s overweight issue will be addressed. I disagree with the opinion because some people are addicted to fast food which contains high amount of fat and simply increasing the price will not cut down their fat intake. There are some other additional reasons for my view which will be stated in this essay.
The most compelling reason for holding my view is that many youngsters are not ready to avoid ready-made food and its unique taste just because of a rise in price. Therefore, they continue to consume high-fat food items and ignore their health problems. For instance, McDonald’s outlets around the world deliver food which contains enormous amount of saturated fat. However, a study found that most people prefer McDonald food over healthy alternatives because of its distinctive taste. Thus, people are ready to buy those foods even for a higher price.
Secondly, high-fat foods are not the only reason for obesity among people. Nowadays, a large number of people are leading a sedentary lifestyle which is considered as one of the major reasons for obesity. Therefore, physical exercise plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy body. Due to this reason, increasing the price of fatty foods does not solely address the overweight problem.
In conclusion, I totally disagree with the opinion that increasing the price of fattening food is the ideal solution to control overweight of people. People are ready to pay higher price for foods which are easily available and having pleasant taste even if the fat content is higher. In addition, I believe that encouraging / promoting physical exercise is more crucial for maintaining body weight than regulating fatty food.",8,more-and-more-people-are-becoming-seriously-overweight-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
351,In many western countries there are an increasing number of couples choosing to have no children. What are the advantages and disadvantages to couples having no children?,"It is true that there has been a rise in the number of married couples who do not want to bring a child into this world. This is particularly true in the western world. The main advantage of this trend is that it allows a couple to live a carefree life with fewer responsibilities and the main drawback is they will feel lonely when they get old.
Having no children after marriage means fewer responsibilities for a couple. They can enjoy their life free from any extra financial stresses because they do not need to handle the expenditures of raising a child. Therefore, they do not need to work for extra hours to earn more money and they can spend their life fulfilling their dreams and accomplishing their aspirations. For example, a study by The Times shows that 52% of married couples having with no children tend to live a more enjoyable and happier life than those who have children since they remain anxious about their children’s future.
On the other hand, the main disadvantage of this phenomenon is that when the couple gets old and infirm they might miss the mental and emotional support which is extremely important for the elderly people. This will make them feel isolated and depressed and they might end up feeling miserable in the twilight years of their life. This situation could worsen if either the husband or the wife dies untimely.
In conclusion, although the decision to have no children after marriage is beneficial for people who do not want to be burdened with the responsibilities associated with parenthood, childless couples are more likely to experience loneliness and the lack of a good support system as they age.",8,in-many-western-countries-there-are-an-increasing-number-of-couples-choosing-to-have-no-children-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
352,Music should not be taught in schools. Instead other subjects such as computer and science should be taught. Do you agree or disagree with the statement?,"It is considered by many that subjects such as computer and science should be preferred to subjects such as music. Although computer and science are crucial subjects, in my opinion, they cannot replace music as it has its own importance.
Firstly, music comes under the category of art and therefore, it cannot be compared with science. In other words, often music represents the culture and custom of a community which cannot be represented by other means. If music is replaced in schools with other subjects, newer generation will never be able to fully understand and connect with their community’s culture. For example, often a lot of traditional stories are told in the form of folk songs because the music in the folk songs helps the children to understand the situation and emotions of the story.
Another point to consider before preferring subjects like computers to music is that every child has different interests. While some students may be interested in science, there will be many who are interested in music. Moreover, students will get to know about the music at a young age which will increase career options available to them. For instance, a lot of famous musicians discovered music as a subject in their school. Ultimately, they found value in music and chose it as their career path.
In conclusion, music is as important as subjects like computer and science because it has cultural significance and helps people to understand emotions. While other subjects have good career opportunities, music also offers a career with money and fame. Hence, I think it will be unwise to replace music with other subjects.",8,music-should-not-be-taught-in-schools-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
353,Museums and historical sites are mainly visited by tourists but not local people. Why is this the case? What can be done to attract local people to visit these places?,"Most of the historical places such as forts, monuments and museums are a point of attraction for the tourists. It is a common observation that natives / native people do not visit these places. One major reason for this is that visiting such places repeatedly is monotonous.
Plus, the local public do not wish to spend money on entry tickets to visit the same place again and again. However, it is possible to attract local residents to these sites by taking certain measures. This essay will discuss the mentioned causes and the solutions to attract locals to these places.
One important reason for the local public to not visit the local historical places is that they have nothing new to offer. Many prefer to visit multiplexes and amusement parks which are loaded with new attractions. Hence, museums and art galleries which have the same exhibits on display cannot pull the local crowd. Another important reason is the entry fees. Entry fees at museums and historical places can hinder a local tourist from visiting them. No one is interested in paying for entry to see the same artefacts on display again and again. For example, a fort built by King Bhosle at Nagpur has very few local visitors owing to the hefty entry fees.
However, by taking few actions this issue can be taken care of. Adding new attractions to museums and forts can gain the attention of native visitors. Historical places will be able to pull more local crowd if they have additional activities to offer. For example, forts in Rajasthan organise cultural programmes by folk artists who rotate on weekly basis. Such rotation amongst different folk artists for performances can keep a place lively and enjoyable. In addition, waving off the entry fee for the local residents can boost the number of local visitors. To illustrate, the Raman Science Centre at Nagpur is gathering a considerable number of native visitors since it waived off the entry fee for the locals.
In conclusion, the monotony of local historical places can be changed by reviving them with new attractions. Also, entry fee waiver is an important step to push native people to visit local places frequently.",8,local-people-do-not-visit-museums-and-historical-places-band-8-ielts-essay-sample-2
354,"Many countries aim to improve their living standard by economic development, but some important social values are lost as a result. Do you think the advantages of economic development outweigh the disadvantages?","Many leaders around the world believe that improving a country’s economy will bring developments in many other aspects of a country. However, some people point out that focusing too much on financial prosperity has caused traditional values to be forgotten. Although I agree with their view to some extent, I believe that the benefits brought by a good economy far outweigh its drawbacks.
Admittedly, there are a few downsides to placing too much importance on economic growth. Striving for the financial gain can cause citizens to become money oriented and more materialistic. People overindulge in luxuries and eventually, traditional societal values such as value of moderation rather than excess are lost. Happiness will be defined by one’s material possessions and children will think that everything can be bought with money. Moreover, parents are so busy working for money that they overlook the importance of family and the value of a close knit family is often forgotten as a consequence.
On the other hand, a financially stable country has many advantages over a poor nation. A healthy economy means better job opportunities, high employment rates and higher income for the citizens. An economically strong government can invest in the country’s infrastructures such as schools, hospitals and transport networks resulting in more educated and healthier citizens who enjoy higher living standards. This can lead to a significant reduction in many social and health problems such as illiteracy, crimes and poverty related diseases that are faced by countries with financial limitations. Moreover, it is generally true that the happiest countries in the world are the ones that are doing financially well such as Norway and Denmark.
In conclusion, I believe that every country needs to work towards financial development as it brings many advantages for its nationals. However, individuals ought to work together to attain the financial goals whilst preserving the important social values.",8,many-countries-aim-to-improve-their-living-standard-by-economic-development-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
355,"Doctors recommend that older people should get regular exercise. However, many older people do not take enough exercise. What could be the reasons for this? What can be done to encourage them to take exercise?","Exercise is the key to health as per eminent doctors. Despite this, older generations shun from exercising. I believe the reason behind this is the fear of injury and by alleviating that they can be motivated to perform exercise.
Older people abstain from doing exercise due to fear of injury. It is a well-known fact that during old age, the human body is weaker. If the body sustains any injury, recovery could take months or years. This is the main reason that deters seniors from getting physically active. To cite an example from my personal experience, my grandmother’s ankle got twisted during evening walk; therefore, she had to use wheelchair for 2 months and took another one month in order to walk properly. She is now afraid of doing any exercise.
Since exercise provides invaluable health benefits, it is important for the elderly to overcome this fear of injury. The family can play a crucial role in helping them achieve this. To start with, instead of stimulating them to do strenuous activity, they should be taught about light forms of exercise, which requires slow movement of body Yoga. Another option is to encourage seniors to use protective gears like helmet and knee-cap while exercising. They can also perform household chores that do not require much effort. For example, tending to the garden and sweeping the floors are activities that help with muscle movement and promote the health of joints.
In conclusion, seniors are reluctant to exercise because of the fear of sustaining injuries. However, the chances of injuries can be avoided to a great extent by wearing appropriate exercise gear.",8,doctors-recommend-that-older-people-should-get-regular-exercise-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
356,"“Prevention is better than cure”, Researching and treating diseases is too costly so it would be better to invest in preventive measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is often said that taking precautionary measures in dealing with diseases is a better approach than getting treatment after contracting one. Although this adage may be true, not all diseases can be prevented and therefore require treatment in order to be cured. This essay disagrees with this statement and will discuss why sometimes diseases cannot be prevented and hence research is necessary to cure them.
There are a number of diseases that cannot be prevented through precaution such as, measles, polio, chicken pox etc. Moreover, there are diseases which are genetically linked and people who have defective genes will contract these illnesses at some point of time. Therefore, in such cases one has to visit a hospital and get necessary treatment in order to get cured. For instance, Type 1 diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and certain types of cancers are hereditary and they can only be treated through medication and therapy.
Without research, treatment for non preventable diseases will not be possible. In addition to that, there will always be new disease outbreaks due to the evolution of bacteria and viruses. Recently, many people suffered from Ebola fever that led to the death of patients in severe cases. The causative virus also affects the development of fetus in pregnant women. Therefore, we need to actively conduct research and arm ourselves to tackle unknown as well as non preventable diseases.
To conclude, prevention should be practiced as a precaution to avoid getting sick, but this will not help us avoid certain illnesses which require medical intervention. Hence, research is absolutely required to develop vaccines, medicines and medical procedures to deal with genetically linked diseases and non preventable diseases.",8,researching-and-treating-diseases-is-too-costly-so-it-would-be-better-to-invest-in-preventive-measures-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
357,With the rise in e-books comes the decline in paper books. Some people see this as a good step forward while others do not. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?,"Reading books on electronic devices such as tablets and smart phones is becoming increasingly popular. On the one hand, some feel that this change is a positive one, but on the other hand, people see this as a negative development. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages associated with this trend.
The biggest advantage of eBooks is that they can be stored and carried around easily/conveniently. Thousands of e-books can be stored on electronic devices such as tablets and smartphones which are no bigger than the size of your palm and therefore, people can carry their entire library with them wherever they go. A survey by the New York Times reported that more than 70 percent of the University students prefer e-books as they can now carry a single device containing an array of digital books in their pockets instead of a huge backpack filled with paper / hardcover books.
On the flip side, people feel that the over-reliance on electronic devices for reading puts a strain on the reader’s eyes. This is because tablets and smartphones emit blue light from their screens which causes stress and irritation to the eyes upon prolonged exposure. Ophthalmologists have found that more than half of the patients who visit them face issues with their eyesight primarily due to the excessive usage of electronic devices for reading purpose. Therefore, people need to take precaution while relying on reading books on their gadgets. Also, software glitches or a weak battery can make these devices useless and reading impossible. Since this can happen at the most inopportune times, it is not safe to rely on eBooks alone.
To conclude, the major benefit of e-books is the convenience of carrying a vast number of files on a single device that people can access anywhere. Despite the advantages of this trend, it has the drawback of affecting the reader’s eyesight. Also, any problem with the eBook reader can make the books inaccessible.",8,with-the-rise-in-ebooks-comes-the-decline-in-paper-books-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
358,"Some people believe that to be a good teacher, you need to acquire training in teaching, while others believe that teaching capabilities can be developed with experience. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is a contentious issue whether or not teacher training is essential for teachers. In my opinion, teachers have a major role to play and therefore they should be trained properly.
Like every other skill, teaching skills can also be achieved through practice. Experienced teachers know how to capture the attention of their class by making their lessons interesting. They know how to control a class of 30 or 40 students coming from diverse backgrounds. Hence, the argument that teachers do not require any special training certainly holds some water.
However, it takes years to acquire experience. Actually, someone who just starts their career in teaching has no experience to rely on. And because of this lack of experience they may struggle in the initial years. This could hurt their morale and they may even start detesting their career. Since teachers are the ones who mould the future of our young generation, it is important for them to be qualified for their job from day one. They cannot wait for 10 or 15 years to acquire those invaluable teaching skills. Training courses impart those skills reasonably well. When aspiring teachers attend a training course, they get to know what they can expect from their job. This knowledge makes them better equipped to deal with the challenges of their profession.
In conclusion, although years of working as a teacher can help teachers develop essential teaching skills, any kind of deficiency can create problems. Hence, I believe that proper training is essential to become a good mentor.",8,some-people-believe-that-to-be-a-good-teacher-you-need-to-acquire-training-in-teaching-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
359,More and more newspapers and news channels are using photographs to support their news articles and stories. Some people think photographs are not a reliable source of news while others consider photographs to be irrefutable. Discuss both sides and give your opinion,"It is true that an increasing number of media houses use photographs to validate their news stories. While some people think photographs are not a vital source of information others opine that their role in disseminating news is indispensable. In my opinion using photographs in the news columns plays a very important role in stimulating interest among the readers and aids in easy understanding.
On the one hand, some people think that photographs are not a valid source of news for the simple reason that they can be doctored. In this age of Photoshop and multimedia, there is no way we can be assured of the authenticity of images that we come across in newspapers and on the internet. In fact, there have been many instances when photos were morphed or edited to taint the reputation of some well-known people. A morphed image looks original but that is not the case. Countless celebrities and politicians have paid the price of fame by having their morphed images in compromising or unflattering positions published in glossies. Since photos look truer than words, they do considerable harm and it is not always possible for a tainted person to regain their reputation. Hence, the argument that photos are not a valid source of information certainly holds some water.
On the other hand, photos make the story livelier. They arouse the interest of the reader and make them want to read the whole story. Also, we can never dismiss the fact that photos capture the moments as they are and are an accurate representation of the event or the happening. Of course, they can be manipulated but in the absence of any manipulation, they are the ultimate truth. One has to admit that the vast majority of photos published in newspapers are genuine and provide a clear picture of the news story. In addition, readers are able to understand the news easily when the news stories are supported by photos.
To conclude while it is true that people have different views I believe photographs in news stories are indispensable as they not only kindle the interest among the readers but also facilitate easy understanding of the news story.",8,more-and-more-newspapers-and-news-channels-are-using-photographs-to-support-their-news-articles-and-stories-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
360,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real need of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, people are living in a world flooded / bombarded with various advertisements. Some believe that this kind of propaganda affects customers’ decision and provides an excuse to buy massive amounts of unnecessary goods. As far as I am concerned, I partly agree with this view.
On the one hand, there are plenty of advertisements that proclaim / highlight their product’s advantages only to hook consumers. These ads mislead clients and encourage / compel them to spend a large sum of money on buying these things. Furthermore, many industries, especially some cosmetics companies make false claims in their adverts with the objective of luring customers into buying their products. The propaganda such as “20 lipsticks that a girl must have” has already brainwashed many young and impulsive females to pursue the stuff that they cannot afford or they do not really need.
On the other hand, this high sales phenomenon is not only caused by advertising but also influenced by the development of economy. The evolution of globalization and advanced technology plays an essential role in increasing the purchases as well. Also, thanks to the growing competition in the market, companies are reducing their prices and as a result even high value products have become affordable to consumers. It is not hard for many middle class people to possess the luxury goods, and this increases the volume of sales in many industries.
In conclusion, the advertisement does have a deep impact on the purchase decision. However, we could not consider it as the only reason stimulating the sales.",8,today-the-high-sale-of-consumer-goods-reflect-the-power-of-advertising-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
361,Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?,"Nowadays, due to the availability of similar goods all over the world, most nations are looking alike. In my opinion, it is an adverse development as it leads to a rise in carbon emission and the destruction of various cultures.
The most important reason why I believe the availability of the same products everywhere is a negative development is the increase in export. Countries all over the world are selling surplus goods to other countries these days. As a result of this, there is a tremendous increase in the carbon footprint.  For example, flights are the most appropriate and fastest mode for transporting a product to a foreign country. Therefore, there is no doubt that an exotic Kiwi fruit exported from Australia to India leaves a huge amount of harmful gases in the environment.
Another reason to disapprove of this trend is the loss of cultural diversity. In recent times, it is quite possible to transport clothes from one country to another country at a nominal cost. Due to this trend, the popularity of traditional clothes is decreasing. Traditional clothes are linked to the culture of a country. With easy access to exported clothes, people are avoiding conventional clothing of their home countries. Consequently, such development influences our cultural aspects negatively. There is no denying the fact that this trend may even force a culture to disappear permanently.
In conclusion, since the easy accessibility of the same goods all over the world has crippling impacts on the atmosphere and the local culture, it is certainly an adverse development. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use locally produced goods and food items as much as possible.",8,countries-are-becoming-more-and-more-similar-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
362,"Some people feel that paparazzi should not follow celebrities and invade their privacy by taking pictures of them everywhere, while others believe this is just the price of fame. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There is a growing consensus among many people that individual photographers should not follow famous personalities and interfere in their personal life by capturing their private photographs while others opine that this is the price to pay for being famous. This essay discusses both sides of the argument before arriving at a conclusion.
Every individual on this planet desires to have a balance between professional and personal life. Celebrities are often bothered by photographers who capture every moment of their life. This type of continuous follow up can lead to physical and mental stress. Moreover, the family members of these celebrities always complain that they do not get enough time because of the media, and the authorities should have appropriate law to tackle this situation. For instance, in a recent interview on Star News, family members of a famous star mentioned that they go through a lot of stress because of these individual photographers who invade their private space.
However, famous people are aware that this intrusion into their lives is a small price to pay for the attention and adulation they receive. As their fans follow them everywhere, they are interested in every minute detail of their idols. Making the decision to become an actor is voluntary and they understand all the consequence they would face if they are famous.
In conclusion, I believe that famous personalities should not be disturbed when they are spending some quality time with family members and close ones. However, while it is true that media should respect the privacy of everyone including celebrities, famous people also need to realise that encroachment on privacy is the price to pay for being popular. Those who really value their privacy can always choose not to be a celebrity.

363,"Today more and more tourists are visiting places where the conditions are difficult, such as the Sahara desert or The Antarctic. What are the benefits and disadvantages for tourists who visit such places?","Nowadays, the trend of visiting a place where the conditions are harsh has peaked. People often prefer going to places like the Sahara desert or the Antarctic. This essay discusses various advantages and downsides of travelling to these places.
There are two main benefits to spending a holiday at a place where conditions are tough. Firstly, it is often claimed that many people enjoy adventurous trips, and such places are the perfect choice for them. Visiting these places gives travellers the experience of a lifetime, which makes the pain taken to travel to these places worthwhile. Secondly, places with harsh conditions are generally cut off from the rest of the world. As a result of this, we hardly know anything about their culture and lifestyle. Travelling to these places enables people to mingle with natives and learn about their culture.
On the other hand, there are apparent drawbacks to visiting a location with extreme conditions. To begin with, these places can pose a risk to the health of a traveller. It is quite possible for people who visit such destinations to fall ill due to the unbearably hot or cold weather, which, in turn, can spoil their entire vacation. Furthermore, it is often argued that these trips are usually not pocket-friendly as a lot of extra arrangements need to be made for these excursions. For instance, if someone plans to explore an extremely cold place, he will have to spend a huge amount of money for buying appropriate winter clothing.
In conclusion, although travelling to difficult places is an opportunity to gain invaluable experience, such trips are not economical and they may even impact one’s health adversely.",8,today-more-and-more-tourists-are-visiting-places-where-conditions-are-difficult-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
364,Restricting air travel is the only way to prevent air pollution. Do you agree?,"Some people believe that the only method to reduce the air pollution is to limit the number of flights. I do not agree with this viewpoint. In my opinion limiting the number of flights may reduce the air pollution to some extent; however, other measures such as regulating the use of various private modes of transportation such as motorized vehicles and creating awareness about the appalling affects of air pollution can be more fruitful.
To begin with, it is undeniable that airplanes cause air pollution as they produce a huge amount of carbon dioxide which causes a lot of pollution in the atmosphere and leads to global warming. For example, it is estimated by Green Peace that up to 13,000 tonnes of CO2 is released into the atmosphere every year by planes, thus increasing the carbon footprint in the air. Although it is possible to control this pollution by reducing the frequency of flights, it will not fully solve the problem, because the majority of pollutants in the air do not come from aircrafts and as such it cannot be considered the number one cause of air contamination.
By contrast, the major cause of air pollution is the emission of poisonous gases by motor vehicles and factories. There are millions of cars on the roads and the vast majority of them run on fossil fuels which cause the emission of dangerous gases. Factories also release obnoxious gases into the atmosphere and reduce air quality. Therefore, limiting the use of such polluting means of transport can be a better solution to mitigate the effect of air pollution. Also factories should be moved from cities to sparsely populated areas. Additionally, the state should educate people about the dangers of polluting the air that we breathe in and encourage them to use non-polluting modes such as bicycles and walking for short distances.
In conclusion, although restricting airways can lessen the air pollution, it is not the perfect solution. Pollution is caused by a number of factors and aircrafts just one of them. Hence, restricting air travel is not the right solution to air pollution.",8,restricting-air-travel-is-the-only-way-to-prevent-air-pollution-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
365,The recent popularity of online shopping will result in the end of high street shops. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"Some people argue that online shopping is getting more and more popular nowadays and the brick and mortar shops are no longer relevant. However, I disagree with that argument. Although high street shops now are not as popular as they were in the past, they are still needed for many reasons.
It is undeniably true that online shopping has significantly impacted the business of street shops negatively. Alibaba, for instance, has become the most popular online shopping platform in the world. The company recently hit $100 billion in revenue) and became one of the largest establishments in the world. This is because e-commerce is so convenient that everything that we need to buy is just one click away, and the item will be delivered to our door step. However, the disadvantage of buying things online is that it may get very disappointing when the products delivered do not meet our expectation. As a result, we will have to return it through courier service, and this will become very time consuming. Hence, this channel is not suitable for items that are needed urgently.
By contrast, when we buy from a highway store we can check the quality of the product in person and thus ensure that it meets our requirements. For example, some buyers prefer to touch the products before purchasing them. This is especially true when those are luxury goods as they need to ensure that the items are free of defect before paying for them. Also, when we buy from an actual store, we can take the products home immediately. But when we buy online we may have to wait days or even weeks before the product to arrive. High street shops also serve as a place to hang out with friends or family.
In conclusion, although online shopping has threatened the survival of brick and mortar stores, I believe that they will not close down because there are still many people who want to physically check the quality of the product before making the purchase. Also, online shopping is not suitable if we need the product immediately.

404,"Recently, many people know only a few of their neighbors. What is the cause of this problem? What can be done to solve this problem? Give reasons for your answer and any example from your own experience.","Nowadays, many people are less interested in maintaining any friendly relation with their neighbors. The face to face interaction and the sense of brotherhood have been diminishing since the emergence of the sophisticated life and hi-tech culture. This essay will briefly look into some of its causes and suggest some solutions.
Firstly, today’s young generations are well educated and they prefer to migrate to the metros for their livelihood because of this their neighbors are strangers to them. The majority of people do not show the interest to build a sudden relationship with strangers. Apart from this, the cultural and language difference are also a factor of concern when it comes to interaction among the neighbors. Moreover, people are so busy with their work schedule; most of them leave home early in the morning and reach late at the night so they generally do not have enough time to interact with the neighbors. Another reason is the addiction to electronic media. These days, many people spend much of their free time on social networking sites like Facebook and Instagram.
However, this is an unhealthy development and may lead to various social and psychological problems. In order to tackle this, everyone should understand that their neighbors would be more helpful than their closest relatives in case of an emergency situation at their homes. People must reduce the usage of social media which are full of virtual friends and should rather focus on building harmonious relation with their neighbors. People residing in metros should form some clubs to integrate with other people coming from the same state/region as them.
In my own experience I have witnessed that in a funeral service at an apartment in a metro city there were hardly ten to fifteen people. Most of the neighbors in that housing colony were clueless about what happened in that home.
To conclude, we should consider the fact that neighbors can be more helpful to us than our nearest relatives in certain situations and we must build good relation with them.

432,University students are increasingly studying abroad as part of their studies. Do the advantages of studying abroad outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays many students pursue their higher studies in foreign countries. The main advantage for students studying abroad is the access to better quality education and improved job prospects. Although these can be beneficial there are some disadvantages like difficulty to adapt to the local culture and linguistic challenges. In my opinion, despite these downsides, students studying abroad enjoy better career prospects and exposure to diverse cultures.
The main advantage is that the students will get global exposure and quality of education will be high and so will be the the career growth and wages. Whenever students visit foreign countries they will experience different set of new things like culture, language, and climate etc. For example, Sundar Pichai CEO of Google comes from India and he did his higher education in USA and got himself into a position that fulfilled his career ambition. I strongly support that there are lots of advantages to pursuing education abroad.
On the down side, studying abroad poses many challenges. An international student may have to deal with racism. They may also find it difficult to adapt to the alien culture and climate. For example, Indian students studying in cold countries like Canada and the UK often complain of the harsh winters they have to cope with. For example, one of my friends applied for his post-graduation degree abroad and he spent lots of money to get into that university, but unfortunately he was not able to adapt to their syllabus and climate so returned to his home country midway through the first semester. Such incidents are not rare.
In conclusion, the fact that more and more students opt to study abroad is a clear indication that the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages. Of course, there are some minor drawbacks to pursuing higher education abroad, but a student who is willing to adapt to the cultural and climatic change can reap rich benefits from studying overseas.",8,university-students-are-increasingly-studying-abroad-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
433,More and more people are suffering from health problems caused by modern life style which cannot be treated with modern medicines. Some people think that a return to traditional medicines should be encouraged. To what extent do you agree?,"Even though modern medicine has increased the life expectancy in general, the overall quality of life has taken a plunge due to health problems caused by the modern lifestyle. While some recommend a complete go back to traditional medicine, may others including me recommend a combination of traditional and modern medicines to adequately address the situation because traditional medicines were designed at a time that did not take the modern lifestyle into account.
As technology advanced and demand for goods increased, machines started performing many of the common tasks that humans used to perform because machines are more efficient in performing mundane tasks. As a result, the daily physical activity of humans has significantly decreased; for example, motor cars have eliminated the need to walk or cycle. Furthermore, as population increased the demand for food and supplies has increased with it. To meet that new demand, companies are producing genetically modified crops that yield a higher output but can cause diseases such as cancer. Although traditional medicines are very effective in treating both common and complex health conditions, they are not designed to manage issues caused by the lack of physical activity or the consumption of unhealthy foods.
Modern medicine has been making tremendous progress in managing life style problems such as obesity and cancer. However, there are a lot of known and unknown side effects to them because they have not been in the market for long. Traditional medicines on the other hand are devoid of such side effects and can treat a lot of issues that people face today. In addition, since modern medicine has assumed prominence today, traditional medicine is ignored to a great extent and does not receive enough funding. Therefore, traditional medicine is not catching up in some of the areas where modern medicine is doing wonders.
In conclusion, modern lifestyle has created medical problems that were absent in the past when humans consumed more natural produce and exercised more. As a result, traditional medicine that was created without taking the modern lifestyle into account cannot solve all the medical problems of the day even though it offers effective cures to many illnesses. Modern medicine, on the other hand, received significant research attention in the last century and has made strides in curing many diseases caused by lifestyle. Therefore, I recommend a combination of both traditional and modern medicines to create a harmonious balance.",8,more-and-more-people-are-suffering-from-health-problems-caused-by-modern-lifestyle-which-cannot-be-cured-with-modern-medicines-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
434,Living in a country where you have to speak in a foreign language can cause serious social problems as well as practical problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people migrate to foreign countries in search of better work and living environments. Living in such countries where you have to use an entirely unknown language leads to difficulty in social and practical scenarios. This essay will argue that although there are many issues arising from the language barriers, these are not so serious that they cannot be resolved.
In my opinion, although language barriers may create many issues, these are not so serious that they cannot be resolved. The practice of shifting base to a new country is common amongst all classes of people. It is obvious that they will encounter problems when it comes to conversing with the local people and may also face similar issues at work. As they do not know how to speak the local dialect, their ability to socialise and perform various day to day activities will be hampered.
For example, shopping in the vegetable market may seem a huge task. Thus living in such countries where one ought to speak the country’s native language is certainly is certainly going to be challenging at least in the first few months. There are multiple factors that one must consider prior to moving to a new land. The factors will help to cope up with the language barrier. Prior to moving to a foreign land, one must prepare oneself for what lies ahead.
For example, before migrating to Germany where the majority speaks German, one must get acquainted with the basics of the language. In this age of the internet and online forums, learning a new language is easier than ever before. Taking help of one’s own compatriots living abroad is another way to overcome this problem.",8,living-in-a-country-where-you-have-to-speak-a-foreign-language-can-cause-serious-social-and-practical-problems-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
435,Many people believe that advertising has negative effects on consumers. To what extent do you agree?,"These days, in order to reach a large number of people, companies advertise their products extensively. Some people think that these advertisements have negative effects on customers. I wholeheartedly agree with this view because adverts mostly show misleading information to create false demand and hire famous people to attract consumers. In fact, some of them are aimed at children who are too young to understand the consequences of using the advertised products.
To begin with, most of the time ads compel people to buy unnecessary products. This is because the mere aim of companies is to attract a large number of consumers and inflate their profits. In order to achieve this goal, they come up with an attractive advertisement showing fabricated information which forces people to buy things they do not even need. Another significant concern about TV commercials is that the companies hire well-known celebrities to endorse their products. This misleads people into believing that their favourite stars also use those products and hence they buy them. Additionally, some of the advertisements especially commercials promoting fast food are aimed at children.
These products are mostly made of ingredients that can have adverse effects on the health of children. Take for example, advertisement for chips. When children watch an ad of chips on TV, they force their parents to buy them chips. Eating chips, which is full of salt, oil and monosodium glutamate, can make them lazy and obese. Children, who are usually immature, do not understand the consequences of eating such unhealthy food. Thus it is evident that adverts have damaging effects on children.
To conclude, I totally agree with the view that adverts are harmful because they mislead consumers with false claims and hire celebrities to endorse their products enhance their sales. Worse still, sometimes ads target little ones who have no clue about how dangerous these items could be for them.",8,many-people-believe-that-advertising-has-negative-effects-on-consumers-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
436,"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.","For the holistic development of children, schools should have a perfect mix of academic as well as non-academic subjects. According to some people, it should be made compulsory for students to learn music, acting and creative writing. I agree with this viewpoint as learning these subjects will enhance their creative skills, and they will also get a much needed break from regular subjects.
To begin with, having extracurricular subjects such as arts, drama and creative writing in the syllabus helps students enormously. This is because when students learn these courses, it enables them to develop their creative, thinking and imaginative skills, which are beneficial for learning academic subjects. For instance, it is easier for a student with higher imagination capabilities to solve a complex mathematics problem. Additionally, some children are blessed with artistic skills so these classes will give them a platform where they can develop these abilities further and perfect them.
Another benefit of having non-academic subject in the syllabus is that it alleviates the academic pressure on children. These subjects give students a much needed break from their regular academic curriculum. Undoubtedly, competition among students has increased which can sometimes lead to stress. Therefore, it has become imperative for both schools and parents to let children spend some time doing activities which can give them a chance to relax their mind and body. For this reason, many schools have already included such subjects as part of their syllabus. If, however, students are not given this break, it will become difficult for them to stay focused, motivated and enthusiastic in other subjects because of stress.
To conclude, including arts, drama and creative writing in school curriculum will help students to reap rich benefits by strengthening their thinking power and relaxing their mind; therefore, they should be made a mandatory part of school syllabus.",8,some-people-say-that-art-subjects-such-as-music-drama-and-creative-writing-should-be-included-in-school-syllabus-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
437,University education should be free for all students. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that everyone should have free access to university education. I agree with this. I believe that students who opt to continue in the university should not be burdened with their tuition fees because not all students have the means to pay for school and, it is one of the obligations of the government to provide education to students.
Not every student who aspires to pursue higher education can afford the tuition fee. Many students who deserve to be sent to the university belong to poor families who are struggling to support their daily living. If paying for tuition is a requirement for every student to enter college then, those individuals who deserve and have the capability to be a university student will be denied of this opportunity. If a student from a developing country is not allowed to enter university due to lack of resources, he will lose his opportunity to bail his family out of poverty.
Moreover, the government should be responsible for the education of its residents. It should be the government’s priority to ensure that students who have the desire to continue and obtain a college degree will be granted a scholarship. In the long run, free university education will benefit not only the individual but also the community / country. A great example is the government scholars in the Philippines. This scholarship program enables high school students to be granted a free university education provided that they stay and serve their own country for a minimum of two years. This move of the government helped both the scholars’ family and the country at the same time.
In conclusion, provision of free education to students who have the desire to pursue higher studies should be implemented because it is the government’s responsibility to help students obtain a degree and it will ease the burden on the family of those who really want to continue their studies.",8,university-education-should-be-free-for-all-students-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
438,Many people argue that online courses are better than offline courses. Discuss both the points and give your opinion.,"Online courses have become more popular over the years and many people opine that they are better than traditional classroom courses. While attending a class can improve a student’s concentration levels, courses on the internet can be more comfortable and flexible. I believe that education online is far more beneficial than the traditional classroom approach.
Regular classroom courses certainly have some benefits. There are fewer distractions in a classroom and there is a teacher who is present before him and he will make sure that the student’s attention is not diverted. Moreover, most of the time the facial expressions of students can help educators understand whether the class is interesting or not. For example, research showed that graduates in India still prefer going to coaching centers to learn new computer languages and other courses due to the fact that they can interact with tutors live and have undivided attention during the session. Yet, traditional courses are expensive. Also, they require the student to physically attend the class at a particular time and place.
On the other hand, online education can have several advantages. Firstly, students can attend any session from their home. So they don’t have to waste their time and energy travelling from home to college. Besides, home is a stress-free environment, so it helps them to understand the concepts better and they can ask questions confidently because there is no one around to make them feel shy. Secondly, online courses give access to a wide range of best tutors around the world. If a student is from a different region and would like to learn a course that is offered in another part of the globe, he can opt for an online course and learn about it. For instance, Germany is known for its automobile industry and most of the experts are from the same place, so if a person wants to learn about it and cannot afford to go there, then Skype sessions can be of great help.
To conclude, although regular classroom courses can have an emotional touch, online learning can be free of stress and enable students to learn different global courses right from the place they live. Hence, I agree with the argument that online programmes are better.",8,many-people-argue-that-online-courses-are-better-than-offline-courses-band-8-ielts-essay-sample-2
439,"Some people have the opinion that big shopping malls are expensive places as they offer high costs for the products which can be bought at much cheaper prices from local shops. On the other hand, some people think that such malls are absolutely the best places to visit for shopping. Discuss both the opinions and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The number of shopping centres in the cities is growing day by day. They have also started to appear in tier 2 cities and towns extensively. While a few people think these malls charge exorbitant prices for the products which can be bought in small shops at a much lower rate, there are others who contradict this view. According to them, shops in malls are the ideal places to go shopping. This essay examines both ideas and states my opinion.
To commence with, the products and services offered by shopping complexes are costlier than those offered by local stores. That is mainly because malls have higher operating costs. Also, the government imposes higher taxes on the products sold in malls. In addition, these places are flooded with fancy lights, attractive mannequins and centralized air conditioning. They even play areas for children and snacks corners. All of these factors increase the prices.
On the other hand, the glorious ambience of the shopping malls increases the prices but at the same time they contribute to a delightful shopping experience. They offer an extremely relaxing environment to shop at our ease and comfort. In addition to that, these outlets offer a plethora of choices from different brands all at one place and also in a more customer friendly manner. Lifestyle chain of stores, for example, showcases almost all brands of clothing in one place thus offering a lot of options to buyers. Sometimes these retail stores offer 30 to 40 percent discounts on many items which no other local shops can match.
To conclude, though malls are expensive compared to other shops, the value they add to the shopping experience is highly appreciated. In my opinion, the expanding presence of such complexes serves as proof for their success and implies that these are the best venues to do shopping.",8,some-people-have-the-opinion-that-big-shopping-malls-are-expensive-places-as-they-charge-higher-prices-for-products-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
440,"People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, increased knowledge). Why do you think people attend college or university?","Attending college is considered to be one of the most crucial decisions of a person’s life. There are several reasons why people decide to embark on university life / college life. College enables people to develop their intellect, gain new experiences and earn respect in the society.
Most people believe that in order to be successful they need to earn a degree first. In the past, a college education was not a crucial necessity to get a job. If you worked hard enough and had connections, you could find a job with little difficulty. Nowadays, the world has become more competitive and demanding. People need not only work experience, but also a good education to be able to find a decent job. Young people understand this and are willing to prepare themselves as well as they can to ensure their place in the workforce.
Another reason why people decide to go to college is that they want to enhance their perspectives. By having new experiences, young people can better comprehend how the world works. Usually, students need to face different types of situations at college such as working in teams, making presentations, speaking in public, and many more. All these assignments are designed to get you out of your comfort zone and make you experience an unfamiliar situation. Therefore, the best place to prepare yourself for the real world is college. Parental pressure is another factor that encourages students to go to college. The fear of disappointing them forces many youngsters to join college. Young people want to live up to their parents’ expectations, and they will go to any extent to make them happy.
In conclusion, there are many factors that may influence a person’s decision to attend college, but the most important one is the fear of not being successful.",8,why-do-you-think-people-attend-college-or-university-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
441,Some people think that the government should pay one of the parents of very young children to stay at home to look after their children. What do you think would be the advantages and disadvantages of this policy?,"Nowadays both the parents work due to financial reasons and because of their busy schedules, their children suffer. It is believed by some people that for children’s better upbringing and proper care, either mother or father should be paid to stay at home by the government. There are certainly some benefits to this practice; however, there are several disadvantages too.
To begin with, one of the obvious benefits of keeping one parent at home is that it ensures better care of the child. Needless to say, parents understand the needs of their children better than others because they share a stronger emotional bond with them. That is why if they stay with them, they will provide the best care and attention to their children. Money is the main reason that encourages both parents to work. If the government provides monetary assistance to one of them, they can stay at home without having to worry about meeting the expenses of raising a baby.
On the contrary, there are some drawbacks to having such policies as it will put extra burden on the government.  We all are aware that the government has many areas to work on such as education, poverty, employment and all of these require more funds. In order to pay money to parents, it has to reduce its spending in other areas and that might have even more adverse effects on a country’s economy. Also the parent who decides to stay home to care for the child may find it difficult to secure a good job once they decide to return to the job market.
To conclude, it is indeed true that a care provider cannot provide the same care as a parent. If the government offers financial assistance to one of the parents for staying at home, it will definitely benefit the child. However, it will put strain on the public exchequer.",8,some-people-think-that-the-government-should-pay-one-of-the-parents-of-very-young-children-to-stay-at-home-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
442,Art and music are considered by some as the fundamental elements of all societies. Do you think art and music still have a place in today’s modern world of technology? Should children spend more time in learning art and music at school?,"Every society considers art and music as the core components of their culture. In my opinion, the importance of art and music has only increased in this age of technology and hence students should be urged to learn them.
We are living in increasingly stressful times. Of course, technology has made our lives easier. It has created new industries and jobs that did not exist previously. However, technology has also introduced stress into our lives. Most people now have demanding jobs that drain out their energy. Art and music enable them to relax their mind and stay tuned to the rhythm of life after a hectic day at work.
Another reason art still maintains its relevance is that it unites people. Technology is a double edged sword. It can both connect and divide people. Miscreants use technology to promote their divisive agenda. In this troubled times people need something to unite them and art does that job perfectly. It is a common interest that we all share. For example, Indian music and art have a history of thousands of years and they have played an amazing role in uniting the country and its people over the course of history. Indians everywhere are proud of their musical traditions and brilliant sculptures and carving adorning their temples, palaces and monuments. Without these elements of culture, it is not possible to unite a heterogeneous mix of over a billion people.
As for the reasons to encourage students to learn art and music, despite the fact that we are living in a technology driven world, art is still a coveted career option. Music is known to soothe human minds and is widely integrated with every modern infotainment devices. In addition, now music therapy is used to relieve people of their stress and anxiety without any side-effects. I firmly believe that art and music are crucial disciplines even today and hence parents must encourage their children to learn them in depth. Even a general learning of these subjects is known to increase students’ proficiency in other academic subjects.
In conclusion, art and music have always been appreciated throughout the world and their popularity remains intact even today. Hence, it is recommended that children learn these subjects as they make them smarter and may also lead to a prosperous career.",8,do-you-think-art-and-music-still-have-a-place-in-todays-modern-world-of-technology-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
443,"Some people think that getting a degree from a university is the best way to guarantee a good job, others believe that it would be better to go straight into work and get experience instead. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Finding a good job is a herculean task in this challenging world. It is commonly believed that tertiary education is the best way to secure an ideal job. Although this view is supported by some, others have a strong counter-argument that gaining work experience is a better option. In my opinion, education and work experience are both equally important. It depends entirely upon the requirements of the job.
To commence with, it is globally accepted that a university degree is the key to great career opportunities. Some professions demand a set of skills that can only be gained by a detailed study of the subject in college. For example, to become a doctor, an engineer, an architect, and an advocate a university degree is a must in order to equip oneself with the comprehensive knowledge of the subject to cater to these professional requirements. Therefore, it is said that a certificate of tertiary education is extremely important to be in professions where high level skills and thorough knowledge are the first and foremost prerequisite.
On the contrary, there are professions which focus on experience rather than the degree. Entrepreneurship is one of the best examples in this category. For example, one does not need a university degree to open a restaurant or a workshop. These careers are based on practical experiences rather than university education. For example, in India the extremely successful small scale business named Lijat Pappad is owned and run by a  group of women who neither pursued studies nor possessed any degrees. Thus, it is evident that in some sectors experience is more important than formal educational qualifications.
To conclude, it is the nature of the job which requires whether education is more important than work experience. A university degree is a must in certain sectors whereas experience is more relevant in some other sectors.",8,some-people-think-that-getting-a-degree-from-a-university-is-the-best-way-to-guarantee-a-good-job-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
444,"Discipline is an ever increasing problem in modern schools. Some people think that discipline should be the responsibility of teachers, while others think that this is the role of parents. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Discipline is important for the all round development of children; however, nowadays many students seem to lack it. According to some people parents are responsible for inculcating the value of discipline in their children; others insist that it is the duty of teachers. I agree with the former view.
Different schools have different subjects depending on the child’s age and each subject is taught by a specific teacher. It is highly unlikely that each teacher teaches the same standards of discipline to all pupils across all grades. Each child is different and has to be molded depending on the child’s behavior. To illustrate further, the school near my house has 40 students in one class. The teacher often finds it very difficult to control the class and teach the lesson within the allotted time. The teacher is more concerned about explaining the lesson and completing the course and gives less attention to those who misbehave in their class.
On the contrary, parents observe their kid very closely since their birth. They tend to spend a lot of time with their children during their free time at home. Since they interact more with their child, they have an opportunity to teach them discipline and mend their behavior. Children often try to imitate their parents and learn behavioral skills from them. For example, my son wakes up early in the morning and gets ready for school as we all get ready for our offices. This behavior was not taught by any of us; rather it was something he learned from his own observation.
To conclude this essay, teachers in this modern era find it extremely difficult to discipline all the children and mend their ways within the allotted time. It is the responsibility of the parents to discipline their child and show them what is right and wrong.",8,discipline-is-an-ever-increasing-problem-in-modern-schools-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
445,Some people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"According to some people, only those who have demanding hobbies can have fun. I totally disagree with this view. In my opinion, a hobby whether it is relaxing or challenging can be pleasurable and people usually choose their hobby based on their personal situations and interest.
To begin with, some people find it more enjoyable when they spend their leisure time doing activities that are more relaxed, rather than complicated. This is because they might be working in a stressful environment. For them, a hobby is a way to relax their body and mind and feel energised for their work the next day. If, instead, they pick up a challenging hobby, it will require a lot of their efforts and time and they might find it hard to cope with their daily routine. In many cases they may just give up on their hobby.
On the other hand, some people only have fun when they do activities that are demanding. The reason for this is that they want to push their limits and learn new things during their free time. The hobby, as per them, is a way to enhance their knowledge and develop skills. For example, photography is a favourite pastime of many people. Although learning to click and edit pictures is a demanding and time-consuming activity, many people still enjoy this hobby. It is because of the satisfaction they get when they are able to successfully learn it.
Personally, I feel that people should choose a hobby based on their liking and other personal circumstances and not on the basis of its difficulty level. Whether the hobby is challenging or relaxing does not matter as long as people are able to have fun taking part in it.
To conclude, while some people enjoy relaxing hobbies because of their hectic work schedule, others find arduous hobbies more interesting and fun as it enables them to push their boundaries. In my opinion, both types of hobbies can be enjoyable and people should choose one based on their interest and personal conditions.",8,some-people-believe-that-hobbies-need-to-be-difficult-to-be-enjoyable-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
446,Young people today spend more time than ever before playing video games. This is harmful to their physical and social development. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays youngsters enjoy playing video games and as a result, they spent a great deal of time on their computers. Although playing video games has a negative effect on their physical and emotional growth and development, it has a few benefits too. Hence, I can only partially agree with the given argument that video games are harmful for children.
Playing videos games excessively can hurt the physical and sociological development of children in numerous ways. Firstly when young children are addicted to playing video games they spent a lot of time sitting in front of their computers and they may hardly do other physical activities. Due to this situation, young people may not receive adequate exercise and they may become obese. In addition, this addiction to playing these games prevent children from going out to socialize with their friends and play other games such as football and hockey, which provide exercise to the body. Due to this, these youngsters may not be able to make friends in the society or engage in any social activity, which may help to build the social network they may require in future to be a successful person. Furthermore, many video games have violent content and children playing them may demonstrate aggressive and antisocial behaviour. Hence playing video games can be harmful for youngsters both socially and physiologically.
On the other hand, playing these kinds of games can also benefit them. Some video games enhance the creativity of children and enable them to take quick decisions in emergency situations. A good example is the specially designed pilot training software. Moreover, some video games allow playing in teams and they may be helpful to make a virtual network of friends.
In conclusion, playing video games can be harmful to the physical and sociological development of children by making them obese and antisocial even though these games can improve their decision-making abilities and creativity.",8,young-people-today-spend-more-time-than-ever-before-playing-video-games-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
447,Many People are choosing to find information online rather than in books. Is this positive or negative development?,"The internet is a treasure house of information. Today an increasing number of people prefer to find information through web sources rather than books. In my opinion, this is a positive development which benefits the environment and helps save money.
Firstly, discovering information online plays a vital role in protecting the environment. When people depend on websites for news and information, trees do not have to be cut down to produce paper. This helps save the forest cover and reduces the impact of global warming. Thus it is evident that finding information online is beneficial for the environment.
Secondly, most of the information online can be accessed for free or at minimal costs. By contrast, paper based books and magazines are expensive and poor people cannot afford them. To cite an example, a large number of research students complete their thesis by accessing data for their project on websites like Scribd.com where most of the journals can be downloaded for free.
Of course, there are some downsides to using the internet for finding information. To start with, it is not always possible to verify the accuracy of online data. There are also some health risks to excessive usage of digital devices. It can cause eye fatigue, blurred or strained vision.
To recapitulate, finding information online is a positive development because it helps save the environment by reducing the use of paper. Also, online information is readily available to all sections of the society. Of course, excessive use of the internet can lead to some health problems but they can be overcome by limiting the hours of usage.",8,many-people-are-choosing-to-find-information-online-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
448,Many people try to look younger than their real age. What are the reasons people do this? Is this a good or bad thing?,"It is undeniable that a lot of people try to hide their real age and attempt to look younger. In fact many people dislike the question about their age and find it embarrassing. Personally, I think this is because aging has been associated with many diseases and illnesses, whereas looking young always reflects beauty and good health. However, this obsession with looking young has many negative effects on individuals and societies.
To begin with, the need to defeat aging is not a new trend as people throughout the history were always fascinated by the strength and the charm of young people. For example, many ancient civilizations claimed that they had found the secret of eternal youth. This phenomenon has never changed in the modern age. Inspired by the media and celebrities who always ensure that they never get old people are now more concerned about their age and ready to do anything to keep their young looks. Thus youngsters’ need to look good is related to the influence of popular culture and media.
Unfortunately, this is not a positive thing for several reasons. Firstly, many individuals are being obsessed with their age to such an extent that they splurge on cosmetics products and surgeries. This in turn has devastating impacts on their general health. For instance, studies have shown a strong link between breast cancer and breast enlargement surgery. Secondly, many people, who try to look younger, act like youngsters as well, with all its recklessness and issues ignoring the wisdom that is supposed to come with aging. Therefore, the attempt to defy aging is harmful to both individuals and communities.
To conclude, the obsession with looking young is fuelled by many factors including peer pressure and media influence. Unfortunately, this is a negative trend and hence it should be discouraged. People need to realize that there is no harm in getting old and rather than trying to look young, they should learn to appreciate the wisdom and maturity that come with aging.",8,many-people-try-to-look-younger-than-their-age-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
449,Many people argue that online courses are better than offline courses. Discuss both the points and give your opinion.,"While some people argue that it is better to do online courses than regular courses, others insist that regular class room courses are more beneficial. In my opinion, online courses are way more advantageous than offline ones as they are more interactive, and can be accessed anytime from anywhere.
One the one hand, many people support the idea that online courses are better as they deliver the course content in a very interesting and interactive way, which makes learning more effective. Online study material and lectures provide the information in the form of video with graphical representations making it easy to understand and retain the concepts and vital information. Moreover, both recorded and live sessions of online courses can be accessed at the click of a single button through devices like personal computers, laptops and smart phones. For Instance, teachers from Delhi are teaching mathematics to students in London through live sessions available 24 hours.
On the other hand, it is also believed by some that offline courses are better since they give an opportunity to a student to interact with a teacher face to face and thus establish a direct connection between them. It helps a teacher to deliver the lecture in the best possible way and help the student to perform well in his/her subject / course. Another reason why offline courses are considered better is that the student can learn from their fellow students which makes learning more practical and illustrative.
However, offline programmes tend to be more expensive than online programmes. Also, in order to attend a regular course, a student has to be physically present in the classroom. This is not possible for people who have a full time job. Online programmes, by contrast, can be accessed at a time convenient to the learner.
To conclude, there are many persuasive ideas in support of both the arguments but it is my strong conviction that online courses are far better than offline courses because students can learn more effectively through digital interactive sessions at the click of a single button while sitting at home.",8,many-people-argue-that-online-courses-are-better-than-offline-courses-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
450,"It is generally accepted that exercise is good for children and teenagers. Therefore, physical education and sport should be compulsory for all students in all schools. What do you think?","According to a large number of people, exercise is good for young children and teenagers. Hence, schools should make physical education and sports mandatory for all students. In my opinion, I completely agree with this idea of giving importance to physical education and sport in the school curriculum.
To start with, exercise is the key to physical and mental health. It keeps the body of a child active and brings enthusiasm in him to complete other activities during the day. As most of the physical exercises are done in open grounds, they give young people a chance to connect with the nature. In addition, youngsters who play sports on a regular basis learn to accept success and defeat gracefully. These players get to compare their performance with each other and get encouraged to perform better. Team spirit is also one of the major benefits of playing sports which includes team participation.
Moreover, these exercises and sports help children to fight their sedentary lifestyle. For example, a child who has a sports competition next week will practice his skills at home as well. It also encourages the parents to spend their time with their children to train them for the league. This makes the entire family shift towards a healthy lifestyle that consists of regular physical exercise. Introducing exercise in the school timetable helps students to get a break from the exhaustive academic subjects and return to it with renewed interest.

451,People sleep less than before. Why? And what are the effects of this?,"It is true that our sleeping patterns have changed significantly over the last fifty years. People now get considerably less sleep than their ancestors. Personally, l think this is because of the increasing stress and the effects of the digital age . However, this phenomenon has serious repercussions for individuals and societies.
To begin with, the competitive and hectic lifestyle of the modern times requires people to be more attentive than ever before. Nowadays, people are in a constant race to fulfil their basic needs and to achieve their goals and as a result they get less time for sleep. Sleeping less is actually considered as a virtue these days. For example, most high-profile personalities with amazing achievements such as Bill Gates take pride in cutting down on their in their rest hours and consider that a key for success. Furthermore, the computer era has surrounded us with a huge number of screens which have a major effect on our conscious brains. Studies have shown that the blue light of computer, television and mobile screens makes the brain more awake and prevents it from falling asleep.
Unfortunately, this trend is a serious problem that has a negative impact on the well-being of communities. For instance, less sleeping hours can cause tiredness, depression, lack of concentration as well as many health problems including obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. All of these issues will eventually result in a weak society with low productivity. Thus, sufficient sleep is vital for individuals and nations.
In conclusion, after looking at why people sleep less and what problems this cause, it is hoped that governments around the world launch education campaigns to inform the public about the importance of getting adequate sleep.",8,people-sleep-less-than-before-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
452,"These days, people change careers several times during their life. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?","The trend of switching jobs has gained popularity in recent times. In this essay, I will discuss both the benefits and drawbacks of this trend / change.
To begin with the positives, a significant advantage is that people gain a wide range of experience when they change jobs. This is because they get exposed to new technologies, working culture and operational models used in different companies. As a result, they obtain diverse knowledge. Besides gaining experience, they may get a steep hike in their salary when they accept a new offer.  While it is possible to get a rise while working in the same company, it is usually negligible compared to what they get when join a new company. This can be illustrated by the fact that organisations usually give around 2-5% increment to their current employees. However, they offer around 8-10% hike to workers joining them from another company.
Nevertheless, changing companies frequently does have some serious drawbacks, the most obvious of which is the necessity to prove themselves. They might be a valuable resource in their previous company but to win the trust of senior members of the organization and gain the same status in the new company, they need to really work hard during their initial years. This can often result in frustration. Another crucial demerit of this trend is that these people need to wait longer for becoming part of management since most of the top positions are usually occupied by employees who have a long association with the company.
To sum up, despite the fact that changing jobs may enable people to earn higher salaries and gain diverse experience, it has its downsides worth considering. People who switch jobs frequently have to prove themselves again and again and also wait longer for a promotion.",8,these-days-people-change-careers-several-times-during-their-life-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
453,"Some people say that television is useful in education, while others say it is useful only for entertainment. Do you agree or disagree?","Although television channels today telecast many educational shows most of these programmes are targeted at mature people and not children. Most of the children watch TV to see their favourite cartoon characters.  Therefore, I disagree with the argument that children must be encouraged to use television as an educational tool for their studies.
Because many informative channels such as Discovery, Animal Planet, BBC, and many more are available to watch, it does not guarantee that children will gain knowledge by watching them. In fact, kids are smarter these days and if they are granted permission to view TV they will watch programmes that they like. For instance, children are addicted to cartoons and if they are not under parent’s supervision, they will watch only cartoons and sports channels, and not the channels they were are supposed to watch. Children consider a television as an entertainment device and not as an educational tool. So, it is not advisable to encourage children to watch TV.
Secondly, when kids watch TV for long hours, it puts strain on their eyes. For instance, a cousin of mine who is ten years old used to spend around eight hours a day watching TV and playing video games. Today at this young age he suffers from frequent headaches and is forced to wear glasses. That is the reason doctors advise parents to restrict the amount of time children can spend watching TV.
To conclude there are channels that provide information and knowledge, but these are more beneficial for adults than kids. Children must learn using the traditional methods of learning. They can also use tools like computers and the internet, but not television because to the best of my understanding it is not an efficient educational tool.",8,some-people-say-television-is-useful-in-education-while-others-say-it-is-useful-only-for-entertainment-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
454,"Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial; however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?","It is commonly believed that preservation of environment is imperative, yet most people do absolutely nothing to save the planet. In this essay, I will first highlight certain problems which deteriorate our “Mother Earth” and then discuss the possible remedies for it.
To begin with, lack of awareness programmes in schools is the foremost reason why the vast majority of masses tend to neglect environmental issues. Needless to say, unlike in the developed countries, school pupils of developing countries barely get educated about crucial issues pertaining to environment. For instance, in Pakistan, the school curriculum does not include lessons on environment. As a result, children become negligent and tend to take the environment for granted. If schools had made it mandatory to teach the subjects like, waste management and recycling, young people would grow up with a sense of responsibility towards the preservation of natural resources. Thus, local education commissions should take numerous initiatives to include environmental sciences in educational syllabus.
Similarly, corporations barely demonstrate a sense of commitment towards saving the planet from destruction. For example, despite the rules and regulations imposed by the government, factories exploit the legal loopholes and dump hazardous waste in the sea. Similarly, smoke from industrial chimneys is believed to be the major cause of global warming. This is because the companies ignore the long-term effects of such actions on our future generations for the sake of some short term gains. If establishments and manufacturers had taken, the detrimental effects of industrial pollution, in to consideration, planet earth would be cleaner and greener.
To conclude, although preserving the natural resources is of immense importance, the educational bodies and corporate entities seem ignorant of this fact. If the children obtain theoretical and practical knowledge about this issue, and companies take responsibility of their waste management procedures, we can save the planet from further deterioration.",8,some-people-believe-that-preserving-natural-environment-is-crucial-but-most-make-no-effort-to-do-so-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
455,Nowadays people prefer readymade food instead of home cooked food. Discuss the advantage and disadvantage of the same.,"It is observed that now many people have readymade meal in place of homemade food. In my opinion, this trend has its own merits and demerits and this essay shall throw some light on both the aspects.
Readymade food is gaining popularity because of the convenience provided by it. People can have it while traveling, working or doing some other chore and it saves precious cooking time. Nowadays, everybody is busy and they do not have time to cook proper meals at home. To exemplify, according to a recent survey, 55% of the working population below the age of 45 prefers to have a readymade meal just because it is convenient to have it.
On the flip side, there are some negative aspects to ready-to-eat meals. The most important among them are the health consequences. This kind of food is usually low on nutritional values, and mostly contains harmful preservatives which impact the health negatively since they have carcinogenic properties. It is also thought to be addictive and people who have consumed it once will probably want to consume it again and again. Unfortunately, regular consumption of ready-to-eat food may cause various health problems.
To conclude, the main benefit of readymade food is that it saves cooking time but at the same time it leads to health problems. By contrast, food prepared at home is healthy although it takes a lot of time to cook at home. In my opinion, it is all right to have ready to eat food once in a while, but its regular consumption should be avoided at all costs.",8,nowadays-people-prefer-readymade-food-instead-of-home-cooked-food-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
456,"More and more people are working at home rather than in the workplace. Some people say this will bring benefits to the workers and their families, others think this will bring stress to the home. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","An increasing number of people are choosing to work from home in recent years. While some people insist this trend is beneficial for the employees and their families, others argue that it causes unnecessary tension at home. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the latter view.
On the one hand, those who advocate that working from home is useful for the workers and families feel that it gives them the flexibility to work as per their convenience. This is because when they are not going to the job they need not follow the usual office hours.  As a result, they choose to work at a time when their productivity is the highest. Furthermore, by not going to office, they save travelling time which can be utilized to work on their assignments and finish them early so that they can spend more time with their family members.
On the other hand, for many reasons, I believe that this option leads to more tension in the family life. Firstly, there is no limit to how long one should sit and work at home. This absence of rules at home usually leads to people working longer than normal routine, which is one of the prime reasons for domestic fights. Secondly, people miss important informal communication that happens over tea in the office. For example, they may not get to hear about new vacancies that have arisen in the workplace. This can result in frustration and they might take this out on their family members.",8,more-and-more-people-are-working-at-home-rather-than-in-the-workplace-some-people-think-this-will-bring-stress-to-home-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
457,Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"In this age of globalization, many people seem to have lost interest in their regional languages. As a result, many languages are dying out especially the native ones. Some people think that it is not important to protect them as life will be easier with fewer languages. I do not agree with this perception and would like to further explain my stand in this essay.
I believe language is the fundamental tool to understand the culture, traditions, and thought process of different communities. Language greatly helps in researching useful facts about far-flung places outside the cities. It can have scientific and educational significance. Also, many kinds of literature, songs, and poems are narrated only in local languages. For example, there are many famous pieces of folk music and lyrics written in the regional languages of the northern and southern parts of India.
It may not be feasible to learn multiple languages at the same time. However, it has been observed that learning and speaking multiple languages is beneficial to the mind. Psychological studies have proven that multilingual ability is an asset to the cognitive process. It enhances problem solving skills, decision-making ability and exercises our brain activities.
Although it is argued that more languages cause confusion and difficulty in conversing, I feel it is a false perception. People can use their mother tongue for conversing with their family and friends and an international language like English for official communication. For example, I live in Mumbai and use Hindi to communicate with my colleagues, friends and strangers but at home I chat in Punjabi which is my mother tongue. I also understand Marathi because it is my state language. My understanding of multiple languages has only benefited me in my professional and personal life.
In summary, I suppose attempts should be made to preserve dying languages as much possible. The essence and originality of some artistic, literary and methodical works might disappear and it may no longer be accessible if languages vanish. These advantages overweigh any difficulty that we might encounter because of the existence of multiple languages in the world.",8,every-year-several-languages-die-out-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
458,News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. What factors do you think influence these decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?,"News that we obtain from various sources can be positive, negative or just informative. Mostly, it is the news editor who decides what to broadcast or print and oftentimes their decisions are influenced by their political or ideological interests. Apparently, bad news gets more coverage than good news. I believe the proportion of good news reported should be increased.
Several factors influence the decisions of the news editor. Before they publish a piece of news, the first thing they consider is whether it protects their interests. For example, a newspaper that believes in environmental protection may give excessive importance to news about global warming, Arctic ice melting or deforestation. Likewise, some newspapers have political interests. They will only publish news that benefits the political party they support. Gaining more viewers or readers is the biggest priority of all media houses. News channels compete with one another to report the news first to increase their show’s Television Rating Points (TRP). For example, the news channel that first broadcast the devastation caused by a terror attack or a widespread fire will definitely attract more viewers.
Secondly, I suppose news that is national and regional is also prioritized. News channels are inclined to cover news related to politics, sports, films, and achievements of the country in detail and just highlight the relevant happenings abroad. Thirdly, some news editors are driven by social causes such as cleanliness drive, malnutrition, and women empowerment. For example, popular newspapers like Times of India routinely highlight illegal or antisocial activities so that the government can take action.
It has also been observed that news editors tend to give more coverage to bad news. This is because many of us are naturally inclined to news that creates shock or awe. What’s more, the coverage of bad news allows people to stay informed of the threats they face. For example, a news series on stolen or hacked credit cards might be helpful for the general public to be more aware and alert.
In summary, news editors are influenced by various factors and these include political pressures and business interests. I believe it would be much better if media gave more importance to feel good news such as those concerning economic achievements, acts of bravery or scientific breakthroughs.",8,news-editors-decide-what-to-broadcast-on-television-and-what-to-print-in-newspapers-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
459,All over the world societies are facing a growing problem with obesity. Obesity affects both children and adults. What are the reasons for this rise in obesity? How can it be tackled?,"As our society progresses, the number of obese people also seems to increase. As per estimation by Centre and Disease Control (CDC), in 2016, over 12% of the global population was obese and it included 41 million children under the age of five years. These figures seem to be growing day by day.
One of the obvious reasons is our sedentary way of living. Most of the office jobs these days demand sitting long hours in front of the computers. Many people tend to avoid walking even for short distances and prefer private vehicles. Regular exercise does not seem to fit into our busy schedules. We tend to choose escalator or elevator over the staircase. Moreover, the technological comforts of internet and smartphones keep many physically inactive.
Another important reason is our high-calorie and fat-prone diet. With the advent of flourishing branded outlets and their advertisements, most youngsters tend to gobble up pizzas, burgers, and French fries. As the quantity of trans fats, cholesterol, and triglycerides are abnormally high in such foods, fat deposition builds up faster in the body and leads to obesity.
In order to tackle this, every individual should be made aware of the importance of being healthy.  This can be achieved by creating more awareness programs at schools, colleges, and offices. For example, an office HR should motivate employees to take part in Marathon. Civic bodies should establish more recreational parks, health clubs and promote Yoga Centers. Fitness promotional activities and initiatives should be encouraged by the government at the national level. For example, recent fitness challenge initiatives by the sports minister on social media sites were constructive and informative.
In conclusion, the complacent lifestyle and inappropriate dietary habits cause obesity. Promoting healthy lifestyles and creating awareness about the dreadful consequences of the consumption of junk food are the only ways to tackle the menace of obesity.",8,all-over-the-world-societies-are-facing-a-growing-problem-with-obesity-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
460,Some parents buy their children a large number of toys to play with. What are the advantages and disadvantages for the child of having a large number of toys?,"It is true that the parents nowadays spend a huge amount of money for buying toys for their children. There are certain advantages to buying toys for children; however, the disadvantages are also worth considering. Both sides will be discussed in this essay.
The main benefit of buying expensive toys is that they serve an educational purpose. Parents believe that by playing with interactive games, children will enhance their learning skills and understanding. Many toys are designed to clarify educational concepts. For example, Scrabble helps improve vocabulary and word generation ideas. Consequently, children who play with educational toys can become smarter than their peers. Secondly, in families where both parents work, it is extremely difficult for them to dedicate enough time for the children. As a result, parents buy toys for their children so that it can compensate for the time they are unable to spend with children.
Despite the above mentioned positive arguments, there are some disadvantages to having too many toys. The biggest problem is that children become introverts. In the past, toddlers used to play outdoor games with their peers which in turn helped them develop skills such as leadership and team work. On the contrary, now they are becoming reclusive because they play alone with their toys. Therefore, they do not easily mingle with others. Moreover, family ties are weakening among this generation of children. As they spend less time with their parents and more time with non-living objects, they are not attached to their parents. This discourages them from sharing their emotions with their parents. Surveys have shown that teenagers are more comfortable sharing their feelings with their toys than their parents. Obviously, children are impacted when they have too many toys to play with.
To conclude, playing with toys certainly benefit children because it enables them to learn many new things and acquire useful skills. However, if children spend too much time with their toys or if they have too many toys, they may become introverts with poor social skills.",8,some-parents-buy-their-children-a-large-number-of-toys-to-play-with-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
461,Over sugar consumption is unhealthy. Some people think that governments should take responsibility to control it. Others think that individuals should take responsibility of sugar intake. Discuss both the views and give your opinion?,"Eating sugar in excessive amounts can lead to health problems. According to some people, governments are responsible for their citizens’ health and hence they ought to control sugar consumption while others opine that it is the duty of individuals. In my opinion, everyone should take care of their own health and control the intake of sugar as they understand their body requirements better than others.
It is the moral duty of the government to keep the nation healthy and fit. There are many ways through which excess sugar consumption can be controlled by the government. Firstly, the government should impose higher taxes on sugar and sugary products. For example, if the government levies a high tax rate on these products, their selling prices will be increased and people will be discouraged to buy them. Therefore, consumption will automatically go down. Secondly, governments should run health awareness programs to educate people about the adverse ramifications of over sugar intake. If they are aware of the negative side of having excess sugar, they will share the same with their family and friends too and this will motivate them not to include excess sugar in their diet.
On the other hand, no one can take care of a person’s health better than themselves as individuals know their own body requirements better. Also, everyone is different and cannot be measured on the same scale. For instance, if someone has a family history of diabetes then he should take precautions and consume less sugar than the others because he is more likely to develop diabetes.  In addition, there are multiple ways through which people can regulate their sugar cravings. For example, they can use sugar-free products instead of real sugar.
To conclude, although governments should take the initiative to control excessive sugar intake, in my opinion, largely, it is the responsibility of individuals to restrict themselves from consuming more sugar and take precautions to avoid any negative consequences on health.",8,over-sugar-consumption-is-unhealthy-some-people-think-that-governments-should-take-responsibility-to-control-it-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
462,"If you sell a product and people buy it, then advertising it is not necessary and considered as a kind of entertainment. Do you agree or disagree?","Marketing and advertising have always been an integral part of the sales process. However, many people believe that advertising is pointless if the product is already selling well. I do not agree with this viewpoint as advertisements offer many other benefits to the manufacturers.
To begin with, it is undeniable that advertising increases profits as it plays a major role in convincing people to buy the advertised product by giving the feeling that life with it can be happier and more comfortable. For example, studies have shown that even if a particular product is widely consumed, using adverts will spur more people to make the purchase, which of course ensure the success of the business. In addition to that, adverts are essential to illustrate the benefits of the product and explain how it functions.
On the other hand, advertising encourages loyalty among customers and increase their trust in the company. This would restrict any competition from other manufacturers who wish to produce similar products. For instance, the engaging and continuous advertising of Pepsi cola has made it the dominating soft drink brand despite the fact that several other companies are trying to make a name in this industry. Thus the role of advertising extends beyond providing entertainment. It builds brand value and recognition.
In conclusion, after analysing the previous points, it is clear that promoting products is vital as many positive merits are drawn from this practice. Therefore, it is recommended that all companies launch advertising campaigns that allow their products to reach the widest possible market.",8,if-you-sell-a-product-and-people-buy-it-there-is-no-need-to-advertise-it-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
463,"Nowadays, people are living an increasingly longer life and in many countries, there are more old people than young people. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?","In this progressive world, technological and medical advancements have increased the life expectancy. This increase in life span has created a situation in many countries where they have a higher proportion of aged people. This essay will delve into the pros and cons of this phenomenon.
To begin with, there are many plausible reasons for the increase in the lifespan of human beings. The first one is the improvement in medical science and invention of vaccines for nearly every disease. The second one is the availability of cutting edge technology with which doctors can do early diagnosis of the disease and start the treatment on time. Improved health care systems and awareness campaigns have also boosted longevity. For instance, according to a report published by WHO, Japan has a very low mortality rate, because they are very proactive at diagnosing a medical condition in its early stage.
The upside of living a longer life has many aspects. Firstly, people can spend longer time with their loved ones. Secondly, the old people have more knowledge and wisdom that they can impart to young people. Thirdly, the upcoming generation expects to live a longer life and can plan for it accordingly.
There is also a downside to it in the form of increased burden of healthcare cost on the government. There will be fewer young professionals to replace the retiring population. In addition, this will impact the economic growth of the country, and it may have to rely on immigrants to boost the economy. Also, it will raise a security concern for a country because of the lack of of young blood in armed forces to safeguard its borders.
In conclusion, despite the fact that the disadvantages of having more old people outweigh the advantages, the mortality rate will keep falling due to advancement in medical science.",8,people-are-living-an-increasingly-longer-life-and-there-are-more-old-people-than-young-people-in-many-countries-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
464,Many things that used to be done in the home by hands are now being done by machines. Does this development bring more advantages or disadvantages?,"Home appliances have significantly advanced from what they were a couple of years back. Machines that were semi automatic have now evolved into fully automatic. These gadgets are the virtual hand of many homemakers in today’s homes. In this essay, we will discuss the positive and negative aspects of these home appliances.
It is evident and true and these appliances have reduced the labour required to perform many household tasks that were earlier done with hand. Thanks to the advent of appliances like washing machines, dishwashers and vacuum cleaners, the majority of household tasks can now be done with little effort. For instance, a homemaker can wash clothes, clean dishes and vacuum the house simultaneously and can save time by multitasking. These machines enable people to save time which they can be used for something more fruitful. Besides saving time, these machines complete the task more efficiently than humans who work with hands.
A major negative aspect of these machines taking over the control of our house chores is that they are making most of the people unhealthy and lazy. Since 80% of these tasks are automated and taken care of by these appliances, we become lazy. For instance, before these machines arrived most of the tasks were done by people, and they had to get physically active while accomplishing these works. Since most of the jobs are now taken care of by these machines, homemakers sit idle and become unhealthy and lazy.",8,many-things-that-used-to-be-done-in-the-home-by-hands-are-now-being-done-by-machines-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
465,Some people believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people. While others disagree .Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Technology is advancing by leaps and bounds. Some people believe that the latest technological innovations are widening the gap between the rich and the poor, whereas others disagree with this view. In my opinion, technology does not increase the gap between the rich and the poor; rather it provides several advantages to the poor sections of the society.
It is true that only the rich have access to certain technological innovations. For example, Apple iPhones are expensive devices that only rich people can buy. Actually, these days flaunting an iPhone or some other expensive gadget is the easiest way to show that you are upper class. In this way, technological advancements certainly divide the rich and poor sections of the society.
On the flip side, there are less expensive and dirt cheap alternatives to almost all gadgets. For example, it is possible to buy a mobile phone that has more or less the same features as an iPhone for one-tenth of its price. When it comes to technology price is not always an indicator of quality or functionality. Actually, as technology advances products become cheaper and affordable to all and sundry. For example, almost everyone now owns a mobile phone and uses it for various personal and other purposes. Data plans have become quite cheap and even the poorest can now access the internet on their mobile and benefit from this treasure trove of information. Small farmers, manufacturers and content creators are selling their products and services on the internet and finding buyers all over the world. In fact, technology has created a level playing field and lowered the entry barrier.
To conclude, technological innovations have a positive impact on all sections of the society. While some inventions of technology are still not accessible to the poor, the argument that technology increases the gap between the rich and the poor does not hold much water. In my opinion, rather than widening the gap, cheap modern technology is benefitting the poor by providing them an opportunity to compete with the rich.",8,some-people-believe-that-modern-technology-is-increasing-the-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
466,Cricket has become more popular than the national sports in the sub-continental countries. What do you think are the reasons behind this? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Cricket, traditionally an English sport, is becoming increasingly popular in other parts of the world like Australia, South Africa, West Indies and the Indian subcontinent. The level of interest in Cricket in these countries has increased to such an extent that it has surpassed the popularity of national sports. In my opinion, there are mainly two reasons for this popularity. To start with, all countries where cricket is now popular were once colonies of Britain. Another reason is the popularity of mass media. There are sports channels exclusively for cricket.
Until the dawn of the 20th century, many countries were under the British rule and hence their influence on everything including food, clothes and even sports was substantial. Before the British invaded these countries, there were several other sports that were played in these regions such as Hockey, Kabaddi etc. But under their rule, these sports saw a tremendous decline in popularity as these games were highly discouraged by them. Hence in order to keep up with the British, many people started adopting the games that Englishmen played; hence cricket found its roots in these countries almost 200 years ago. In a recent study conducted by the Ministry of Sports in India, cricket is watched by over 80% of the people across the country and merely 20% watch other games. They concluded that hockey, which is the national sport of India has comparatively fewer followers than cricket.
Apart from the political, commercial and colonial reasons there are multiple other factors which have led to the popularity of cricket. Mass media has played an important role here. There are numerous channels in these regions which focus entirely on cricket rather than any other sports. They broadcast Cricket all day long and that too in various languages so that their target audience is not reduced. Media has played another important part in making the players of the game celebrities. In a recent study conducted by Forbes magazine India, it was revealed that the players of national sports such as hockey barely make Rs 20,000 a month whereas a cricket player makes as high as 8 lakhs a month. Since the variation in pay is huge, it is obvious that people will focus more on cricket rather on any other sport.
To conclude, one can say that the colonial hangover is the major factor that has made Cricket the most popular sport in the Indian sub-continent. Although after independence, we have made new laws, popularized new games, we even declared hockey as our national sports, citizens of our country still have a greater inclination toward cricket than any other sports.",8,cricket-has-become-more-popular-than-the-national-sports-in-the-sub-continental-countries-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
467,Nowadays people get married and have children after the age of 30. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your opinion and examples based on your experiences.,"Marriage is a very important event in everyone’s life. It is a fact that nowadays, people are mostly getting married after the age of 30. I believe that the negative impact of this trend is more serious than the positive impact.
People prefer to marry after the age of 30 because of some reasons. One of the important reasons is that they give priority to their careers first. We want to be financially stable and strong enough to properly take charge of the new responsibility. Financial back-up is very much necessary in order to lead a happy married life. For instance, it is seen that most of the tensions and internal conflicts in families are due to the monetary crisis, which is the biggest threat to any marriage. Therefore, we want to be financially stable and well established in our careers in order to take up any new relationship to the next level.
However, the negative aspect is more dangerous. One of the biggest problems that ladies face after getting married at an advanced age is the risk of infertility. As a result, the entire family suffers for a lifetime, which is emotionally more painful to bear. In a recent study, it was found out that the infertility risk is more for women who are planning to conceive in their 30s and it doubles once they cross the age of 40s. This is a very common scenario among the working women who are highly ambitious and want to be successful in their lives. Unfortunately, if they fail to conceive, then they will pay a bigger price than they bargained for. What’s more, growing cases of infertility is a major threat to our society and our race.
In conclusion, though the positive side of marrying late are certainly evident, the negative impacts are more alarming and therefore they cannot be ignored; hence I believe that such developments are negative for the society.",8,nowadays-people-get-married-and-have-children-after-the-age-of-30-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
468,"While it is sometimes thought that prison is the best place for criminals, others believe that there are better ways to deal with them.","Some people believe that prisons are the best place for keeping criminals, while others contradict this idea and insist that there are more efficient ways to reform them. In my opinion, criminals who are a potential threat to the society must be locked up whereas those with the desire to transform themselves must be allowed a chance to get involved in reformatory work.
Serious offenders who have been convicted of heinous crimes undoubtedly possess the ability to harm the society so they must be confined within a jail. The criminal intentions and motivations they have cannot be detected or discouraged using peaceful means. That means there is always the possibility that they will reoffend and wreak havoc in the society if they are allowed to move out of prison.
Even if they are deterred / prevented from committing crime outside prisons, they can influence young and needy minds to follow their footsteps and thus augment the crime rate. Thus, no fruitful result can be generated in the process.
However, juvenile offenders and other criminals who have been jailed for comparatively minor offences must be allowed a second chance to redesign their lives. They must be granted an opportunity to correct them and be absorbed into the society. Firstly, arrangements should be made so that juvenile offenders receive vocational training and moral education which will teach them to distinguish noble from evil, and become law-abiding citizens. Secondly, adults must be involved in vocational trainings and skill development sessions that will enable them to find a means of livelihood and stay immune to criminal tendencies.
In conclusion, it is not realistic to make and follow general rules for all criminals.Before determining whether a criminal should be sent to prison or not, it is important to consider the gravity of the crime committed by them. While a criminal with a dangerous record is a threat to peace and must be in a prison, the others who committed relatively milder crimes can be given an opportunity for reforming themselves.",8,some-people-think-that-prison-is-the-best-place-for-criminals-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
469,Many working people get little or no exercise either during the working day or in their free time and have health problems as a result. Why do so many working people not get enough exercise? What can be done about this problem?,"The majority of full-time employees devote hardly any time for physical activity and exercise. This causes an increase in incidences of obesity, heart diseases, and lethargy. This essay will analyse the reasons that prevent people from exercising and also recommend some viable solutions.
People who work full-time are caught up in meeting the deadlines and often work overtime. Everyone is in a rush to beat the traffic congestion and reach their office on time. As a result, they often buy / choose junk food for breakfast or lunch as it is easily available and ready to eat. The consumption of junk food causes an increase in cases of obesity) and makes people lazy due to the high content of sodium and carbohydrates in them. Apart from this, employees often complain about lack of time for exercise or any fitness related activity. They feel stressed about finishing their tasks on time and often work overtime. Moreover, many workers, especially those who must travel long distances to reach their workplace, do not get time to hit the gym or play games.
Firstly, it is the organization’s duty to ensure that their employees are mentally and physically stable. The companies should provide their employees with free time to exercise as it can help them energize themselves. The employees should also be provided with free/subsidized gym membership in gyms which are closer to their homes. The government and private organizations can team-up to offer customized diet plans to their employees. In addition’ office canteens must ban the supply of soft drinks and junk food.
In conclusion, lack of physical exercise can lead to several health-related complications amongst employees. The government and private organizations must work together to help ensure that their employees get enough time to exercise and avoid regular/ excessive consumption of junk food.",8,many-working-people-get-little-or-no-exercise-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
470,"Nowadays, international tourism is the biggest industry in the world. Unfortunately, international tourism creates tension rather than understanding between people from different cultures. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","International tourism is one of the biggest industries contributing towards the economic growth of a country. It does create some conflicts between locals and visitors but these are not complicated issues and hence I do not agree with the argument that it creates more tension than understanding.
International tourism creates some worries because there is a cultural difference between the tourists and the locals. The tourists who visit foreign countries are not completely aware of the culture and the traditions of that country, because of which they are misunderstood for their activities by the natives. As a result, the locals sometimes take offence leading to conflicts and misunderstandings between them and the visitors. For instance, locals in Tirupati caught a foreign tourist, who tried to enter the temple with a bottle of beer. Later the tourist was informed of the religious significance of that temple.
On the bright side, international tourism plays a major role in promoting global peace and understanding. When people visit other countries, they learn to respect their culture and way of life. This facilitates better relationship between countries.
As for the conflicts, they can be resolved easily. Both the locals and the tourist should be aware of the cultural differences and the locals cannot expect the foreigners to know everything about the tradition of the place they are visiting. Furthermore, locals should not get into conflicts with tourists; rather they should make the tourists understand the traditional values and the ethics. Similarly, foreigners should give respect and cooperate with the local people in order to avoid any unnecessary conflicts. The government of both the countries should educate the people to understand the cultural difference and how to deal with such issues.
In conclusion, though some conflicts may arise due to the growing popularity of international tourism, in my opinion, it is largely a positive trend and needs to be promoted. The minor issues that could arise can be sorted out with a little effort.",8,international-tourism-creates-tension-rather-than-understanding-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
471,"Art is considered an essential part of all cultures throughout the world. However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology and business. Why do you think that is?
What could be done to encourage more people to take interest in the arts?","Though art has always been an intrinsic part of all cultures, its appreciation has been diminishing in recent times. This essay will analyze the reasons for this trend and also articulate steps needed to motivate people to appreciate art.
A variety of factors has contributed to the decline of interest in art. Firstly, the holistic value of art is not widely understood as most people view art as either luxurious indulgence or unproductive hobby of those who do not have aptitude for science or business. The fact that art is an innately creative discipline that helps both understand and propagate subjects such as history, culture and sociology is seldom understood. Hence people do not spend time and money to savour art, be it by buying paintings or viewing theatre performances. Secondly, as a consequence of the above point funding for art has depreciated thereby triggering the vicious cycle of diminishing supply-demand. Lastly, art as a career option is not a mass employment category and hence it does not get the visibility needed to attract aspirants.
Given this, it is imperative that steps are taken to reverse this trend. The principal action to be taken is to build awareness about art in the wider society. A sustained omni-channel campaign across traditional and digital media educating people on the not-so-apparent value of art will produce salutary effects. Furthermore, art should be introduced in schools in a wide range of mandatory and optional modules and this will both pique curiosity and inculcate interest in children. Lastly, the government should sponsor art events as part of various promotional programmes to seduce people to get a taste of art.
In conclusion, with concerted efforts along the lines outlined above, interest in art can be generated and sustained. An enhanced appreciation will sustain the ecosystem of patronage, supply and scholarship.",8,fewer-and-fewer-people-appreciate-art-now-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
472,Some people think that intelligence is innate while others think that we can improve our intelligence through learning. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"While a section of people opine that intelligence is an inborn talent/trait, another section consider it as a function of learning. This essay will discuss the views of both camps and also provide my own perspective.
Proponents of the “intelligence is innate” theory often cite the phenomenon of children producing different learning outcomes in schools despite having the same inputs, as a principal argument. They further argue that apart from the variation in children’s performance in specific subjects there is also wide variation in their orientation towards different disciplines. For instance, some children show natural aptitude for art, a few others pick up math easily and some show keenness for history. Another aspect highlighted by this camp is that only a few people emerge as renowned scientists or scholars even though lot of people put in concerted efforts towards getting such accomplishments.
On the other hand, people propounding the “intelligence can be enhanced” school of thought, do have certain supporting arguments. They claim that the mere fact that our acumen improves over our life time proves / vindicates their belief. Furthermore, they argue that environment and inputs are critical for the development of knowledge or skills and that these two factors are available at different levels to different people. Consequently, the intellectual outcomes are as well different.
To conclude, in my opinion, both sides of the argument hold water. But neither side can sufficiently explain the scheme of things in this world. Interestingly, a discerning melange of both the schools of thought provides a rational outlook. Each one of us is born with intelligence that is quantitatively and qualitatively different from the other. However, this aptitude is not static but evolves continuously over time based on environment, tools available and attitude that one develops towards learning.",8,some-people-think-that-intelligence-is-innate-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
473,"Some People think that the government should be responsible for crime prevention, while others believe that it is the responsibility of the individual to protect themselves. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","While some people are of the view that curbing criminal activities is the sole responsibility of the government, others opine that each person is responsible for their safety and protection. In my opinion, the government has a greater responsibility to keep criminal activities in check by enforcing stricter laws. Having said that, citizens also need to do whatever they can to ensure their safety.
On the one hand, some people feel that everyone of us should take care of our safety as police cannot be present everywhere at all times and this is true. For instance, thefts could occur in shops. The police cannot be present there all the time to prevent such incidents. Hence, it is the responsibility of the shop owners to take preventive measures such as installing an alarm or placing guards outside the shop. Customers also need to take care of their belongings to ensure that they are not robbed. Such measures can prevent many criminal acts from occurring. Thus, it is evident that each individual has a responsibility to ensure their safety.
On the other hand, there is a limit to what a person can do on their own. Only governments can enforce strict laws to keep the crime rate in check. Stringent laws will act as a deterrent and reduce the crime rate to a great extent. For example, in the Middle East (write: the Middle East) the punishments for each and every crime are so harsh that people do not dare to break any laws; as a result the crime rate in the Middle Eastern countries is the lowest in the world whereas in India the crime rate keeps on rising year after year because the laws are lenient and more often than not the criminals are let off very easily. Unfortunately, this encourages others to commit crime. Hence, the state has to own up the responsibility and enforce stern laws that will discourage people from committing crimes.
In conclusion, both the individuals and the government have the responsibility to prevent crime from occurring. The government should enact stringent laws to deter people from committing crimes. At the same time, people should also do whatever they can to ensure their safety.",8,some-people-think-that-the-government-is-responsible-for-crime-prevention-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
474,Many people nowadays travel abroad for their university education. Why do people do this and would/will you consider doing this yourself?,"Nowadays, studying abroad has become a trend. Over the years, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of people going abroad for higher studies. Studying abroad is an effective way to get a college degree and travel the world at the same time. This essay will explore the reasons that encourage people to study abroad.
A foreign degree has tremendous value. Students who have a degree from a well-known international university can easily find a coveted job. This is the main reason that encourages many students to pursue higher studies in a foreign country. In addition, people get to learn many things when they move to a new country. First, they will get an opportunity to get introduced to a new culture and heritage. This exposure will enhance their world view and make them more tolerant of differences.
Another advantage of studying abroad is the opportunity to learn or a perfect a second or third language. For example, Indian students who study in the US or Australia get an opportunity to perfect their English language skills. Although English is widely taught in India, many students acquire proficiency in the language only after moving to a foreign country. Moving abroad for higher studies also enables students to live independently. When they live alone in a foreign country away from their parents they learn a lot of life skills that will stand them in good stead. Considering these benefits I will definitely accept an opportunity to study abroad.
In the end I would like to conclude by saying that living and studying in a new country expands our horizon and enhances our career prospects. Hence, in my opinion, if we receive an opportunity to study abroad, we must seize it without any hesitation.",8,many-people-nowadays-travel-abroad-for-their-university-education-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
475,Many people argue that free public transportation should be available in most major cities. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this idea?,"According to some people, the government should offer free public transportation in big cities. In my opinion, this could be advantageous for some sections of the society but it will be a liability for the government.
If public transport is available in cities, few people will want to use their own vehicle. This will definitely reduce the traffic congestion in urban areas. Better still, we may see an increase in air quality because fewer vehicles on the road means less emission. In addition, the free transport option will be a boon for the low and middle class people. Transport options in major cities are pretty expensive right now. If the government makes them available free of cost, the commuters will definitely benefit.
On the other hand, public transport is currently an important source of revenue for the government. If it is made free the government will find it rather difficult to sustain it. This, in turn, will affect the quality and reliability of the service provided. In addition, in order to run a service that does not generate any money, the government will have to secure funds from elsewhere. In most cases, this will be done at the expense of other sectors. In other words, the free public transport services will force the government to spend less on other sectors like healthcare, education or infrastructure. The other option for the government is to increase taxes. In either case, a measure like this will have an adverse effect on the people and the economy in the long run.
To conclude, after analysing the advantages and disadvantages of offering free public transport, it is easy to see that this is not a viable option. Hence, rather than investing in public transport, the government should spend money for improving the existing infrastructure and transport networks. This will solve most of the traffic woes plaguing big cities.",8,many-people-argue-that-free-public-transportation-should-be-available-in-major-cities-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
476,"Some shops are open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Do you think it is a good thing for the customer, the shop staff and the company as a whole?","These days, many stores serve people round the clock. In my opinion, this is a positive development which provides a plethora of benefits to the customers, the workforce and the businesses themselves. This essay will discuss the positive aspects of this approach in detail.
To begin with, there are many compelling reasons to believe that 247 retail stores provide many benefits. Primarily, people can get food and other essential items whenever they want. This makes their lifestyle better and healthier because many food outlets offer healthy and scrumptious meals at the same price throughout the day. This is a blessing for busy professionals who often work odd hours. Gone are the days when people worked during the day and slept at night. Now, thanks to globalization many business establishments work round the clock. When retail stores also remain open 24 hours a day 7 days a week, they can serve people working in night shifts better.
Employment generation is another benefit of this development. When stores work 247, they need more staff. This creates employment opportunities for many people. Staff can also work overtime and earn higher salaries. Businesses also benefit a lot. By serving customers round the clock, they are able to generate higher revenues. Studies have shown that outlets that are open throughout the day and night have higher profits than outlets that serve customers only during the day.
To conclude, when shops remain open throughout the day, they benefit the community, the workers and the businesses. Hence, in my opinion, this trend is largely positive.",8,shops-are-open-24-hours-a-day-7-hours-a-week-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
477,"Although many people value their public parks, this space could be for other purposes such as residential areas for the ever growing population or to develop business and boost economies. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","According to some people the land occupied by public parks could be used for building houses and business establishments. I fully agree with the idea of building houses and office blocks in such areas in order to meet the needs of the growing population and to increase the economic growth.
Since the population of the world is growing at a faster rate than ever before, many countries are facing serious problems of housing crises. As a result of population growth, an increasingly large number of people are becoming homeless. Those who are living in high rise buildings tend to have high health and safety risks due to inadequate space and poor living conditions. For instance, Grenfell Tower fire incident can be seen as an example of fire risk in such buildings. Therefore, the argument that the land of parks and open spaces could be better used for building housing for the homeless certainly holds water.
Similarly office workers face problems due to inadequate space in the workplaces. This really affects the productivity and the resulting profits of businesses. Building new developments in open spaces will provide opportunities not only for the new businesses but also for the existing ones. For instance, a recent research revealed that inadequate space in offices declines the performance of employees and projects by 10%. Hence new business establishments will lead to better economic conditions and prosperity for the countries.
n conclusion, construction of new buildings and houses in the areas of parks is highly beneficial because it can tackle the issue of housing crises and accelerate economic growth.",8,public-parks-could-be-used-for-building-residential-areas-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
478,"In some countries it is thought advisable that children begin formal education at four years old, while in others they do not have to start school until they are seven or eight. How far do you agree with either of these views?","In many countries, it is recommended that children should start school education from the age of four. However, in some other parts of the world, formal education starts when a child reaches seven or eight years of age. In my opinion, starting school early is better for the overall development of the child.
While it is true that children who start school at age seven or eight get to spend more time with their parents, this practice does not always benefit their overall development. The first five years in the life of a child are the most crucial for his brain development. At home the child will be in the care of his parents or grandparents and they may not always be in a position to impart knowledge to him. While many parents do not have the skills or knowledge required to satisfy the curiosity of a toddler, those who can actually do so are usually busy at work. As a result, the child does not gain much from the time spent at home or in a day care centre.
By contrast, there are many benefits to starting school early. During early years, children tend to have outstanding learning capabilities. They can learn from both parents and teachers because their minds are highly impressionable and they can learn at a faster pace. Parents can help the learning process by providing children with a nurturing environment at home and teachers can teach them formal subjects such as mathematics, science and language. Better still, the school is a microcosm of the world. Here the children get to interact with their peers, elders and teachers and this knowledge will help them to grow into well-disciplined, good mannered adults. For instance, a recent research in London showed that children who started formal education at an early age had better cognitive abilities and outperformed their counterparts even in adolescence.
To conclude, the concept of starting formal education late is preposterous. Starting school education in early years is highly beneficial for a child because it boosts his personal as well as intellectual growth.

479,In some countries the average weight of people is increasing and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing. What do you think are the causes of these problems and what measures could be taken to solve them?,"A growing number of people are becoming obese in many countries around the world and their levels of well-being and fitness are reducing considerably. There can be various reasons for this problem and certain measures can be taken to address them.
One of the main reasons for rising obesity levels is that many people have sedentary lifestyles with poor dietary habits and lack of exercise. In other words, a large number of people are obsessed with fast food and ready to eat meals rich in calories. These foods have high contents of not only salt and sugar but also saturated fats. Taking these foods in excessive amounts can lead to gaining weight. For instance, a recent survey showed that in England around 70% of obese people either eat in fast food restaurants or get takeaways.
Similarly lack of exercise is another cause of increasing obesity. A majority of people spend their time sitting in offices in front of computer screens and they do not have enough time to do any kind of exercise. As a result, they put on weight. For instance, statistics revealed that only 20% of office workers do some physical activity on a regular basis in Birmingham.
This problem can be solved by educating people about the risks associated with weight gain. Making people more aware of massive health problems that can arise from poor diet can make a significant difference. Also, this issue can be addressed by incorporating more exercise into our daily schedule. If people eat a balance diet and exercise often, the resulting health issues of obesity can be managed.
In conclusion, although obesity levels are on the rise due to inadequate dietary habits/patterns and sedentary lifestyle, they can be tackled by making some simple changes to our lifestyle. Eating a well-balanced diet as well as exercising more often can help address this issue.",8,the-average-weight-of-people-is-increasing-and-their-level-of-fitness-is-decreasing-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
480,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, we are constantly being bombarded with commercials that tempt us to buy different products and services. It is true to a certain extent that the sales of consumer goods depend upon the amount of money that manufacturers invest in their marketing. Even so, I cannot fully agree with the given argument because in my opinion the majority of purchase decisions are not influenced by advertisements.
Advertising agencies promote their products by using famous people and social influencers in their commercials. Celebrity advertisements convince the buyer that they can achieve a better lifestyle or higher social status by using the advertised products. That is why many branded items such as designer clothes, perfumes and jewelry are high in demand in spite of their ridiculously higher prices compared to their actual value. In addition to this, in case of technology gadgets such as mobile phones, many people do not think twice before buying newer and updated versions in order to stay up to date with the latest technology although the one they own is still functioning well.
On the other hand, not every purchase decision is made under the influence of advertisements. Advertisements serve to inform customers about the goods and the available options in the market. People consider different things such as their budget range, their needs and the quality of the item they are buying before they make a purchase. Best selling products usually have a feature that serves to fulfill the buyer’s requirement. A new mobile phone, for example, may have more advanced technology that makes the user’s life more convenient. Moreover, a brand cannot maintain its popularity and reputation unless its quality lives up to customers’ expectations no matter how prolifically they advertise.
In conclusion, while I believe advertisements sometimes encourage people to buy unnecessary items, most of the best selling products are the ones that meet consumer’s needs, expectations and affordability.",8,the-high-sales-of-popular-consumer-goods-reflect-the-power-of-advertising-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
481,Some people think that success is the best measure of intelligence whilst others think that intelligent can be measured in other ways. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often thought that success indicates the intelligence of a person. However, others believe that intelligence can be tested through other methods. In my opinion, success is not the indicator of intelligence.
There are other factors which can lead to success such as the ability to cope with challenges and to learn from mistakes. It is often seen that resilient people tend to be more successful whether they are intelligent or not. This is because such people adapt to different circumstances. Even if they fail, they bounce back and eventually succeed. For example, 90% of successful entrepreneurs who participated in a recent survey in London said that they achieved their success by being adaptable. Another factor that determines the success of an individual is his hard work and determination. Successful people are often diligent and consistent in their efforts. For example, scientists owe their discoveries to their hard work. If scientists did not make constant efforts, they would not come up with achievements.
As for measuring the intelligence of a person, various tests are available. Formal exams in schools and IQ tests help determine the intelligence level of a person. It is not necessary that those who perform better in these tests tend to be successful in their careers. For instance, many top performing outstanding students of medical schools do not necessarily turn out to be successful doctors in medical practice.
In conclusion, success of a person is the indicator of his hard work and resilience and not intelligence. In my opinion, being intelligent is not sufficient to be successful. It is the combination of a number of factors such as hard work, determination and diligence that lead to success.",8,some-people-think-that-success-is-the-best-measure-of-intelligence-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
482,Research indicates that the characteristics we are born with have much more influence on our personality and development than any lifetime experiences. Which do you consider to be the major influence?,"In the present world, science has progressed a lot. Many studies are done on genes and chromosomes to identify human traits. Nowadays it is a debatable matter whether an individual’s personality is acquired genetically or developed by the experiences offered by life. In my opinion, lifetime experiences play a greater role than genes in a person’s development.
Inherent traits certainly influence a child. Everyone is born with certain hereditary characteristics. The genes transmit information from generation to generation and they do play a role in shaping the personality and appearance of the child. For example, a child born to dwarf couples will also be a dwarf. Similarly, emotions and behaviour like anger and sensitivity are innate and they have an impact on a person’s development.
However, lifetime experiences have a greater influence on the personality of an individual. A person learns a lot from his environment and these experiences often change him. For instance, I was an introvert as a child. But as I moved into a hostel in my teenage I was transformed into a more sociable person. This was because the hostel life required more interaction with others. Therefore, I believe that the innate characteristics can be altered as required by the surrounding environment. Moreover, the progress of an individual depends upon his own hard work and dedication. The child of a successful doctor need not be as successful as his father. Hence the life of an individual has a positive and negative effect on his personality and development.
In conclusion, the inborn characteristics have some influence on an individual’s personality and development. However, in my opinion, it is mainly the outlook and appearance that are acquired, and not the personality. The lifetime situations have a major influence on our ability to cope with our circumstances and succeed in life.",8,research-indicates-that-the-characteristics-we-are-born-with-have-more-influence-on-our-personality
483,"To solve the ever-increasing environmental hazards throughout the world, the best way is to increase the price of fuel. What is your opinion on the above assumption?","Since the last decade, environmental hazards have been a highly debated topic across the world. Many people believe that raising the cost of fuel is the best solution to decrease threats posed to our surroundings. I am of the opinion that this approach is effective but not the best one. During the course of the essay, I shall support my stand with valid arguments.
Elevating the price of fuel would undoubtedly decrease its consumption and thus reduce the hazards caused by it. However, vehicular pollution is not the only threat to our environment today.
Many factors affect our environment. Excessive use of personal vehicles is just one of them. Air pollution is also caused by the burning of household and industrial waste. In Delhi, for example, the main cause of air pollution is the burning of crop residues by farmers in Punjab and Haryana. Thus, it is evident that raising the price of fuel is not the right solution to dealing with all sorts of environmental problems.
Moreover, the rise in fuel prices can have a negative impact on everyone’s daily routine if alternatives are not provided. In the past, whenever the authorities increased the cost of fuel, there have been numerous instances of strikes and violence throughout the world. If the prices are to be raised, the citizens should be provided with free or cheap public transport. Additionally, the government can decrease the tax on electric vehicles.
To conclude, escalating the price of fuel could help decrease environmental hazards, but can also lead to other problems. Governments and environmentalists have to consider implementing multiple solutions together. Additionally, to cope with the downsides of such measures, appropriate alternatives have to be provided to the citizens.",8,to-solve-the-ever-increasing-environmental-hazards-the-best-way-is-to-increase-the-price-of-fuel-band-8-ielts-essay-sample

Criminal activities have shown growth in most parts of the world. There are several reasons but in my opinion two major reasons are lack of formal education and unemployment and they are related to each other.
A recent study shows that crime rate has declined by approximately 30% in those countries where better employment opportunities are available like South Korea, UAE and Qatar. To succeed in creating better job opportunities the government should introduce right policies and implement them without any discrimination. For instance, the UAE has introduced a new system that makes it easy to start your own business and have strict labor law to protect employee rights which ultimately helps to divert young people from any kind of criminal activities.
Another solution which can play an important role in preventing people especially youngsters from indulging in any kind of illegal activities is formal education. China is the right example for that. Recently Tim Cook CEO of Apple Corporation said in his interview that China holds the biggest pool of skilled labor than any other country. This was only possible through introducing free formal technical education policy to their young people and providing onsite experience at the same time. People can also play an important role in reduction of crime rate by being more vigilant and responsible in their neighborhood.
To conclude, lack of education and employment opportunities are the main reasons for the increase in the crime rate. By providing vocational education for free or at affordable rates and by creating more employment opportunities the government can address this problem to a great extent.",8,in-many-countries-the-amount-of-crime-is-increasing-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
485,Some people believe it is important to give gifts and presents to friends and family to show that we care for them. Others think that there are better ways to show affection to them. Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.,"Undoubtedly, there are different ways of showing our love to the people around us. Although some people think that giving gifts and presents is a better way to show our affection for our near and dear ones, others opine that there are other effective methods to show that we care and I agree with this. In this essay I shall discuss the different views of the people and also give my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.
Some people think that it is imperative to give gifts and presents to friends and family to show the affection. This is because these things are tangible which persistently reminds them that there is someone who cares for them. To illustrate, people living overseas usually give ornaments and other expensive items to family members to show their love. The argument is that since they are miles apart nothing can prove their love as well as these gifts.
Conversely, there are various ways other than gifting to show love. For example, in some Indian families the daughter-in-law shows her caring nature by serving her in-laws and looking after them. Likewise, the son-in-law may provide for his wife’s parents. As a result, the family bonding increases and a healthy relationship is built. Such kind and selfless deeds create joy in the family.
In my opinion, expensive items are not always necessary to reveal the affection. The other methods such as, spending precious time with dear ones and taking care of them physically and emotionally play a significant role in showing love.
In conclusion, though gifts sometimes serve as a means to show our caring nature especially in long distance relationships these things are short lived; instead sharing quality time with friends and family and assisting them whenever they need help can be a better way to show that we care.",8,some-people-believe-it-is-important-to-give-gifts-and-presents-to-friends-and-family-to-show-that-we-care-for-them-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
486,"Nowadays, the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?","Recent technological innovations have affected the way people communicate with each other. These technological tools have been proved to be extremely useful for families living abroad as well as businesses. Even though these are a few drawbacks associated with the use of technology, this is largely a positive development.
It is much easier these days to get in touch with the family members who live abroad. This was not the case in the past. For instance, these days Skype and Facebook are used to make calls to family or friends overseas and this has made life convenient and hassle free. In the past, people used to write letters and had to wait for a long time for them to be delivered. So, the technological gadgets such as smart phones and the internet help save one’s precious time. Also, these technological advances have helped businesses flourish by allowing / enabling employees to stay connected with one another. For example, emails can be sent to the colleagues and this helps boost productivity as time is not wasted on unnecessary tasks. All this has revolutionized the business sector.
On the flip side, there are a few negative aspects related to the use of technology. For instance, the practice of making relationships or friendships online is fraught with dangers because people often assume fake identities and hide facts about themselves. Teenagers are often affected by this negative trend. For instance statistics reveal that around 8% of people hide their actual identities on Facebook. Since there is no face to face interaction, it can lead to potentially dangerous outcomes.
To conclude, technology has definitely made it easier for people and businesses to communicate with one another. Whether it is good or bad depends upon how we use it. It is recommended that people exercise caution when they make relationships online.",8,nowadays-the-way-people-interact-with-each-other-has-changed-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
487,Some people say that it is possible to tell a lot about a person’s culture and character from their choice of clothes. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people argue that we can make realistic assumptions about a person’s character or personality from their style of clothing. I do not agree with this view because in my opinion clothes do not reveal much about a person values or attitude towards life.
Judging someone on the basis of their clothes essentially shows our narrow mindedness. It reflects limitations of mind with respect to what they perceive to be an ideal way. Traditions and cultures are deep-rooted and are passed down through generations. They are further strengthened by family values and just because someone chooses to dress differently, they cannot have a different set of values.
What’s more, instance, some highly accomplished people are actually very humble and dress modestly some non-achievers may dress gaudily with the sole objective of grabbing attention. Einstein, for example, was never concerned about his appearance but he was one of the most respected and famous persons of the last century. His style of clothing gave hardly any clues about his integrity or character. Likewise, Muslim women wear Burkha as a mark of respect towards their religion and beliefs, and it states nothing about their character or nature. In my opinion, a person’s lifestyle, preferences and habits give more clues regarding their temperament and character than their choice of clothing. Take the life of Mahatma Gandhi, for example. He lived a life full of passion and purpose and he was much admired for his right conduct and honesty. He used to wear loin clothes, but he possessed great virtues unknown to many. Thus, it is evident that there is little we can deduce from their choice of clothes.
In my conclusion, a person’s clothing or general appearance cannot be used as a parameter to judge their personality. At the most / at the best clothes can make you look modern or conservative. They don’t give any other indication about your values or culture.",8,some-people-say-it-is-possible-to-tell-a-lot-about-a-persons-character-from-their-choice-of-clothes-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
488,Smacking children is the best form of discipline. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that corporal punishment works better for children. These people claim that physical punishment is the most efficient way to teach discipline to youngsters. This essay will argue why beating children is never the right way to instil discipline in them.
A few parents are overly concerned about disciplining their children. They insist that smacking will develop fear in the mind of the children and help them to keep them under control. However, this argument does not much water. Smacking might help in the short turn, but parents who regularly beat their children will eventually lose their support. Hence the idea that smacking is extremely important for discipline is completely preposterous.
Smacking children directly affects their brain and in the long run makes them rebellious. Furthermore, instead of forcing discipline on them, parents should teach it in a polite way. Studies have also shown that children who learn discipline on their own are less likely to waver from the right path even when they are tempted to do so. By contrast, those who learned discipline for fear of punishment will willingly choose the right path if they get a chance. Overall, the idea that smacking children is vital is ill-informed and dangerous in itself and could potentially lead to a far worse outcome for the society.
In conclusion, this essay argued that people who are in favour of spanking punishment have a flawed understanding of punishment and they are wrongly linking it to discipline. In my opinion, smacking a child the name of discipline is completely unacceptable. There are various other ways to teach discipline to youth.",8,smacking-children-is-the-best-form-of-discipline-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
489,Teenage offenders should be treated in the same way as adult criminals. Do you agree?,"Some people advocate that criminals ought to be punished using the same yardstick irrespective of their age. Though I understand the rationale behind this argument, in my opinion, the implementation of this idea may have adverse consequences. Therefore, adolescent crimes should be dealt with more sensitivity.
If teenagers received the same punishment as adults, at least some of them would think twice before committing a crime. In a sense, this will reduce the juvenile crime rate. However, we must not overlook the fact that most crimes are not premeditated. They are committed on the spur of the moment. The teenage brain and highly volatile and immature and it may fail to fully comprehend the consequences of an action. As a result, teenagers commit many crimes that they will eventually regret when they become adults. By giving them the same punishment that an adult would get, the society is depriving them of an opportunity to repent their action and reform themselves.
Nevertheless, there is no justification for the crime. However, teenagers must be punished with an alternative mindset as punishing them like adults could cause an irreparable damage to the personality, behavior and attitude towards life. They may completely lose hope and purpose, especially since they are yet to start life and this may turn them into rebels. Therefore, juvenile punishments should be of shorter durations and less severity. This should be followed by mandatory long term intensive rehabilitation and counseling programs. Furthermore, programs comprising of vocational courses should be essentially introduced to guide them. They can later utilize this to earn their living as well. In addition, they should be compulsorily enrolled into supervised community service programs so that they can learn values such as empathy.
To conclude, I emphasize that there is no excuse for any crime. All defaulters must be punished with no exception. However, a sensitive issue such as teenage crime needs to be dealt with in a mature way. Equating them with adult offenders is definitely not the answer. Like it is well said, finish the crime and not the criminals.",8,teenage-offenders-should-be-treated-in-the-same-as-adult-criminals-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
490,"There are too many people on this planet, so it is logical to look for other planets to colonise. Is the colonisation of space the answer to overpopulation?","Undoubtedly, there has been a population explosion over the past few decades and the bomb continues to tick. Some people think that; use the active voice inhabiting another planet is a rational approach in order to deal with this problem. In my opinion, there are better plausible solutions to handle overpopulation.
Admittedly, scientists have always been curious about / intrigued by the possibility of life on a different planet other than earth. However, the consequences of permanently making another planet one’s abode should be scrutinized from various angles. Firstly, long term effects on human beings are unknown yet which could possibly be disastrous. For example, uncontrolled exposure to several existing harmful radiations in space could lead to multiple health issues later. Secondly, the impact on the environment of the new planet could be disheartening in due course. As it is, environmental issues on earth are quite overwhelming. Depletion of resources, deforestation, soil erosion, air pollution and extinction of several species are just some of the consequences of human activity on the planet. Lastly, the geopolitical complications should also be pondered upon. In the present scenario we are only dealing with issues between countries but in future there could be wars between planets. This once again would be catastrophic for human race.
As far as solutions to overpopulation are concerned, the foremost step is to educate people. Sensitizing people about the adverse impact of uncontrolled population growth is mandatory. As per WHO, the rate of population growth is inversely proportional to the level of literacy. This is more relevant to the developing and underdeveloped nations. Secondly, the government should enforce stringent laws to curb population growth. For example, it should enforce the two child norm, provide incentives to small families and withdraw certain perks to families that have more than two children. China, for instance, is a brilliant example where one child norm was followed diligently for a period of time.
To conclude, exploring space to discover a life on another planet may serve a greater purpose and should definitely be pursued but not as a solution to overpopulation. However, overpopulation is a matter of serious concern. Therefore, it must be controlled as early as possible using all our wisdom and more importantly by taking a collective responsibility.",8,there-are-too-many-people-on-this-planet-so-it-is-logical-to-look-for-other-planets-to-colonise-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
491,"Although more and more people read news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In recent years, digitization has become an integral part of our life, and it has impacted almost every aspect of our life including our reading habits. While an increasing number of people prefer to read online news, it has been argued that newspapers will remain the main source of news and information. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, reading newspapers is a force of habit and in future people will move to digital news.
There are many benefits to reading news on the internet. The most important benefit of online news is that it is up-to-date and convenient to read. Traditional newspapers get updated only once a day but their online versions are updated almost every hour. Also finding information online is easy because one can easily search any topic by entering the keywords and read instant updates.  Secondly, reading digital news is easy and enjoyable because one does not have to turn pages like in a newspaper to find information.
In addition to this, digitized news can be accessed for free or at a minimal cost, whereas physical newspapers are costlier than their digital versions. For instance, the monthly subscription fee of most newspapers is more than Rs. 200, which makes them at least 85-90% costlier than e-newspapers. Last but not least, people around the globe understood the impact newspapers have on the environment, whereas digital news does not require any paper or ink to publish. Hence, it is considered as eco-friendly.
In conclusion, people are fond of reading traditional newspapers. However, considering the advantages of digital news, I firmly believe that people will leave their habit, and switch to digital news, which will become the primary source of information in the near future.",8,although-more-people-read-news-on-the-internet-newspapers-will-remain-the-most-important-source-of-news-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
492,Many old buildings protected by law are part of nation’s history. Some people think they should be knocked down and replaced by news ones. How important is it to maintain old buildings? Should history stand in the way of progress? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.,"Almost every country in the world has one or more historical buildings, which are protected by the regulations of the law. While some people argue that these buildings should be demolished and replaced with new buildings for the growth of the nation, I believe that they should be maintained because they are not a hurdle in the path to economic growth. Rather they are a source of revenue and knowledge.
Heritage buildings play a significant role in enhancing our knowledge about the historical events occurred in the country. This is because many of these constructions are related to either revolutions recorded in history or the way our ancestors used to live their life. By teaching about these buildings, teachers can instil in their students a sense of patriotism and pride in their heritage. For instance, the Gandhi Ashram at Ahmedabad played a vital role in our freedom struggle against the British. When people visit this Ashram, they will learn more about India’s struggle for independence and appreciate the value of freedom.
On the other hand, there is an argument that old buildings are obstacles in the progress of the country as they do not fit into the plan of modern cities. However, as per the data published by UNESCO, tourism is one of the booming industries and historical buildings are one of the most visited places in the world. Hence, many governments are promoting these historical places to attract tourists from foreign countries. For example, the campaign Incredible India features historical buildings like Taj Mahal and Red Fort in their promotions, as these buildings are some of the most attractive tourist destinations. Hence, by promoting these monuments, authorities can increase the influx of tourists and thus earn valuable foreign exchange.
In conclusion, despite the argument that historical buildings should make way for new constructions, I firmly believe that these could come at the cost of destroying our history and heritage. Hence, in my opinion, these buildings need to be protected as they represent our heritage and earn revenue for the government.",8,some-people-think-that-old-buildings-should-be-knocked-down-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
493,"Children are facing more pressures nowadays from academic, social and commercial perspectives. What are the causes of these pressures and what measures should be taken to reduce these pressures?","It is often said that today’s children are facing more pressures from academic, social and commercial perspectives. This essay intends to discuss the causes of these pressures and the measures to alleviate the same.
A common belief is that children of today’s society are facing huge academic pressures. Their competition is not with the children sitting next to them or in the next class. It is at national and international levels. Parents have high expectations for their child. They want them to excel in every field. Every parent wants their child to go to the best school of their city. These days, the school bag is heavier than the student himself. Moreover, considering the standards of education and competition today, after the school, they have to go to private coaching too. Thus they are left with no time to relax or engage in enjoyable outdoor activities.
Then comes the social and commercial pressures on children today. The situation becomes perilous when children want to adopt the global culture despite the fact that their parents want them to stay rooted in their own culture. This in turn leads the children to rebel against the rules laid down by their respective family. In addition to this the commercial pressures have a major impact on the minds of today’s children. It stresses them out when they cannot compete with their peers in terms of material possessions. For example, a child will undoubtedly want a mobile phone that is as good or even better than that of his friend.
To sum up, we cannot deny that today’s children are facing more pressures from academic, social and commercial perspectives. However, to avoid the same, Parents should have realistic expectations from their child. And most importantly they should spend adequate time with their children. The greatest onus is on the schools and teachers. They should not teach to win at all cost. They should in fact make a student learn how to win with modesty and lose with grace. Both parents and schools should learn and allow children to bloom by bringing out their hidden talent. It in turn will make a child grow physically and psychologically.",8,children-are-facing-more-pressures-nowadays-from-academic-social-and-commercial-perspectives-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
494,Many people believe that social networking sites (such as Facebook) have had a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extent do you agree?,"Social networking websites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have become an important part of our everyday life. However, it is argued that these sites have a devastating effect on the community and the individuals. I strongly agree with the thought that social websites have a profound negative effect.
To begin with, social networking sites have started hurting relationships. In the present world, people spend a lot of time online. Hence, they do not have time to visit their friends or relatives. As a result, relationships have become shallow. For example, in the earlier days, individuals used to have get-togethers at least once a month, but nowadays most of the people do not even know many of their relatives. Consequently, there are no close helpful relationships in this era.
Addiction is another drawback of social networks which leads to failure in almost every field. Most of the people waste hours in front of computers or mobile phones chatting and posting on Facebook and Twitter and thus they fail to pay attention to their work. For instance, students do not perform their best in the exams or fail because they spend more time online instead of studying. As a result, social networking sites hinder the progress of the individual and also of the society.
In conclusion, although Facebook and such sites are beneficial to some extent, I strongly agree with the argument that they have more detrimental effect on both the local community and the people. It is hoped that users will realize this and learn to use such platforms more judiciously.",8,many-people-believe-that-social-networking-sites-have-a-huge-negative-impact-on-both-individuals-and-society-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
495,"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes (for eg. working for a charity, improving a neighborhood or teaching sports to young children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Education plays a very important role in the lives of people. Some people are of the opinion that unpaid community services should be made compulsory for school students. In my opinion, the advantages of adding unpaid community service to the school curriculum outweigh the drawbacks, if any.
Children have very impressionable minds and school programs should be designed in such a way that they will ensure the overall development of the child. Dignity of labor is an essential topic that is covered in the school curriculum but it is better understood when children actually engage in various forms of labour. For example, when students are made to do community service like cleaning up a park every Friday, it instills in them respect for the person doing that job and also a greater awareness that littering is a bad habit.
Some people will argue that a child should not be put through these kinds of experiences as they should be made to aspire for greater things in life by working really hard in school. Moreover, they should spend more time studying. I believe if the importance of serving the society is instilled in the children from a very early age, they will grow up to become a much more socially aware and socially responsible person. For example, in Japanese education system, special emphasis is given to community service, though many people do not understand why it is necessary. However, the purpose of this became clear during the recently concluded football World Cup in Russia. Although the Japanese team lost the semi final match they won the hearts of many people by the service they provided by cleaning up the stands of a foreign country.
In conclusion, the advantages of mandatory community service in school outweigh any disadvantages associated with it. After studying the pros and cons, I am convinced that community service helps the overall development of the child and subsequently the nation.",8,some-people-believe-that-unpaid-community-service-should-be-a-compulsory-part-of-high-school-programmes-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
496,Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected personal relationships? Has this become a positive or negative development?,"Advancements in technology have changed the way we interact with one another. People often debate whether this development has any negative impact on relationships. In my opinion, although technology has some negative aspects, its impact on our lives has been largely positive. The most important benefit of advanced communication tools is that they enable us to receive instant replies from the other person.
Earlier, people had to wait for a longer time to get reply from the other person. However, with the advances of technology, an individual can communicate from any corner of the world without any interference or dependency on others. For example, the postman used to take days to deliver messages from sender to receiver because that message had to physically travel from its source to the destination. However, same message could be delivered instantly to the other person through digital applications like WhatsApp and Skype.
On the other hand, there is an argument that new age technologies have made people less sociable. They do not interact with their family members or neighbours because they are busy communicating with their virtual friends on Facebook or Twitter. This is certainly an alarming development. Even so, these applications help people to remain in contact with each other even if they are located in faraway places. Using services like Facebook or Instagram, we can keep ourselves updated about the happenings in the lives This is because these platforms provide all the updates about the individual events in life like birthday, hobbies and many others, and these offer an opportunity to the people to interact with one another. By contrast, this was not possible in earlier years, because as a human one cannot remember every aspect of others’ life. Hence, these technologies have brought people closer than before.
In conclusion, new communication tools have certainly made people less sociable; however, they also allow us to stay in constant touch with our near and dear ones wherever they may be. In my opinion, if these tools are used responsibly they are a boon to mankind.",8,nowadays-the-way-people-interact-with-each-other-has-changed-because-of-technology-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
497,Some people argue that higher taxes should be collected from industries causing higher industrial pollution. Whereas others argue there are better ways to deal. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Pollution has become a global problem and each nation is trying hard to deal with this problem. Amidst all these, a few people have come up with a viewpoint that the government should impose higher tax on industries as they are the major contributor of pollution. However, many people including me disagree with this suggestion as I think that there are numerous other ways to combat the effect of pollution. This essay will discuss the viewpoint of both the parties and will also present my opinion on the same.
To commence with, some people have a school of thought that industries cause high level of pollution by emitting harmful gases, discharging chemical waste into water bodies, and burning coal and petroleum. They are damaging the environment brutally. Hence, they should pay for their wrong deeds. I agree with the argument factories play an important role in creating environmental problems.
However, they are not solely responsible for the degrading condition of this planet. Each and every individual is contributing towards increasing pollution. Therefore, we all should take the responsibility of our negligence and work hard for the betterment of the nature. There are plenty of people who agree with my opinion that we should employ other methods of mitigating pollution rather than increase the taxes. Increase in taxes will not make industries realise their mistake. Rather, it will be easier for them to continue their disastrous activities after paying a small amount of fine. Hence, it will further increase the pollution to a great extent.
The government should formulate stringent rules for the protection of environment. Firstly, afforestation should be promoted. Secondly, the usage of unnecessary vehicles should be banned. Thirdly, wastage of water should be stopped and plans for conservation of water should be implemented. Fourthly, burning of coal, petroleum and plastic in the open air should be prohibited and strict punishment should be given to the offenders. Lastly, we as responsible citizens should work hard towards mending our ways by using renewable sources of energy and limiting our use of private vehicles.
To recapitulate, I would like to assert that there are better ways to deal with this issue rather than imposing taxes. All the individuals should work hard toward taking care of our planet as we are the main culprit. The government should also be more serious about environmental protection and enact stringent laws. By taking all of these measures we can certainly take care of environmental damage.",8,some-people-think-that-higher-taxes-should-be-collected-from-industries-causing-higher-industrial-pollution-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
498,The performance of staff can have a significant impact on the success of a company. What can companies do to increase staff productivity?,"Companies can earn huge amount of profit if they have hardworking staff. On the other hand, incompetent staff can totally ruin the prospects of a company. Hence, the performance of staff has a remarkable effect on the profitability of the company. This essay will highlight the importance of the performance of staff and will also suggest the ways to increase the output of the staff.
To commence with, I would like to say that the performance of staff can be beneficial for the company in many ways. If the staff is sincere toward their job and if they have full knowledge about their work then they will manage their work well. Also, if each member of the company works hard then the profit of the company will increase manifold.
For instance, if each staff member devotes extra time for the company, the productivity of the company will increase to a great extent. However, if the staff is careless or irresponsible, the profitability of the company will suffer. The quantity and the quality of work can suffer a lot because of the negligence of the workers.
It has been clearly stated in the aforementioned paragraph that it is vital for the company to have efficient workers. The companies can take several steps to increase the productivity of staff. Firstly, if the company rewards the good performance of the workers then they will get motivated and will work even hard to get the reward. Secondly, the company should take care of the requirements of the employees. They should be given adequate relaxation time and days off so that they can have quality time with their near and dear ones. Thirdly, motivational speakers can be hired to motivate the staff. Lastly, parties or excursions to the nearby places can be organized to help the workers get away from the monotony of life.
To recapitulate, I would like to assert that it is of paramount importance for the employers to take good care of the staff as it will be fruitful for the company in the long run. They can do this by instituting a reward system to motivate hardworking employees.",8,the-performance-of-staff-can-have-a-significant-impact-on-the-success-of-a-company-band-8-ielts-essay-sample-2
499,Some people say that supermarkets should have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging for products they sell. Others say it is the responsibility of the consumers to avoid such products. Discuss and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, there is a huge concern about the environment as people have started realising the negative impact of their actions on nature / on the planet. Plastic pollution is one of such issues / concerns which need to be dealt with quickly and effectively. According to some people, super markets should help to improve the situation by reducing the amount of packaging they use. Others insist that it is the duty of consumers to stay away from over packaged products. Both views will be discussed in this essay.
One the one hand, it is evident that supermarkets and manufacturers are the prime producers and promoters of the consumer goods ; therefore they are the roots of this problem and by applying simple regulations over the manufacturing process , they can decrease the amount of packaging efficiently. Take milk bottles, for example. If supermarkets made them thinner or even replaced them with carton bottles, they would have a tremendous impact on the amount of plastic consumed. Thus, the argument that supermarkets should take the responsibility to reduce over packaging certainly makes sense.
On the other hand, satisfying people’s demand is the main job of the manufacturer. This means that the more people continue to purchase packaged products, the more they are produced. By contract, if people decided to cut their consumption of such products, there would be a definite reduction in their production. For instance, two years ago the government in the UK imposed a price on plastic bags in large supermarkets. This action decreased their consumption as well as production. Thus, it is clear that consumers have a key role to play in tackling this issue.
In conclusion, I believe that collaborative efforts should be taken by both the manufacturers and the consumers in order to reduce pollution caused by excessive packaging.",8,some-people-say-supermarkets-have-the-responsibility-to-reduce-the-amount-of-packaging-for-products-they-sell-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
500,Some people think that new technologies benefit the life of workers whereas some deny the statement. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"The unprecedented developments in the field of science and technology have changed lives dramatically. While some people are of the opinion that technological advancements have improved the life of workers, others think that they have led to unexpected problems. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and express my opinion.
Initially when people were introduced to technology, they were told/ informed that the development was made for everyone’s betterment. However, the situation changed over the years and machines started replacing humans leading to unemployment.
Computers are a classic example of this situation because many people have lost their jobs with the invasion of computers. Furthermore, machines also reduced physical activity among their users which made them lethargic and prone to illnesses. People started looking for more convenient options and started depending on machines for easing their lives.
On the other hand, there have been some advancements too that proved to be a boon like the invention of emails. Emails changed the way business and commerce used to operate. With the day to day communication getting quicker and inexpensive, every industry adopted it. The only reason why globalisation was possible was due to email operations. For instance, as per a recent survey by “the Telegraph” newspaper, the introduction of emails in every sector helped foreign brands enter Indian market and expand.
To conclude, after discussing both sides of the argument in detail, it is not hard to say that advancement in technology has not proved to be advantageous for everyone. People have become more sluggish and lazier. In fact, some people have even lost their livelihood because of advances in technology.",8,some-people-think-that-new-technologies-benefit-the-life-of-workers-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
501,There is an increasing number of people using the credit card which seems likely to replace the coins and notes in the future. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?,"It is observed that the number of credit card users has increased rapidly in recent times. Therefore, it appears to many people that coins and paper money will be replaced by the plastic money in the foreseeable future. In my opinion, the merits and demerits of credit card usage are in the hand of users. In my opinion, the increase in the access to credit cards can be positive or negative depending upon how they are used.
To commence with, the prime benefit of using a credit card is that it provides financial back up in emergency cases such as a health scare and job loss. If an individual needs monetary support instantly then the credit card service is a huge relief to them because it provides money without any additional paperwork. For instance, during a medical treatment, if a patient has to go through urgent surgery which requires an exorbitant amount of money then the patient can pay the medical bills by using a credit card. Thus, it is obvious that credit card usage is a positive development.
On the contrary, credit card users are often in deficit due to overspending. As the credit card provides instant money to the cardholder, they can purchase products and avail of services which are out of their budget. Eventually, they may end up with a huge debt which needs to be paid on time; otherwise they will have to pay penalties for late payment. Thus, it is evident that credit cards do have a negative impact on people’s finances.
To conclude, a credit card is in demand because of its easy and convenient use. In my opinion, access to a credit card can be a positive development as long as one uses it responsibly.",8,an-increasing-number-of-people-use-the-credit-card-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
502,"Some people tell that to reduce the traffic and pollution, government should increase the tax on the petrol. Would there be more benefits than the drawback?","In the modern society, traffic and pollution have become a major problem. The government is coming up with various schemes to fight / tackle this menace; however, there is no solution yet. A few people are of the opinion that increasing the tax on petrol may help to improve the situation as this measure will help to reduce the number of vehicles and the resultant air pollution. In my opinion, this move will have more disadvantages than advantages.
Petrol plays a very important role when we count the factors that impact the economy. If the price of petrol increases, it will affect the price of other commodities as well. Commodities need to be transported from place to place and when the cost of transportation increases, essential items will become expensive making survival difficult for the common man. Also, when oil prices increase, the public transport will also become costlier. The poor sections of the society will be the worst hit by this measure because the hike in the price of petrol will not deter the rich from driving their own vehicle.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a drop in traffic will reduce air pollution. Automobiles are just one of the causes of pollution. There are various other factors such as wildfires, the burning of crop residues, and factories. Serious measures need to be taken to control them.
To conclude, after discussing the various factors contributing to pollution, it is not hard to say that petrol is not the only reason for all the problems. In my opinion, petrol prices should not be increased as this move will impact not only related sectors but also the entire economy. Worse, it is unlikely to deliver the intended result.",8,some-people-say-that-the-government-should-increase-the-tax-on-petrol-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
503,Some people believe that watching television is bad for children. Other people believe that watching television is educational for children. Which opinion do you agree with and why? Give specific details and examples in your answer.,"Some people believe that watching television is not good for children while there are many others who believe that television is informative and educational for children. I firmly agree with the latter statement but in my opinion parents should decide which shows their children should watch.
On the one hand, several lines of evidence suggest that television is informative and educational for children. To begin with, shows like world discovery broadcasted on television help children to learn about new inventions. Furthermore, watching programs is an informative way of entertainment for children. For example, my son absolutely loves watching programmes on National Geographic/Discovery/BBC Earth. Many of these programmes have even helped him with his school assignments. He is not really into reading, but these shows give him the knowledge and information he needs.
However, television can be informative and educational only when parents decide which shows their children should watch. There are many shows broadcasted on television which can be unsuitable for children. Firstly, there are some shows which are related to violence, drugs and sex. These shows spoil the mindset of children. Secondly, young children blindly follow some characters and learn violent attitude from them. For instance, in the recent past there were many reports about crimes committed by teenagers. Investigations revealed that many of them had the habit of watching violent shows on television. Inspired by these programmes they plotted crimes. This is a good example of the harmful impact of television programmes on children. Thus it goes without saying that parents can make television either destructive or constructive for children.
To conclude, although television programmes can be informative for children parents should help them choose the right programmes. If children are allowed to watch whatever they want, they may unwittingly choose shows that have a detrimental impact on them.",8,some-people-believe-that-watching-television-is-bad-for-children-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
504,Some psychologists recommend that it is important to overcome stress by spending time doing nothing. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"These days, the hectic lifestyle has increased the stress level among people. A few psychologists suggest that one of the ways to get rid of stress is to stay idle for some time. In my opinion, stress is preventing us from enjoying our happy moments and inviting acute diseases. I strongly agree with the argument that stealing some time from daily chores to give rest to your mind, helps in reducing the stress level.
To begin with, the brain, like any other human body part, needs time to repair the damaged tissues. The brain works in a manner similar to a machine. And if we overload it with numerous activities, then it will collapse at one stage. Therefore, we need to give it rest by taking some time-off. In a recent survey it was found that people who work more than 14 hours a day are 80% more likely to die in their 50s.
On the other hand, there are many benefits to doing nothing. By not engaging in any work, we can divert our mind towards good old memories. It releases good hormones in our body. These feel good hormones refresh our mind and provide extra energy. Also we can use this time to converse with the family members. It contributes to developing strong bond among family members. For example, studies have shown that people who spend a lot of time with their family have considerably reduced risk of developing cardiac problems.
In conclusion, stress is like a termite. It not only kills the present joy but also ruins future plans. Hence, it is not healthy to constantly focus on our life goals. An occasional break from these priorities will help to alleviate stress and bring peace to mind and life.",8,some-psychologists-recommend-that-it-is-important-to-overcome-stress-by-doing-nothing-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
505,Some people fail in school but end up being successful in life. Why do you think that is the case? What is the most important thing to succeed in life?,"Academic grade plays a pivotal role in building a successful career. Therefore, it is always advised that students should focus on their studies well. However, we have seen that many people who have become successful failed in their school exams. This essay will discuss the reasons behind this scenario and also highlight the factors crucial for achieving success in life.
To commence with, I would like to say that success and failure are part and parcel of life. Success surely gives us happiness but failure provides us determination and motivation to work hard the next time. This is one of the major reasons why children who fail in school work hard on their shortcomings.
Another point to consider is that many kids do not take their academics seriously during their young age. However, when they mature, their personality transforms completely. Furthermore, some students take interest in other fields like sports, art, music etc. Hence, they do not focus on their studies well. Lastly, I personally believe that there are a good proportion of people who do not like to simply cram for their exams. They become successful because of their creativity and their desire to do something different.
There are numerous factors which help to achieve success in life. Firstly, I believe that hard work is the key to success. We should work hard and have some patience and perseverance to obtain desired results. Secondly, our goal should be clear. If we do not have a clear target, our hard work will be of no use. Thirdly, we should not get de-motivated by the obstacles that come in our way. We should try to fight with all the odds courageously. Fourth, we should try to take risks as and when required because they can give you a better result. Lastly, we should try to enhance our knowledge and we should keep on learning new things as they can help us in long run.
To recapitulate, academic grades are just one of the factors that lead to success and consequently, through hard work and perseverance it is possible to achieve success even if one fails at school.",8,some-people-fail-in-school-but-end-up-being-successful-in-life-band-8-ielts-essay-sample-2
506,Everyone should stay in school until the age of eighteen. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often said that education is the gateway to a successful life. Hence it is argued that students ought to study in schools until the age of eighteen years. I completely agree with this view.
The most important reason for making school education mandatory for all students is the potential professional opportunities it offers. This is because the majority of the skilled jobs require a minimum level of education, which could only be achieved if one stays in school till the age of eighteen. For instance, professional subjects like engineering, medicine, law and management cannot be learnt in primary school. Hence, it is necessary to stay in school for a longer period of time, if one wants to learn these skills.
Of course, there are some students who are not good at academics and they may want to build a career in other fields which require vocational training. However, it is not necessary for them to drop out because most schools now impart vocational training as well along with core subjects. For example, a student who wants to become a carpenter can join the apprentice course and continue to learn his academic subjects. In other words, there is no need to drop out of school to obtain vocational skills. What’s more, high school education will make it easier for them to survive in the real world when they enter their adulthood.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that schooling should be mandatory till the age of eighteen as it provides many future opportunities which cannot be ignored unless there are some specific benefits to dropping out.",8,everyone-should-stay-in-school-until-the-age-of-eighteen-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
507,"In many places, shopping is the leisure time activity for young adults. Why is it so? Do you think it is a negative or a positive development?","Time is changing and so are the favourite pastimes of youngsters. Nowadays, many adults can be seen spending time doing shopping. The ever changing fashion trends and the desire to show off in front of friends are the main causes of this change. In my opinion, this is a negative development because of the wastage of money, time and energy.
Every day a new fashion trend or a new gadget is introduced in the market. The young adults want to update their wardrobe according to the latest market trends. For example, whenever a new movie is launched, girls try to imitate the style of the actress by buying clothes similar to what she wore in the movie. Moreover, many times adults want to show-off their status in front of their friends. They want to splurge money in order to do this. That is why we see many youngsters with large friend circles hopping from shop to shop and spending money.
This is a negative development because of the wastage of money. The youngsters spend their hard-earned money on unimportant things. They buy all the stuff which are useless and collect all the junk in their closets. Furthermore, it is a wastage of precious time and energy. The time which could be spent in a more productive way is spent on buying things which are not needed. Instead, they can join gymnastics or aerobics to have a healthy mind and body. Thus it is evident that mindless shopping / excessive shopping is a waste of money, time and energy.
To conclude, more and more youngsters now spend their time shopping because they want to follow the latest fashion trends and to impress their friends. However, it is a negative development as it is a complete waste of time, energy and more importantly money.",8,in-many-places-shopping-is-the-new-leisure-time-activity-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
508,Some film companies spend millions of dollars on the production of a single movie. Is it necessary to spend a lot of money to make a good movie? What factors contribute to the success of a movie?,"Film industry has grown significantly over the last few decades and some companies allocate a colossal budget to produce just one movie. Personally I do not believe that the quality of the movie depends on how much money was spent on it. Rather what matters are the storyline and the talent of the actors and other people associated with the movie.
Producing a film is definitely a process which requires a lot of money. Costumes, cameras, make up and exotic locations are all components of a regular movie and for sure cost a fortune. However, producers overspend when producing a film and incur unnecessarily expenses to add special effects expecting that in this way they will enrich the film. Yet these are not the key factors that determine if the movie is good enough or not.
Firstly, the storyline plays the most vital role in the success of a film. If the story is not strong enough to attract the audience, making a film on it is undoubtedly fruitless and will have devastating results. Secondly, choosing the actors who suit the role they are playing is also imperative. Many film stars have become instrumental in producing legendary movies because of their talent and their incredible ability to enact the characters in the most realistic way. For example, movies of hugely popular actors like Tom Cruise become successful regardless of their storyline or budget.
To conclude, although film production needs a huge chunk of money, it is not the key factor in making the film successful as the story, the acting and the direction are equally if not more important.",8,some-film-companies-spend-millions-of-dollars-on-the-production-of-a-single-movie-band-8-ielts-essay-sample-2
509,The maintenance of public libraries is a waste of money because of computer technologies that have the same function. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that free community libraries are not in much use in the modern era of computers. Hence according to them maintenance of these libraries is a waste of resources. I completely disagree with this view as public libraries help people who cannot afford money for the internet. Additionally, it is difficult to verify whether online information is real or fake.
On the one hand, several lines of evidence suggest that public libraries help many people to gain knowledge and information. To begin with, there are many students who are not able to spend money for personal computers and hence use libraries to get knowledge and information. Furthermore, community libraries are the cheapest source of information for everyone. Also in rural areas where internet access is still limited, public libraries are the source of information for students.
On the other hand, the internet is not a reliable source of information. Firstly, there is too much information available on the internet which makes it difficult for students to differentiate between fake and real information. Also, just about anyone can post anything on the internet. There is no one to verify the veracity of content posted by online users. Consequently, chances of coming across false or harmful information on the internet are pretty high.
To conclude, although the internet has made the information readily available, books are still the most trusted source of information as they are written by well known academicians and researchers. Hence, the government should continue to spend money on the maintenance of public libraries as these are important sources of knowledge.",8,the-maintenance-of-public-libraries-is-a-waste-of-money-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
510,Some parents prefer to have their children raised by their grandparents. Some prefer to raise them on their own. Which would you prefer and why? Include specific details and examples to support.,"Many people believe that kids should be raised by their parents while there are some who believe that children should be raised by their grandparents. In my opinion it is better for children to be raised by both parents and grandparents because parenting requires a great deal of time and some special skills and it is not always possible for young parents to possess them both. Personally I would like to raise my children on my own but I will also very much appreciate the help of my parents.
Parents are certainly more responsible than grandparents for raising children. However, several lines of evidence suggest that working parents find it difficult to manage both work and family due to their busy schedule. They will certainly benefit if their parents are around to take care of their babies. Also most parents are more comfortable about leaving their children in the care of their grandparents than in a day care home. This is because grandparents are naturally fond of their grandchildren and will take great care to ensure their wellbeing. Also grandparents are better than parents at inculcating values in young children. Needless to say, children who grow up under the foster care of their grandparents tend to be more family oriented and compassionate.
On the other hand, grandparents alone cannot take good care of the children. To start with, most of them tend to be overindulgent. They will often go out of their way to satisfy every whim and fancy of their grandparents. This kind of pampering may hurt the overall development of their children. Parents, by contrast, are more likely to set limits and enforce a code of conduct. Also in most families parents tend to be more educated than grandparents and hence they are better at helping the children with their homework and studies.
To conclude, in my opinion, both parents and grandparents have an equal role to play in the development of children. If grandparents help with the raising of their grandchildren life will be a lot less stressful for busy working parents. In the end, this arrangement will benefit all.",8,some-parents-prefer-to-have-their-children-raised-by-their-grandparents-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
511,Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school. Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"While some people believe that children ought to be sent to schools, there are many parents who feel home schooling is more advantageous.  I am of the opinion that children who go to school enjoy better overall development than those who learn at home.
Firstly, at school, students learn many life lessons which help them become better human beings. For example, they make new friends and learn to socialize. They are also taught moral values of sharing and caring. Secondly, most schools follow a curriculum that gives equal importance to education as well as sports. This helps children to have an all round development of both the mind and the body. Playing sport as a hobby and also competitively, helps them to learn the qualities of working in a team while also developing their physical strength. Lastly, schools provide exposure to events and activities such as career fairs and inter school competitions. This is where students are introduced to the world outside of their own school. They are provided with ample opportunities that can help them choose a promising career and to have a better life.
There are some children who have special needs or require medical attention. Homeschooling is better for them because they might not receive the care and attention they need in a regular school. In such cases, home schooling is beneficial as parents will not be worried of their child’s health. Also, there are some families who live below the poverty line and they cannot afford to send children to school because of the high fees. For instance, educating a child at home will help the families to reduce additional costs such as field trips, proms, science fairs etc.
To conclude, after analyzing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that home schooling may be beneficial for some children; however, for the vast majority of kids going to a regular school is a much better option because a school provides plenty of opportunities for children to learn from their peers and socialize.",8,some-people-believe-that-teaching-children-at-home-is-best-for-a-childs-development-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
512,Shopping is the favorite pastime for most of the young people. Why do you think is that? Do you think they should be encouraged to do some useful activities in their free time?,"Shopping has become an integral part of our life. Young people are more attracted to this habit than older people and it has almost become their favorite hobby. While there are many reasons attributed to this habit such as increased spending power and peer influences, some people argue that they should be encouraged to spend their time wisely in other useful activities and I completely agree with that because time is the most precious thing in the world.
For one thing, the increased spending power is one of the main reasons for this addiction to shopping in our society. Compared to the past, there are many job opportunities available in the market and most of them are ready to pay fat paychecks. Our young people now have plenty of disposable income they don’t know how to spend.
Secondly, they are easily getting influenced by their peers who might be doing window shopping almost every week, for no reasons. The recent survey conducted by SurveyMonkey.com on Bayshore Shopping Mall business in Kanata city, indicates that majority of their sales are coming from younger people who had just started their career..
Having said that, some people argue that our young society needs to be diverted and encouraged to spend their free time in more better and useful ways. I strongly agree with that, because the only thing that cannot be retrieved back is “the time”. Instead of spending time in shopping malls, we should encourage them to involve in physical activities such as sports and games. Or they can join a course that enhances their skill sets. For instance, those in the software field can spend their time in learning Artificial Intelligence which is growing very fast in today’s market.
In conclusion, while it is true that young people are getting attracted towards frequent shopping, they should be encouraged to spend their free time more wisely on activities that could help them to lead a more comfortable and healthy life.",8,shopping-is-the-favourite-pastime-for-most-of-the-young-people-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
513,Some People believe that children should be brought up in cities. Others believe that countryside offers a better environment for children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"People often debate whether it is better to raise children in the countryside than in the city.  While some people favour the raising of children in an environment which has all the modern amenities and infrastructure others prefer the safe and pollution free environment of the countryside. Both views will be discussed in this essay although I personally believe that it is better to bring up kids in cities.
No doubt, there are plenty of benefits to raising children in cities. They have access to all the requirements of their study and extra-curricular activities. For example all the latest books and material required for projects are readily available in big cities as compared to villages and suburban areas. Moreover, there are plenty of good schools in cities so parents can easily find an institution that suits the needs of their children. There are schools available for differently-abled children in metropolitan cities. Cities are equipped with museums and libraries that assist children in their studies. Furthermore, in cities lots of cultural events take place on a routine basis in which the children can take part and get connected to their culture.
Living in a village too offers a set of advantages. To start with, it provides children with cleaner and pollution free environment which is not available in cities. Clean environment is a must for the health of a child. To add to it, the countryside provides open areas to play in and parents do not have to worry about their child being hit by a vehicle as there is less traffic. Most importantly, in villages there is a sense of belonging whereas in cities people do not even know their neighbours. However, life in the countryside has its disadvantages too. Children growing up in villages do not have access to high quality education as there are fewer good schools and colleges there. Also, they will eventually have to move to cities for higher studies. Their access to modern tools like the internet is somewhat limited. In addition, they have hardly any exposure to the world outside.
To conclude, there are many health benefits to bringing up a child in the countryside, but we are living in the 21st  century and to adapt to it accordingly, lifestyle and opportunities available in cities are the best.",8,some-people-believe-that-children-should-be-brought-up-in-cities-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
514,Nowadays we are producing more and more rubbish. Why do you think this is happening? What can governments do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced?,"Much advancement in the field of science and technology has resulted in the creation of waste. Industrialization also creates a lot of waste and thus pollutes our environment and water bodies. It is time for the government, the industries and the public to take certain initiatives to reduce the amount of waste produced.
Firstly, science has revolutionized the field of medicine, with the introduction of new treatments to cure diseases. However, this comes at the cost of huge medical waste being produced in the hospitals. For example, earlier hospitals used to sterilize the needles after use, whereas now they have access to disposable ones which are cheap and efficient. Secondly, due to innovations in technology, industries are finding ways to speed up their production process. Because they want to produce more goods in less time, they decide not to recycle items.  Lastly, an increase in the number of industries has created more employment opportunities which have improved the people’s standard of living. For instance, people can now afford to buy new mobile phones every 3 to 4 months and discard the old ones. This creates a lot of plastic waste which is not biodegradable.
While it might not be feasible to reduce the quantity of waste that is being produced, the government and the manufactures should take up steps to reuse and recycle. All of us can learn a lesson or two from space astronauts who recycle even urine into drinking water thus eliminating waste. The government must also come up with more programs to encourage the industries to create products that can be recycled, thus educating the people to recycle after use rather than throwing them away.
To conclude, technical, industrial and scientific inventions have increased the amount of waste that is being produced. But, science also teaches us to recycle waste or to use raw materials that produce minimum waste.",8,nowadays-we-are-producing-more-and-more-rubbish-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
515,"Over the last few decades, the media has promoted the image of young thin women as being ideal. What problems has this caused? What solutions can you suggest to this issue?","Most women we see on television or in advertisements are portrayed as young and slim irrespective of their age or the nature of their work. This creates a mindset among the people that this is how an ideal woman should be like. In my opinion, this is not fair. The media should act more responsibly and portray women for their accomplishments rather than their body type.
Although it is essential for women working as models and actresses to maintain a slim body structure, sometimes they tend to become competitive and career driven and end up developing health disorders like anorexia.  It has also become common for teenagers aspiring to become an actress or a model to develop eating disorders in order to remain slim. Also, such careers have a short shelf life and mostly, after crossing the age of 30, opportunities of finding a job become very rare. This causes the women to go into depression and ultimately some of them commit suicide.
One way to overcome this problem is to encourage the media to show realistic programs. For example movies should show moms as strong, independent and career oriented rather than slim and petite. In my opinion, we also require more television series focusing on powerful women who brought about a change in the society such as Indira Gandhi or Rani Laxmibai. This will help to eliminate the existing stereotypes of women.
To conclude, media must create awareness among the public that it is not necessary for a woman to be young and thin in order to be perfect. What matters more is that the women should be educated and independent. This approach will also empower more women and bring about a change in the society.",8,over-the-last-few-decades-media-has-promoted-the-image-of-young-thin-women-as-being-ideal-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
516,Some film companies spend millions of dollars on the production of a single movie. Is it necessary to spend a lot of money to make a good movie? What factors contribute to the success of a movie? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Film making has become a multimillion dollar industry. Most movies are made on a budget of several millions of dollars. However, money alone cannot guarantee the success of a movie. There are a few other factors which are more important than money in making good films.
Although money can make a movie more entertaining by adding special effects, it does not guarantee that it will do well at the box office. For example, the first Bollywood film to enter the superhero genre was made on a budget of 25 million dollars. However, it was not well accepted by the people and the producers lost a huge chunk of their money. On the other hand, a movie with a good story, set in a simple town with a pair of talented actors would be appreciated more by the people.
One factor that contributes to making hit movies is the storyline. It should have an element of surprise that keeps the audience hooked till the end. For instance, there are many budding script writers waiting to get a chance to showcase their work. Film companies should try to look for new and promising talent who may work for a lower pay but provide quality in their work.
Finally, another factor that can make successful movies is the actors. The audience connects with the actors who can make them feel the emotions acted out on the screen. Famous actors demand a higher salary but there are always theatre actors and students pursuing acting who would do the same job at a lower pay. The audiences look forward to seeing fresh faces and good actors are always appreciated.
In conclusion, money is not the only factor that ensures the success of a movie. Other factors such as the storyline, screenplay and acting are equally important.",8,some-film-companies-spend-millions-of-dollars-on-the-production-of-a-single-movie-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
517,Immigration has a major impact on the society. What are the main reasons for immigration? What consequences can it lead to?,"Earlier man’s fundamental needs consisted of food, clothing and shelter. However, today every person wants to achieve a lot more than the basic necessities. They need a comfortable life and the best education for their kids. Because of this and many other reasons people leave their home country and migrate to new places in search of a better life.
Primarily, people from the under developed countries prefer to move to the developed nations for better education for their children and a higher standard of living for the whole family. Another problem is the lack of employment opportunities in developing and under developed countries which encourage people to move to more progressive countries in search of jobs. Most people find it difficult to earn a decent livelihood and hence are unable to provide a better life for their family.
Lastly, thousands of people have lost their homes and live in fear due to political unrest and war. These refugees are in need of a safe environment to live in and raise their families. Due to which, they immigrate to a country where their lives would not be in danger.
However, there is a downside to immigration. For most of the immigrants, it is the harsh reality of life in the new place. Many a times, it is not as per their expectation and hence they tend to get disappointed. It could also lead to overcrowding which could restrict the government from providing basic facilities for their citizens. The biggest problem that refugees face with immigration is the difficulty in fitting in. They end up in a country where they do not know the local language and hence find it more difficult to adjust. In such cases the government has to take up the additional responsibility of providing training facilities to help the new people to settle in.
To conclude, the desire to live a peaceful and secured life is what causes people to leave the place where they were born and move to an unknown land. However, it is important that people make informed decisions about the country they choose to live in. This would make the transition process less painful for all.",8,what-are-the-main-causes-of-immigration-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
518,Some people  give their children whatever they ask for and let them do whatever they like. Is this good for the children? What are the consequences of this for the children when these grow up?,"Currently, there is a growing trend among parents to fulfil their children’s every demand and to give them as much freedom as they want. In my opinion, this child- rearing practice is detrimental to the development of children, and its repercussions will affect them in their adulthood.
To begin with, the over-indulgence can prevent children from acquiring important life skills. First, children who are granted every request can develop dependence on their parents for everything, and this can deprive them of the motivation to strive hard in life and be independent. Second, when children have too much freedom they may get into bad things. For example, it is quite possible for them to get into bad company and develop habits like smoking and drinking. They may also get into immoral and illegal activities if they are not under the supervision of their parents
Children of indulgent or lenient parents are likely to grow up with several negative personality traits. The first adverse effect is that children become self-centered with little consideration for the feelings of others, and they always put their priorities first. When they become adults they will find it difficult to work successfully in teams as they have not learned the importance of teamwork. Nor can they show respect for others. Another disadvantage is that children who have had all of their wishes fulfilled by their parents will find it rather difficult to deal with setbacks and rejections which they will invariably have to face as they enter adulthood. Eventually, they will develop many personality disorders that will prevent them from having a normal life.
To conclude, I strongly believe that parents who fulfill all the wishes of their children hurt their normal development by preventing them from learning important life skills. Also, children who are used to having all of their wishes are fulfilled are more likely to be selfish and self-centered.",8,some-people-give-their-children-whatever-they-ask-for-and-let-them-do-whatever-they-like-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
519,Some people think that young people should choose their professions themselves. Others believe that their parents should choose for them. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Nowadays there are many people who feel that youngsters should have the freedom to choose their career on their own. I support this view because in my opinion a profession chosen by the parents may not be right for their children.
When young people choose their career path they reap many benefits. The biggest benefit is that they will never choose a profession that they do not like. For example, someone interested in photography is much less likely to opt to be a doctor if they have the freedom to decide what they should do with their life. Also, youngsters know their strengths and weaknesses better than anybody else. This enables them to make the right choices. Career, after all, is an important part of life and having a job that one likes is one of the prerequisites for happiness.
On the flip side, it is a common practice in many countries for parents to choose a career for their children. There is no doubt that parents are more experienced and they may also have a better understanding of the job market and future prospects of various career options. Even so, when they choose a career for their children, they are more likely to choose one that enhances their social status. For example, in India, most parents want their children to be a doctor or an engineer. They do not really care whether the child has the aptitude for this profession or not.
To conclude, after analyzing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that youngsters choosing their own profession is better than parents making this choice for them. Parents should definitely offer them valuable advice but the final decision should be made by the youngster who will hold the job.",8,some-people-think-that-young-people-should-choose-their-professions-themselves-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
520,Some people think that the government is wasting money on arts and that this money could be better spent elsewhere. To what extent do you agree with this view?,"There is no doubt that art is important but it is debatable whether it should be sponsored by the government. Some people insist that the government is wasting money on arts. In their opinion, it is important to spend this money on more useful things. I agree with this view.
For one thing, arts promotions and events can be organized by many other private organizations or society clubs and you do not really need a government intervention to run the show.  There are many clubs such as Lion’s club or YMCC clubs that can take the initiative and sponsor such events.  For example, a music program or an exhibition of paintings can be organized by a local club and there is no need for the government to sponsor it. There are also many rich people who take pleasure in sponsoring art shows and programmes.
When the government does not have to spend money on arts it can focus on developing core areas like education, healthcare and infrastructure. Poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition are still a major problem in many countries around the world. For example, in India, millions of students still do not go to school. Likewise, there are numerous homeless people. Therefore, instead of spending the public funds on arts, the government should try to improve the health of its people. It should ensure that all children are going to school and they have access to good food and potable water.
In conclusion, while arts events and programmes are important for the society, they should not be sponsored by the tax money contributed by people. The government should focus on more important areas and use its money for the benefit and upliftment of the human society.",8,the-government-is-wasting-money-on-arts-and-this-money-could-be-better-spent-elsewhere-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
521,"Nowadays news companies spend a lot of money covering international news. However, local news is more relevant to people’s lives and should receive more funding. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.","Every second we get bombarded by news from different corners of the world. We receive it on my mobile, in our inbox, on television and in newspapers. There are some media houses which spend a major portion of their budget for covering international news. I think it is also very important that sufficient funding is provided to cover local news thoroughly.
Firstly regional news tends to have a profound effect on one’s life. This is to say, forecast about sudden change in local weather or a traffic jam would have an immediate effect on the day-to-day life of a person. Furthermore, in the event of natural calamities, people should be informed as quickly as possible so that they can take necessary precautions. Introduction of features like local flash news or provision of small window on TV screens for local news, might be helpful.
On the other hand, international news is usually full of violence and misery. Much of it is concerned with wars and conflicts. If people watch these types of news more often, they might feel that they live in a dangerous world. In addition, events happening in one corner of the world usually do not have an immediate effect on the reader in other parts of the world. However, news about local communities helping each other might lift people’s spirit.
In conclusion, events around the world might be interesting to some people; however, in my opinion, local news should be given equal or more coverage in newspapers and on television because it has a greater and often more immediate impact on the reader and the local community.",8,nowadays-news-companies-spend-a-lot-of-money-covering-international-news-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
522,Some people think that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel for cars and other vehicles. Do you agree or disagree?,"Environmental  pollution has been a major concern in today’s society, and some people feel that governments should raise the price of fuel to resolve this issue. In my opinion, it may help to some extent; however, this is not the only solution to tackle this problem.
To begin with,  increasing the price of petrol can help reduce the environmental pollution to some degree. In other words, excessive use of cars releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which is detrimental to the environment. If the price of petrol is increased / hiked), individuals will start to use their cars less often and this in turn can decelerate the rate of air pollution. However, the increase in the cost of petrol will not stop the environmental pollution. Besides, the fuel price determines the market prices of other essential commodities, and increasing the price can affect poor and middle class families.
On the other hand, governments can take other measures to mitigate these problems. A better solution is to invest in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and tide rather than non-renewable resources like coal and petrol. For example, solar power in the United States has proven its efficiency in energy production. Second, by improving public transportation and reducing the cost of traveling, the government can encourage more people to use public transport; this practice can help clean the environment and reduce traffic.
To conclude, I strongly believe that the hike in the petrol price is not the best solution to this problem. Improving the efficiency of public transport and investing in renewable energy sources are better alternatives that ought to be considered.",8,some-people-think-that-the-best-way-to-solve-environmental-problems-is-to-increase-the-price-of-petrol-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
523,News stories on TV and in newspapers are very often accompanied by pictures. Some people say that these pictures are more effective than words. What is your opinion about this?,"It is often said that pictures speak louder than words. I suppose this maxim goes well with the way news stories are presented by newspapers and television channels. Some people say that it is better to use more pictures. I agree with this viewpoint to a great extent.
A pictorial and graphical depiction of news stories can be very appealing and convincing. It can also cheer up the mood of the readers. For example, a candid image of a rejoicing sports team after winning a world cup trophy. For example, a candid image of a rejoicing sports team after winning a world cup trophy will warm many hearts. Sometimes, it may just take a single picture to narrate a sordid tale or describe the enormity of the situation. For instance, a front page image of a crying child in a flood affected surrounding speaks volumes. To cite another example, the picture of the grieving family of a martyred solider can have quite an impact on the reader / the nation.
Furthermore, news with photos arouses the reader’s interest to a large extent. In my favourite newspaper ‘Bombay Times’, pictures of various celebrities compel me to read the articles about them. Depending on our interest area, a related image can draw our attention to read the entire article. Lastly, news with pictures can be comprehended in a relatively short time than words. In our busy lives, a quick glance over some news headings and images in the morning newspaper may sound better than reading full news.
On the flip side, I feel care should be taken not to share pictures of some confidential, sensitive and obscene contents. Also, some articles on research, surveys and writer’s opinion are best to be read at full length without the accompaniment of pictures.
In summary, I believe pictures in the newspapers and TV channels can create a lasting impression on our mind with their positive, powerful or heart-rending message. They also make the news stories more interesting and easy to comprehend.",8,news-stories-are-often-accompanied-by-pictures-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
524,"Some people say that now we can see films on our phones or tablets there is no need to go to the cinema. Others say that to be fully enjoyed, films need to be seen in a cinema. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","We live in a fast paced world and movies are the biggest source of entertainment for us. Whether we should watch it on electronic gadgets or in a cinema is an oft-heard question. In my opinion, movies should be watched on the silver screen. Both sides of the argument will be discussed in this essay.
There are certainly a few benefits to watching movies on electronic gadgets. For example, a working professional who travels to office on public transport like bus can watch films on his way to work.  Another advantage of watching movies on a tablet is that they can save money. Going to theatres to watch movies can be quite expensive. Movie tickets are not cheap. Also we need to factor in the cost of traveling and refreshments like popcorn and drinks.
Even so, in my opinion, there are many more benefits to watching a movie in a cinema. Movie halls provide a completely different experience.  The surround system and large screen gives total entertainment. Also, watching movies in theatres is a great way to say no to privacy. Pirated movies can be watched on gadgets and this in return causes losses to production houses which produce the film. There are also some health benefits to watching movies in a cinema. Watching them on small screens for long hours can cause eyestrain, blurred vision and pain in the neck and shoulders.
To conclude, watching movies on gadgets saves time and money, but in the long run it is harmful for health. Also, it hurts film producers. On the other hand, watching movies in theatre is complete enjoyment.",8,we-can-now-watch-movies-on-phones-so-there-is-no-need-to-go-to-the-cinema-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
525,Some people think that young people should choose their professions themselves. Others believe that their parents should choose for them. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Deciding on a profession or career path is an important milestone in an individual’s life. While some people argue that young individuals should make their own decisions when choosing a profession, others, however, state that parents should make that choice for them. Personally, I believe that making independent choices is very important in a person’s professional and personal life.
For the development of an individual’s professional life, it is very important that they make their own decision. Making a choice on their own does not mean not listening to other people’s point of view; rather it means absorbing all the available information and coming to a conclusion on one’s own). Choosing a profession of one’s preference / liking means that they will love what they do). It makes work very interesting and also provides satisfaction. Making one’s own choice also gives a sense of ownership and responsibility. Individuals are more likely to strive to achieve excellence in a profession they like. Young people also have a different understanding of the new world that might be different from their parents. So, they might be in a better position to make informed decisions.
Parents, on the other hand, have lots of experience than their children, so it is equally important to listen to them for guidance on professional matters. Parents have seen the world changing with them and they have a better idea of which field is more reliable and which is risky. Therefore, their guidance is very important for a stable life. Most of the time parents know their children better, so they are likely to suggest a profession that suits them.
While both of these views are valid, I believe the autonomy / the freedom to choose one’s professional life is very important. Choosing one’s own career gives them a sense of ownership and satisfaction. If young people choose what they like for profession, they are more likely to put their heart and soul into it and it is the formula for success.
To conclude, young people should choose their own career path but should always consider their parents’ advice while making a decision. Parents should guide them in the right direction but at the same time should allow young individuals to choose their own career path.",8,some-people-think-young-people-should-choose-their-professions-themselves-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
526,"In some area of the US, a ‘curfew’ is imposed, in which teenagers are not allowed to be out of doors after a particular time at night unless they are accompanied by an adult. What is your opinion on this?","In many parts of the US, adolescents are not allowed to be outside their home after a certain hour of the night if they are not accompanied by an adult. In my opinion, this is essential in order to ensure their safety and prevent them from getting involved in some detrimental activities.
Safety of the child is of paramount importance for any parent and in some areas, this is often compromised during late nights. Firstly, as per the statistics, some localities and areas have a higher crime rate than others. The miscreants and paedophiles operate at night after a particular time; hence, in such cases, it is advisable and sensible that teenagers who are naïve and sometimes volatile in their interactions with such criminals are accompanied by an adult to deter the crime and mishap. In addition, some areas are prone to accident mainly due to the movement of heavy vehicles, so an adult’s presence and their driving experience prevents adolescents from any accidental hazards.
Moreover, there are many anti-social groups that operate during night and try to entice the young teenagers into activities that are detrimental for them such as, drugs and alcohol consumption. Presence of an adult or a parent dissuades them in approaching the teenager and hence prevents them from getting involved in activities that are baneful for them as an individual, as well as has harmful effects on the society and the community.
In conclusion, it is pivotal for a teenager’s safety and holistic growth without any interruption that they are accompanied by an adult after a certain time of the night; hence the curfew is rightly justified.",8,in-some-areas-of-the-us-teenagers-are-not-allowed-to-be-out-of-door-after-a-particular-time-of-night-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
527,Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"The technology has invaded into almost every space that it is not unrealistic to presume that artificial intelligence would replace humans in the workplace. Though such a change is possible in the commercial and manufacturing sectors, robots and computers cannot take over some jobs which require human interactions such as those in the fields of health care and academics.
To begin with, artificial intelligence cannot replace certain occupations in medical field which demand empathy and a therapeutic touch. For instance, robots cannot substitute a nurse who can care for a suffering human being holistically because it is a complex process involving ethics and human rights. Furthermore, in such jobs, safety is a key concern and a critically ill patient cannot be left with a machine, unsupervised. On the other hand, in the case of tasks which need accuracy and precise calculations, such as construction and banking, artificial intelligence would be beneficial. Thus, it is seen that sophisticated technology can dominate some realms while it has several limitations in others
Similarly, teaching is another area where artificially intelligent robots could be a failure. Because this job requires keen observation and command over each student, it would not be possible for a programmed machine to give individual attention to the pupils. While using robots would not be fruitful in face to face teaching, it could be useful in more complex simulative studies and scientific researches where manual interference could be detrimental. For example, robots are launched in spaceships to collect data from extraterrestrial planets and spaces, where direct human contact would be fatal. Therefore, it can be inferred that artificial intelligence cannot be implemented in jobs where human contact is important but is undoubtedly productive in advanced and technically complicated assignments.
To conclude, application of artificial intelligence has its own boundaries. It can dominate in several fields but it cannot rule over each and every sector where manual operations are necessary.",8,all-jobs-will-eventually-be-done-by-artificially-intelligent-robots-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
528,Some people say that it is possible to tell a lot about a person’s culture and character from their choice of clothes. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that we can predict a person’s culture and character from their choice of clothing. While I do admit that a person’s outward appearance tells a lot about them I do not completely agree with this view.
It is possible to guess a person’s background and nature from their clothes. However, one may not be able to predict their character and values. A person always wearing religious or traditional costumes may reveal their devotional and spiritual nature. A usually decent and formally clad individual portrays simplicity and modesty. Multi-colored and flashy outfits can indicate a person’s exuberant and lively nature. For example, entertainers and celebrities are often seen wearing jazzy dresses. Also, an odd-colored, loosely-fitted and shabby clothing may be an indicator of a careless attitude.
Nevertheless, I feel that outward appearance and looks can be deceptive. It may disguise a person’s true inner self and any malevolent intent. For example, some imposters donning sacred robes and religious symbols may defraud innocent followers. This was evidently seen in the recent criminal cases filed against self-proclaimed saints in India. Moreover, a person’s choice of clothing cannot always be used as a reflection of their character in general. To cite an example, a woman wearing light and short clothes for her comfort may incorrectly be perceived as indecent in some countries.
In summary, a person’s style of dressing can be an indicator of their thought patterns, and outlook towards life and culture. It can also show some of their qualities and attributes. However, it would be incorrect to draw a conclusion about someone based on their external appearance.",8,some-people-say-that-it-is-possible-to-tell-a-lot-about-a-persons-culture-and-character-from-their-choice-of-clothing-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
529,"Some believe elderly people should live in nursing homes, others think they should live with their family members. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is no doubt that older people have to counter many health issues and other problems. Therefore, they need a full time caretaker. For this reason, some people opine that it is beneficial for elderly people to spend the last phase of their life in nursing homes; however, others think that they should stay with their family members. In my opinion, older people should live in nursing homes as they have experienced and specialized staff that can efficiently take care of them.
On the one hand, some people are of the view that during old age a person ought to live in nursing homes and I agree with them. Firstly, health of an elderly person continuously deteriorates; thus, it is important that they are surrounded by medical experts. Secondly, these nursing homes are designed in such a way that they are safer for the elderly. They also use the latest technologies and innovations to make the life of elderly people comfortable and convenient. For instance, nursing homes are well equipped with lifts, computerized wheel chairs and escalators to name a few.
On the other hand, there are many people who argue that seniors should be able to live with their family members in their home. There are certainly some benefits to this arrangement. To start with, elders are happier in the company of their children and grandchildren. They feel loved and cherished when they get to live with their near and dear ones. However, there is a serious problem with this arrangement. Often times, youngsters are too busy to take care of their ageing parents. They spend long hours at the workplace leaving their sick or old parents alone at home. Consequently, the elderly often have to battle depression and loneliness. Also, if they are alone at home, they may not get immediate care and attention in a medical emergency.
In conclusion, the elderly should live in nursing homes as they receive proper care and attention there. Moreover, in the nursing home, their health is regularly monitored by nurses and doctors whereas at home family members are often too busy to devote time to their needs.",8,some-believe-that-elderly-people-should-live-in-nursing-homes-others-think-they-should-live-with-their-family-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
530,"Many historical sites and museums are mainly  visited by tourists, not local people. Why is this the case? What can be done to attract local people  to visit this historical  sites and museums?","It is true that  historical places and museums attract  a large number of tourists; however, locals show little interest in them. In my opinion, there are several reasons behind this trend and governments can take certain measures to encourage locals to visit.
To begin with,  People find it boring to visit such places. In other words, they are already familiar with their culture and history and perhaps have nothing new to discover by visiting the same museum repeatedly; therefore, they avoid visiting these places  as they consider  such visits  a waste of time. A tourist, on the other hand, is eager to explore new places of interest in their destinations , and museums and historical places will help them to have a better understanding of  the history and culture of the countries  they are visiting. Another reason is that museums charge an entry fee which could be the major factor that discourages the local people .  If a person visited it once, they would avoid visiting it again because nobody wants to pay again to watch the same artworks.
Governments can take steps to encourage local residents to attend museums and historical buildings. First, authorities can organize cultural events and regular exhibitions at these places to provide people with a new experience every time they visit them. The second solution would be offering free tickets and discounts at the weekends so that low income and middle income families can visit. For example, schools can provide assignments related to the history of a country, and this will motivate parents to take their children to the historical museums to collect useful information which will help them excel in their studies.
To conclude, local people do not enjoy visiting museums or historical places because there is not much they can learn from these places. Foreigners, on the other hand, are curious to learn more and more about their destinations and hence they make it a point to visit these places. The government can encourage more natives to visit by conducting interesting programmes like exhibitions at these places and offering free or subsidised entry.",8,historical-sites-and-museums-are-mainly-visited-by-tourists-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
531,"University education should be free to everyone, regardless of income. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Education plays a crucial role in ensuring the success of a person. There is a contentious argument about whether people should pay for university education or not. In my opinion, tertiary education ought to be free for all.
To begin with, the foremost reason for free education is that it will bring parity in the society. Some people are unable to pursue higher studies because of monetary concerns. Hence, free university education will benefit the weaker section of the population. Moreover, there will be tremendous impact on the economy of the nation as all the people will achieve employment opportunities due to their enhanced knowledge and skills. For instance, a nation where literacy rate is high will invariably have a higher per capita income.
Furthermore, having free education can provide students an opportunity to explore a career of their own choice. To illustrate, sometimes parents cannot afford the hefty fee of professional courses like engineering and this inability hampers the child’s future as they cannot study a subject of their interest. Also, when university education is free for all, private institutions will not be able to exploit students by charging hefty fee for admission.
To conclude, there are several benefits to making university education free for all. It will make the education system fair and provide equal opportunities to all. Hence, government should take imperative measures to promote free education and exploitive policies like admission through capitation should be abolished. After all, an educated population is the biggest asset of any nation.",8,university-education-should-be-free-to-everyone-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
532,"People are less fit and active nowadays than in the past, what are the reasons for this? What do you think can be done for it?","In the modern world people are lethargic and more prone to diseases than the people in the past. The unprecedented developments in the field of science and technology have lead to so many inventions that the need for physical exertion / activity has reduced to a great extent. The only way to improve this situation is for people to focus on their fitness levels and to eat a balanced diet.
The older generation performed all the chores manually and this required them to use all parts of their body. Consequently, they enjoyed better fitness levels than the present generation. Apart from that the diet was also very basic and healthy which kept the bones stronger. For instance, my grandfather had a very good physique even at the age of ninety. His diet consisted of green vegetables, salads and chapatis. Every evening he used to go for a walk which helped him to stay fit.
Today’s generation is far more educated than those in the past so it gives them the opportunity to understand their body well and take care of it accordingly. People need to plan a healthy diet to get the required nutrition for the body and at the same time unhealthy junk food has to be avoided. Fast foods like pizzas and burgers are very popular but they harm the body in the long to their excessive content of oils and carbohydrates. Physical fitness can be taken care of by following simple lifestyle changes like using stairs in place of lift etc. Walking and exercising can also be included in the fitness regime.
It is rightly said that a healthy mind stays in a healthy body. If the body is ignored, the mind will automatically start getting affected which is an alarming situation for the entire body. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to take the necessary measures and stay fit.",8,people-are-less-fit-and-active-now-than-in-the-past-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
533,It is common practice for some students to take a gap year between high school and university in order to do charitable work abroad in under developed countries. What are the advantages and disadvantages for young people of doing volunteer work?,"Working for a charity that helps under privileged people is considered as a noble and selfless act. Nowadays, it is a common practice among young people to take a break between secondary and tertiary education to get involved in some voluntary work in developing countries. Though this phenomenon has numerous benefits, it also comes with a few drawbacks. In this essay we shall discuss both the merits and demerits of this recent trend.
Firstly, going abroad and doing things other than studying gives the youngsters an opportunity to break free from their usual workload and stress and therefore helps them to relax. It is a great opportunity to gather work experience that will definitely be helpful in later life. Furthermore, this first-hand experience of working with the underprivileged helps them see the picture of the world outside of their own comfortable life. Also they get to face real world challenges which help them develop empathy and become mature and responsible adults.
In addition to that, the positive experience of working for people in need and making a positive change in their life boosts their confidence. All of these factors help them become a better and successful person in future.
Regarding the disadvantages, the first challenge that these adolescents face after coming back from the break is to adjust with the old routine and to concentrate on studies. The new experience usually affects their mind and changes their outlook towards life which in turn makes it harder for them to follow the regular university schedule or pursue higher studies. For example, a survey done by the university of Pompeu Fabre in Spain shows that 10% of the students who took one year break after high school never joined university. The rate is even higher among the students who took a longer break. To mitigate this problem the university has appointed a special counselor for these kids.
In conclusion, we can say that although the practice of taking a temporary break and getting involved in charitable work has a few demerits, it has it has largely a positive impact on a person’s life and hence we should encourage this.",8,it-is-a-common-practice-for-some-students-to-take-a-gap-year-between-high-school-and-university-in-order-to-do-charitable-work-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
534,People especially mothers often decide to stay at home to look after their family instead of going to work. Do you think government should pay them the salary for it?,"It has been witnessed many times that after childbirth most of the mothers opt to stay at home for better nurturing of their children. For handling such situations better, I think the government should pay some remuneration to such mothers for a limited period of a time.
Firstly, the government should consider helping the mothers financially as children’s vaccines are expensive; still they need to be administered because vaccines offer protection from many life-threatening diseases. Children are the future of the country and their well being cannot be compromised. Secondly, the mother also needs nutritious food to recover timely. The baby is completely dependent on mother’s feed for the first six months so it’s crucial that the mother stays healthy.
While it is important to consider the well being of the mother and the baby, it is unlikely that the government can pay the salary for a long time. The population of our country is on the higher side so it is difficult for the government for pay allowances for very long. Therefore, the government should set a certain age limit till when they can support. For instance, in countries like England and Germany the government pays child care allowances to the parents till the children turn eighteen years old. This way, the government can ensure that raising children does not become a burden for the parents.
Family is always the first priority of mothers and they are even willing to sacrifice their career for the sake of their children. The government should offer them support by providing monthly allowances so that at least the expenses of raising a baby are taken care of.

535,The performance of staff can have a significant impact on the success of a company. What can companies do to increase staff productivity?,"The employees are the vital part of any organisation. it is true that the growth / success of a company depends upon its the hard work of its workers. Therefore, several measures should be implemented to increase the productivity of the employees.
To begin with, the workplace and the working condition should be appropriate. The company should provide a safe and conducive work environment with adequate facilities, proper lighting, hygienic washrooms and canteens. A better environment prevents the mind from getting distracted. Consequently, the staff can focus on their work and deliver better results. Furthermore, it is very important for a worker to be happy and satisfied because only a happy person can devote himself physically and mentally towards his work.
Companies should provide the assurance that the life of their staff is invaluable. Thus, the organisation needs to offer a helping hand by providing financial support and insurance. For instance, health benefits should be provided to an employee and their family members. This will promote the feeling of safety and security. Moreover, the staff appraisal system plays an important role in encouraging the staff. An efficient and hardworking employee should be rewarded in front of others. This will encourage other staff members to give their best to prove themselves. For example, in many Indian hospitals, dedicated nurses are given the title of ‘best nurse’ on nursing day. Hence, this will enhance the quality of care provided by nurses. Thus it is evident that, the reward system motivates the staff to give their best.
In conclusion, it is the sweat and blood of an employee which take companies to heights. Therefore, the staff productivity should be increased by keeping the workers happy and motivated by appreciating their work and rewarding them with raises and promotions.",8,the-performance-of-staff-can-have-a-significant-impact-on-the-success-of-a-company-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
536,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?","One may not have anticipated that applications of computers would be so widespread in the future when its prototype was invented some decades ago. In this essay, I intent to explore the impact of computerisation going forward and our dependence on it.
As we are steadily treading towards the path of digital transformation, I feel the computer technology will benefit us in almost all the spheres of our lives. Primarily, computers will revolutionize the world of work. Virtual desktop from home, electronic transfer or storage of almost all document types would become seamless. Most of the manual tasks in our daily lives will be automated by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. For example, bed ridden patients in hospitals may receive assistance from computers instead of nurses.
On the bright side, I suppose computers would also be of great help in the fields of medical research in managing crucial patients’ data. It will assist in the cashless transaction of all bills and expenses. Its digital implications will enable us to shop, travel, transact and fulfill administrative duties effortlessly. Automation has already enhanced productivity and improved the quality of life of employees.
At the same time, I believe we should be wary of the misuse of computers and our over dependency on it. Hacking social security systems, malicious software or virus development are some of the potential threats. For example, hackers may steal confidential data with the help of malicious software. Moreover, recent studies and news articles have warned that more than fifty percent of manual jobs will become obsolete due to automation.
On a conclusive note, I feel computers are crucial for enhancing our productivity and improving the quality of our life. Even so, we must not be overly dependent on them. Also, it is important to take adequate security measures to prevent the misuse of computers.",8,we-are-becoming-increasingly-dependent-on-computers-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
537,Some people think restoration of old buildings takes a huge amount of government expenditure. It would be more beneficial to use this money for development of new buildings and roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree with given statement?,"Whether the government should restore old buildings or not has always sparked a heated debate. Some people argue that instead of restoring old buildings, the government should build new roads and other structures. While I admit that restoration of ancient buildings involves a huge amount of money, spending on them is as important as building new roads and structures.
There are numerous reasons to support this view point. First of all, the old buildings depict our history and culture of people of ancient times. For example, the architecture and artistic work of old buildings are rare to find nowadays. Hence, they must be conserved. Moreover, we must preserve historical constructions for our future generations and understand that even if one piece is destroyed, it is destroyed forever. These buildings have their own character which we can’t replicate in modern architecture. Another benefit of preserving these heritage buildings is that they can be converted into tourist attractions.
However, in spite of these benefits, there are some analysts who argue that it is more important to spend money on constructing new infrastructure rather than renovate old buildings. According to them, the hard earned money they give to the government in the form of taxes must be spent on something that is beneficial to them like new roads or flyovers. Since renovations involve a huge amount of money, they feel new buildings should be constructed as per the modern architecture and needs of the society.
In conclusion, although preserving ancient buildings involves a substantial amount of money, I insist that they must be preserved because they are reminders of our culture and heritage.",8,some-people-believe-that-instead-of-renovating-old-buildings-the-government-should-build-new-infrastructure-band-8-ielts-essay-sample

Discuss both and give your opinion.","Scientists believe that earth will become uninhabitable by 2050 due to the extensive damage being done to the environment by humans. While many people believe that the fate of earth is doomed, others are of the opinion that there are still chances of reviving it, if preventive measures are taken. In this essay, I will delve into both views and provide my support for the latter view.
It is undeniably true that humans have gone too far in exploiting earth’s natural resources and many believe that it is futile to even try to save it. I believe the main reason for this thought is our inherent selfish nature. Many people would rather live comfortably utilizing all resources rather than worry about the future generation. Therefore, it is quite evident that people are not ready to come out of their comfort-zone, despite knowing that they are destroying the planet.
On the other hand, it is never too late to take steps to protect our planet from further damage. This is because there are numerous initiatives and organizations already in place waiting to get the necessary support and funds from the government and common citizens. This could be achieved by taking small steps such as placing billboards on the busiest traffic intersections or posting relevant energy conservation tips on the social media. Since a majority of the population uses subways for their daily commute, posters could be pasted on the subway walls as well. Obviously, we can do a lot if we stand united.
In conclusion, even though, it may seem like there is nothing we can do about the present state of our planet, it is never too late to take preventive measures.

539,"There is an increasing amount of advertising directed at children, which encourages them to buy goods such as toys and snacks. Many parents are worried that these advertisements put too much pressure on children while some advertisers claim that they provide useful information to children. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","It is irrefutable that advertisements have become part of our day to day lives. Some people claim that these ads share beneficial information whilst most of the parents are worried that their children are being wrongly influenced by ads. In my opinion, ads targeting kids have both positive and negative impact on them.
To begin with, parental concern about ads is justified. Young children lack the ability to make wise decisions as to what they really want. They are attracted to the colourful pictures in the advertisement and swayed by misleading information. So, they pressurize their parents to buy those things. The advertisements of fast foods are particularly bad for children.
Children cannot understand the difference between healthy food and fast food. They are attracted to the junk foods and these are very detrimental for their health. Furthermore, some ads show dangerous stunts. Although, it is clearly mentioned that the children should not imitate those stunts, they hardly read that part and try to perform those stunts and get hurt. For example, when I was a kid, I jumped from one building to the other after seeing the Thumps Up ad and ended up with a leg fracture.
On the other hand, advertisements provide necessary information to the children. For instance, the advert of Colgate toothpaste, which tells us to brush our teeth twice daily, is good for children. Then there are some ads about education like Byju’s learning application, which help children to improve their academic score and learn their subjects with better illustrations. Moreover, some advertisements also highlight the importance of saving water and electricity, keeping our surroundings clean and planting trees. Children are motivated by these ads and try to follow them.
To conclude, it is true that some ads have a detrimental effect on children, but at the same time we cannot deny the fact that there are also many advertisements that enlighten children by providing a lot of useful information.",8,there-is-an-increase-in-the-number-of-ads-targeting-children-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
540,Most artists earn low salaries and should therefore receive funding from the government in order for them to continue with their work. To what extent do you agree?,"Creative people these days receive a lot of help from companies which believe in preserving art and nature. These organisations provide financial help to any person who has genuine talent in the field of art. They even provide career opportunities to them and market their work and ideas across the world. For example, the Global Art organisation in the UK provides a medium to help people who are interested in creating new art and preserving the existing one for the society. Consequently, there is no need for the government to fund them separately.
Artists have also started receiving global recognition due to the advent of technology. The use of various visual media and advanced creative software has made it easier for them to create better design and sell them internationally. Since the financial dealing is done with people from across the world these artists can earn in international currency directly from their homes. These days, people’s love for abstract paintings and sculptures are on the rise and they can be sold to anyone by simply video conferencing with the customer anywhere. Therefore, as artists are earning in different currencies it is not necessary for the government to fund them anymore.
To conclude, there is no need for the government to support the artists financially any longer because there are many art loving organisations that willingly support them. At the same time, due to worldwide marketing they have started being recognized by many people and hence it is easier for them to sell their work.",8,more-artists-earn-low-salaries-and-hence-the-government-should-support-them-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
541,"Some people believe that individuals cannot improve environment, but only governments and big companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, environmental issues have become a major topic of discussion among people and governments. Many individuals / people argue that environmental protection can be achieved only by the governments or large business conglomerates. I strongly disagree with this opinion as small movements can have a big impact. Also any individual effort for the protection of the environment will be highly appreciated and supported by the public and this will increase the momentum.
Even though, the majority of individuals think individual efforts are useless, they have a great impact on a bigger picture. For example, in the waste management process segregating the household garbage items will take only a few minutes for the person who is sending the waste materials to the government agencies, but it provides a greater advantage for the government bodies since it is easier for them to process the properly separated waste materials. If everyone thinks that they cannot make any difference, there will not be any positive move. Therefore it is important for everyone to do whatever they can to protect the environment.
In addition, if individual efforts to protect the environment are highlighted through the proper channel, they will inspire many more people to follow the same path. For example, in 2017, Mr. Prashant, the then district collector of Kozhikode, took the personal initiative to clean a public lake in the district and he publicized / promoted the campaign on his Facebook page. After hearing about this, hundreds of local community persons joined the movement and made it a success. If that person was waiting for the government to take action, this would not happen. This clearly shows that any minor initiatives, especially for the betterment of the environment will receive a huge support from the public if we publicize it properly.
To conclude, small efforts made by the individuals for the protection of the environment certainly make a difference and encourage others also to contribute. In the light of this we can strongly oppose the given argument which underestimates individual efforts, and clearly state that individual contribution is as much important as the support provided by government bodies and multinational companies.",8,individuals-cannot-improve-environment-only-governments-and-big-companies-can-make-a-difference-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
542,The number of people who are at risk of serious health problems due to being overweight is increasing. What is the reason for the growth in overweight people in society? How can this problem be solved?,"Answer:  Recent studies have shown that the rate of obesity has increased drastically and it is leading to serious health issues. Nowadays, heart diseases and diabetes are common diseases due to this rapid increase in weight. Many factors such as a luxurious lifestyle, faulty eating habits and lack of exercise cause obesity and health problems. However, there are some solutions to these problems as well. This essay will take a look at this problem and its possible solutions.
New developments in the field of technology have made our lives easier and more comfortable. Thanks to the availability of appliances like mixer grinders and washing machines, people can get everyday tasks done with hardly any physical effort / exertion. Therefore, they are becoming overweight day by day. Moreover, people prefer to eat junk food over healthy meat, vegetables and fruits. Fast foods contain a large amount of calories which people cannot burn / use up. The reason why only a few people suffered from obesity in the past is that they used to eat low calorie healthy food and burned those calories by engaging in physical activity. Unfortunately, now most people are busy their work that they do not have time to cook proper meals at home. Consequently, they eat junk food.
On the bright side, there are some solutions to control this continuous increase in the number of overweight people. First of all, people should be encouraged to do regular exercise. This can be done by offering free gym sessions to the people who are obese and are at risk of developing serious illnesses. The government should begin awareness campaigns that guide people about the adverse effects of obesity on health and ways to fight against it.
To conclude, excessive consumption of junk food and lack of physical activity are the main causes of the increase in the incidence of obesity. Efforts should be made by the government and people themselves to control this health hazard.",8,the-number-of-obese-people-is-increasing-what-are-the-causes-of-this-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
543,"In many places, new homes are needed, but the only space available for building them is in the countryside. Some people believe it is more important to protect the countryside and not build new homes there. What is your opinion about this?","Nowadays, many hold the view that because of the land shortage in metropolises, more residential buildings should be constructed in the countryside. Others insist that protecting the countryside from excessive exploitation is even more important. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the debate before arriving at a conclusion.
To begin with, there is no doubt that due to the growth of city population and the migration of rural people into urban areas, metropolises such as Beijing and Shanghai are facing the situation of residential land scarcity. In addition, the high demand for residential buildings somehow contributes to the rise of housing price in big cities. Therefore, developing the countryside seems to be urgent. Not only can it provide people with more affordable housing, but the rural area can also benefit from the development of better infrastructure.
On the other hand, the importance of maintaining farmland / agricultural land in the countryside cannot be neglected. If excessive amount of arable land is used for residential purposes, there will be a severely negative impact on food production and supply. Moreover, farmers could be deprived of the land they live upon and this may cause social instability in the long run.
To summarize, there is no doubt that there is indeed an urgent need for building homes in the countryside. At the same time, excessive development will have a detrimental influence upon the entire human race. In the final analysis, to tackle the problem of housing shortage governments should develop the countryside in a responsible way and ensure that adequate amount of land is reserved for farming.",8,some-people-believe-that-new-homes-should-be-built-in-the-countryside-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
544,Do you think that physical activities should be introduced to school children on a regular basis? Explain. What kinds of sports are most useful?,"Today most of us live a sedentary lifestyle and therefore doing some physical activity to keep ourselves healthy is of utmost importance. In fact, in my opinion physical exercises should be introduced in schools itself. This essay will put forth some reasons to support my view.
There are many advantages to introducing physical activities at the school level. The first and the most significant benefit is the improvement in the health of students. Physical activity increases the blood circulation in the body and thus helps in the proper growth of bones and muscles. In addition to that, sports and games offer students a refreshing break from their monotonous routine of studies and homework. For example, a short recess during school hours provides students a much needed break and helps them focus properly on their lessons when the class resumes. The sports period will also help to reenergize the children.
Moreover, sports inculcate in children some life skill such as cooperation, coordination etcetera. To exemplify, playing a team sport like cricket or football helps students understand the importance of team work, coordination and cooperation. These skills will provide them a head start when they start their professional life.
Different types of sports can be incorporated by the schools depending upon the infrastructure availability. If open ground is available outdoor sports like football, hockey, volleyball and cricket can be introduced; else indoor games like chess are a good option. Playing chess develops the strategy making skill in students and other games like scramble increase the vocabulary. Thus they prove beneficial for studies too.
To conclude, sports and games are necessary for school going children and they must be made a part of the school curriculum along with other important subjects.",8,physical-activities-should-be-introduced-to-school-children-on-a-regular-basis-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
545,Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of high-school students having part-time jobs. Give reason for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.,"These days, many teenagers do part-time jobs. While part time jobs certainly offer some benefits such as financial independence and real life work experience, their drawbacks cannot be overlooked. For example, a part time job may deflect / divert children from their true career path. In this essay, I will explore both the advantages and disadvantages of part time jobs with relevant examples.
One of the significant benefits for students to have a part-time job is that they can lend a helping hand to their parents financially, or they can afford their own tuition fees for higher education. For example, most of the higher education courses, these days, are expensive, and it is a burden for parents to fund their children. Also, a part time job will give real world exposure to children. This can be an advantage when they go for higher studies. For instance, some universities prefer to admit students who have some amount of work experience.
However, there are certain drawbacks to doing a part time job. For example, children who have a part time job may lose their interest in further studies. When kids have financial freedom at such a tender, sometimes they might not take studies seriously and get deviated from their goal. Surveys have shown that about 10 percent of high school children who drop-out and discontinue higher studies, have part-time jobs.
After both sides of the argument, it is not hard to see that part time jobs certainly offer some benefits to young people; however, the drawbacks of working at a young age cannot be overlooked. Students should have a clear vision of their goals and should not neglect their studies, and understand that part-time jobs only provide temporary financial security.",8,advantages-and-disadvantages-of-part-time-jobs-for-children-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
546,"Education of young people is important in many countries. However, some people think the government should spend more money for educating the adult population who cannot read and write. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is an irrefutable fact that educating children is of utmost importance in this age of tough competition. However, a few people hold the opinion that more money should be spent on educating adults who are unable to read and write. I partially agree with the given statement. I will explain my view in this essay.
On the one hand, a country’s progress depends on the education level of the children. If more children are educated in a country that means there will be more engineers, teachers, doctors and scientists.  All these professionals will help to increase the economy of the country. So, we need to make sure that more children acquire education to secure the future of the nation.
On the other hand, adults who cannot read and write constitute a considerable proportion of our population. If money is not spent on educating them, they will not be able to earn a livelihood in this competitive world. As a result, many of them will eventually turn to crime leading to an increase in the crime rate. Therefore, it is essential that we take urgent measures and invest funds to educate these adults so that they are able to find respectable jobs for themselves. Eventually, they will be able to support the progress of the nation instead of becoming a liability.
To conclude, I believe that an equal amount of funds / money should be spent on educating children and illiterate adults because everyone’s contribution is required for the overall development of a country.",8,more-money-should-be-spent-on-adult-education-than-on-childrens-education-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
547,"Many modern children spend a great deal of time sitting in front of a television or computer screen. This is extremely harmful to their development. Therefore, parents should strictly limit the time that children spend in this way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In recent times, many teenagers are addicted to electronic gadgets which have an adverse impact /effect on their overall development. Some opine that parents should restrict the amount of time children can sit in front of these devices while others are of the opinion that children should be given a free hand. In my opinion, it is important to limit the screen time of children.
To begin with, a persons’ overall development occurs during their childhood. If a child is addicted to laptops or mobiles during this period, it will affect their physical and mental capabilities and they may end up being lethargic and stubborn. For instance, my sisters’ son is habituated to having his meals in front of the TV. He will not eat if someone switches off the television.
Adolescents need ample amount of physical and mental exercises to grow stronger and this can be achieved only if parents can restrict the usage of electronic items in everyday life by encouraging children to learn to play musical instruments or allowing them to engage in outdoor activities like playing football. Scientists have conducted various research programs across the globe and proved that children are more confident, happier and more expressive if they mingle with others of their age. On the other hand, youngsters who watch television for long hours are depressed and cannot express themselves freely in public.
To conclude, parents play a pivotal role in the upbringing of their children. Since excessive use of television or the internet can harm the normal development of children, parents must limit the screen time of their children.",8,parents-should-limit-the-time-children-can-watch-tv-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
548,Some people claim that there are more disadvantages of the car than its advantages. Do you agree or disagree? Discuss advantages and disadvantages of a car.,"Recent developments in the field of technology have revolutionized our lives tremendously. They have made our work and lifestyles easier and more luxurious than they used to be in the past.
One such invention is the motor car, which has made travelling comfortable as well as time saving. However, some people believe that owning a car has more disadvantages. The following essay takes a look at both sides of the argument. In recent years, the number of people having a private car has increased drastically. There are plenty of benefits to owning a car.
Travelling by a personal vehicle is much more comfortable and time saving than travelling by local bus and train services. Local services have many specific stops on their way to the destination which discomfort the passengers as well as consume their time. Moreover, when you travel by your own vehicle you can stop whenever you need a refreshment break during your journey. Another advantage is that people can carry as much luggage as they want while travelling in a private car.
On the other hand, there are a few drawbacks to owning a private car. Nowadays with the enhanced number of cars on the road there are more traffic jams causing long delays. Also, a continuous increase can be seen in the cost of cars and fuel prices. Smoke released from these cars worsens air pollution and in turn causes plenty of health problems.
To conclude, there are definitely many advantages and disadvantages to owning a private car; however, in my opinion, there are an equal number of disadvantages too. It is recommended that people should limit the use of private cars to only those situations when they cannot avoid it. Also, they should consider switching to cleaner sources of energy to reduce much of the pollution caused by private vehicles.",8,advantages-and-disadvantages-of-owning-a-private-car-band-8-ielts-esssy-sample
549,Rich countries should not give jobs to the skilled workers (for example doctors and engineers) of poor countries as they are needed by their home country more than rich countries. How far do you agree or disagree with the statements given?,"It is an undeniable that people tend to migrate to industrialized nations for better employment opportunities. It is also true that this phenomenon hinders the progress of their own nation in many ways. For example, it affects the availability of skilled manpower in their motherland.
The issue of brain drain has always been of paramount importance. People tend to move to the developed countries for getting a handsome salary that justifies the amount of hard work they did to earn their degrees. Actually, this prospect of settling abroad lures many students to work harder at university. For example, medical education is highly expensive and requires a great deal of hard work. If a medical student is convinced that upon completing her education she can find a lucrative job in a foreign country she will be more encouraged to put in all those efforts required to be a doctor. Moreover, when skilled professionals migrate to a developed country they will get to further enhance their skills because of the opportunity to work with some of the best minds in the world.
On the other hand, it cannot be denied that brain drain affects the quality of living in poor countries. For example, many doctors of Indian origin have moved to developed countries like the US and the UK. As a result, there is a dearth of qualified medical professionals in the country. This hurts the Indian health sector and puts the lives of many people at risk.
To conclude, there is no denying the fact the migration of skilled human resources to developed countries hurt the overall progress of their mother country. Even so, in my opinion, people should have the right to decide where they want to work and live. Actually, developing countries can discourage this practice by providing better opportunities in their country.",8,rich-countries-should-not-give-jobs-to-skilled-workers-from-poor-countries-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
550,Some sports are extremely dangerous but many people still like them very much. Why do people take part in dangerous sports? Give some suggestions on how to deal with these dangers.,"It is true that countless individuals are eager to participate in adventurous sports even though they are aware of the dangers involved. There are various reasons for this; however, certain safety measures, if adopted and followed, can mitigate the dangers associated with these sports.
To begin with, one of the predominant reasons for the popularity of some dangerous sports such as paragliding, bungee jumping and scuba diving is that people tend to take part in these sports to overcome and conquer their phobias and fears. Many people suffer from aqua phobia and acrophobia, and to free themselves from these phobias, they indulge in some adventurous yet life-threatening sports. These sports, they believe, will boost their confidence and make the intrepid.  To exemplify this, I was extremely afraid of heights but to overcome this fear, I did paragliding not only once but thrice in a row on the same day even though I was aware of the risks involved. I am no longer afraid of tall buildings and extreme heights. Moreover, people have thrilling and exhilarating experience after doing these sports. They feel more alive and younger.
To mitigate the dangers involved in these sports, the most effective measure is to use proper safety gears and equipments such as harness, ropes and specialized clothing. Before doing the sport, the participants should be checked thoroughly to ensure that their specialized safety kit and gear is functioning properly. This practice, therefore, would reduce the risks involved. In addition to what has been mentioned, the specialists and experienced professionals should provide 1-2 days training to interested participants to avoid any dangers. For example, before doing sky-diving, the professionals provide 2 days coaching to the people who are going to take part in it. Moreover, participating in these hazardous sports must be avoided in extreme weather conditions, such as raining and thunderstorms.
In conclusion, from a quick analysis of the situation, it is quite evident that people are inclined towards the perilous sports as it helps them to conquer their fears. Undoubtedly, the dangers associated with these sports can be significantly reduced by taking the safety measures mentioned above.",8,why-do-people-take-part-in-dangerous-sports-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
551,Today the internet has replaced traditional books as a source of information. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this development.,"The internet plays a vital role in storing and disseminating information. Some people assert that before long it will replace books. The positive and negative aspects of this development will be discussed in this essay.
The internet has made it easy to find information. Any information that we need is now available at the click of a button. The internet has also made traditional sources of information such as books redundant. Nowadays people do not have to carry bulky paper books in their back pack. Instead, they can store ebooks on their laptop, Kindle or smartphone. There are obvious benefits to this. eBooks do not occupy space. They are much less expensive than printed books and can be shared with anyone within a fraction of seconds.
On the flip side, if books get completely replaced by the internet or eBooks, a few negative things may also happen. To start with, reading an eBook for hours on end can strain the eyes. People who constantly stare at a screen may also develop other health problems like neck pain and back pain. A paper book, by contrast, can be read for any length of time without experiencing any of these difficulties. Another drawback of internet based sources of information is that they are not always available. We need an internet connection and a supporting device to be able to access them. Because of this reason, the internet is not a good companion when we travel. Paper books, on the other hand, make excellent travel buddies. Another downside of the internet is that information available on it is not always reliable.
To conclude, the internet is certainly replacing paper books and the sale of eBooks is soaring; however, I do not believe that books will be completely out of fashion because of their inherent advantages that eBooks lack.",8,the-internet-has-replaced-traditional-books-as-sources-of-information-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
552,Children learn by observing the behavior of adults and copying it. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Children mirror the behavior of adults that they are exposed to. Therefore I completely agree with the statement that children are impressionable and learn from adult behavior patterns that they see.
Children are akin to clean slates with a minimal inherent / inborn understanding of what is right or wrong.  They are also keen observers of the environment around them. As such, any activity performed by an adult in their vicinity becomes a lesson that they imbibe. And this absorption of one’s surroundings often happens without filters and without a complete understanding of its implications. For example, if a child observes an adult being physically abusive to another person, then the child normalizes physical abuse and may become abusive to their peers. The child does not, on their own rationalize the merits and demerits of violence and simply apes the adult’s behaviour. This is why it is imperative that adults in a child’s life, be they the parents, uncles, aunts or grandparents inculcate a sense of good and bad in the child; they should help the child distinguish good behaviour from bad and replicate only what is acceptable.
Copying an adult’s behavior also has implications for the child’s future life. Their habits, likes and dislikes, and overall personality are shaped by what they see and learn during their early life. If a child observes adults around them being lazy and unhealthy, the child subconsciously imbibes this and implements it in their life. Conversely, a child observing active and healthy adults around them are more likely to lead a healthier life in the future because they  wire themselves to be so.
Thus, children exposed to a multitude of different behavior by adults tend to copy them and in turn mould their own future personalities. The onus, however, is on the adults to serve as an example that they’ll be proud of when the child eventually mirrors them.",8,children-learn-by-observing-the-behaviour-of-adults-and-copying-it-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
553,Some people think that it would be better for large companies and industries to move to regional areas outside large urban centers. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"According to some people bigger companies and industrial sectors should be moved to the rural areas. In my opinion, the benefits of this proposition outnumber the drawbacks.
One significant advantage of moving industries to regional areas is the significant decrease in air, water and noise pollution.  In other words, companies and industries produce a lot of by-products as waste. Their proper disposal requires a lot of space which is not readily available in cities. So, if companies are situated in urban areas, they will not be able to treat the waste properly because of space constraints. This will cause pollution in the cities. Since population density in cities is very high, the pollution will affect a lot of people. Since rural areas are less populated, more free space is available there for treating industrial waste. In other words, moving industries to the countryside is a great way to reduce pollution.
Nonetheless, there is a major drawback to moving industries and companies to the suburbs. Industries and companies give employment to many people around the area. If they shift to a farther location, it will lead to unemployment in cities. On the bright side, it will also encourage more people to move to the countryside. Another disadvantage of shifting industries to the suburbs is the decline in productivity because of the delay in getting raw materials. However, with proper planning, these problems can be resolved to a great extent.
To conclude, there are definitely a few disadvantages to moving industries to the countryside – it may create unemployment in cities; however, in my opinion, this move will also make cities cleaner and less congested because it will encourage more people to move to the suburbs.",8,industries-should-be-moved-to-rural-areas-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
554,"It is no longer necessary to use animals for food, clothing or medical research. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, animals are widely used in many areas. Some people think it will be unnecessary to use them in the near future. I disagree with this idea to a certain extent. While it is true that animal products can be replaced by synthetic products in the clothing industry, humans will still need animals for food and medical research.
We do find a lot of ways to avoid using animals. First many types of alternative foods, invented by scientists, taste like meat but are made of soybeans. So people who eat these fake meat dishes can remain vegetarians and still get all the nutrients they need. Using animals for medical research is indeed cruel and immoral. After all, we do not have the right to kill other forms of life for our benefit. Fortunately, the use of animals in medical research and trials is decreasing rapidly. In the clothing industry, also, it is now possible to avoid using animals. For example, synthetic fur and synthetic silk look as good as the real thing and their production does not involve any cruelty to animals.
Even so, it is nearly impossible to stop using animals altogether. For example, fish and meat are an integral part of many cuisines around the world. They are major sources of vitamins, minerals and proteins. Meat substitutes are usually expensive and hard to find in many markets. So, if people are told to stop using animal products, they may fail to get adequate nutrition. Likewise, it is impossible to perform medical research without using animals. Of course, this practice is unethical and scientists are working hard to minimise the use of animals, yet there is no justification for stopping the production of some crucial drugs just because their testing involves animals.
In summary, we need to respect animals’ right to live and reduce their use for purposes of vanity; however we cannot avoid using them for meeting our nutritional requirements or performing medical research.",8,it-is-no-longer-necessary-to-use-animals-for-food-clothing-or-medical-research-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
555,Some people prefer to eat at food stalls or restaurants other people prefer to prepare food at home. Which type of food do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"Food is very important for the survival of human beings. Food preferences vary from person to person. While some prefer to eat readymade food, others insist on cooking and eating food at home. I would like to have homemade food rather than outside food. This essay will discuss various reasons to advocate my view.
To begin with, there are many reasons why I give more preference to food made at home.  First and foremost, the homemade food is healthier than readymade food. It is full of vitamins, healthy carbohydrates and proteins which make you feel energetic and full for longer time. The majority of restaurants use myriads of taste enhancers and additives to make the food delicious. These taste makers can affect human nervous system and their regular consumption can cause various diseases. Furthermore, preparing food at home is cheaper than buying it from market; you do not need to pay extra taxes and service charges while eating at home.
Another reason why I do not like outside food is that it is not very hygienic. The food at stalls is very unhygienic. Take Indian street food, for example. It is delicious but it is sold on streets without proper care and cover. Moreover, street food does not meet the) standards of food safety guidelines.
On the other hand, when it comes to homemade food, we can prepare it according to our needs. For example, someone who is ill needs a special diet of light food rich in nutrients.  Such requirements can only be fulfilled at home.
To conclude, where a person prefers to eat depends on their choices and requirements. Different people have different choices and preferences but I prefer to eat at home because homemade food is healthy and unhygienic.",8,some-people-prefer-to-eat-at-food-stalls-or-restaurants-other-people-prefer-to-prepare-food-at-home-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
556,"Nowadays, more and more foreign students are going to English-Speaking countries to learn the “international language – English”. It is undoubtedly true that studying English in an English-speaking country is the best way, but it is not the only way to learn it. Do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","No doubt, English is the most significant international language in the world. While some people believe that the best way for non-native students to learn this language is to travel to English-speaking countries, I argue that learning English while staying in one’s own country is a more practical and feasible approach.
Those who support the view that flying to English speaking countries is the best way to learn English probably think so because of the opportunity it provides to learn from native teachers and fellow students.  For example, if students travel to Australia to improve their English language skills, they will get to learn from native English teachers. As English is their mother tongue they are experts of accent and other nuances of the language. Also, the students will get better opportunities to interact with peers who are native speakers. As a result, it would be easier for them to get a command of the language)
However, I believe that the above system has many limitations and it is not a practical way of learning for the majority of non-English speakers. Firstly, travelling from one country to another country needs a lot of money. However, the majority of non-native English learners are from the developing and under developed nations and they cannot afford to spend so much money for learning a language. Moreover, there is no real point in gaining such mastery over the language, as language skills alone will not get one a good job.
What’s more the rise in internet access and international tourism has provided various options to learn any foreign language from any place. This is because plenty of in-depth tutorials are available online from the native speakers, that too at very affordable cost. Also, social networking provides ample opportunities to interact with people from the other nations. Furthermore, nowadays, there are international schools in almost all the countries where native tutors are available, in case someone wants to get classroom learning.
In conclusion, although travelling to English speaking countries for learning English provides an ‘easy to learn’ atmosphere for learners, it comes at a huge cost and hence in my opinion, it is not a feasible option at least for the majority of learners from the developing world.",8,travelling-to-an-english-speaking-country-is-the-only-way-to-learn-english-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
557,Some people think that books are losing importance as a source of information and entertainment. To what extent do you agree?,"Books have been a great source of information and entertainment since ages. However, in recent times, books are thought to be losing their importance. I agree with this view and in this essay I will explain how the availability of information on the internet and the aggressive growth of visual media have threatened the very existence of printed books.
To begin with, thanks to the advent of the internet, all the information is now available at the click of a button. For example, if we need information on a particular topic, we only have to Google it and it is available for free. Thus people tend to search information online rather than spending money on books which are often expensive. Also, finding information from a book often takes a lot of time. Hence it is evident that the popularity of books is decreasing.
Additionally, there has been a dramatic growth in the popularity and reach of visual media which provide different types of entertainment. For instance, people these days switch on their television during their free time. They no longer read a book to relax their mind. The internet also provides a lot of entertainment material and even smart phones have access to the internet these days. Therefore, the demand for books as a source of entertainment has reduced considerably.
In conclusion, I would say that though books are a great source of information and entertainment, people, nowadays, have access to alternative means of entertainment and faster and more convenient sources of information. Consequently, books are losing their readers.",8,books-are-losing-importance-as-a-source-of-information-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
558,Nowadays food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Give reasons for your answer using your own ideas and experience.,"The advent of technology has had a tremendous impact on our day to day life. For example, we now have several home appliances that make it easy to cook food. However, in my opinion, this ease of cooking food can have both positive and negative impacts.
The biggest advantage of this change is that people can save the time and energy required to prepare meals. In other words, they no longer have to spend the entire day in the kitchen. For example, home appliances like refrigerators, mixer grinders and microwave oven have even enabled many women to go out to work because they have plenty of free time on their hand. Also when food can be cooked in a matter of minutes even the busiest of people can eat proper meals.
However, there is a downside to it. Often times, easily prepared food is not very healthy. For example, many people have the habit of cooking huge amounts of food. They store the excess food in the refrigerator and subsist on it for days. When it is time to have a meal, they just take the food out of the refrigerator and heat it. The leftover is again stashed in the fridge. While the refrigerator may prevent the food from going stale, the nutritional value is definitely lost. Regular consumption of refrigerated food can have a negative impact on the health of people. There are also many concerns about the safety of food cooked in microwave ovens.
To conclude, there are certainly many advantages to being able to cook food easily. However, easily cooked food may lack in nutrients or cause health problems. Even so, the ease of cooking has generally had a positive impact on the day to day life of people.",8,food-has-become-easier-to-cook-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
559,"Some schools are very strict about their school uniforms and the appearance of their pupils, while other schools have a very relaxed dress code. What are the advantages and disadvantages of children of having a school uniform?","Many educational institutes have firm guidelines regarding school uniform and the appearance of their pupils, whereas some schools allow their students to wear what they like. Although having a strict dress code protects students from many forms of on-campus bullying and creates a sense of equality, it also interferes with their creativity and self expression and thus causes resentment among them.
One obvious benefit of having a strict dress code is that it reduces the on-campus violence and bullying. Moreover, the school uniform promotes the school spirit in students and eases the morning routine for both children and parents. Clothes are often considered as a status symbol. Consequently, many well-off students who wear designer garments make fun of their poor classmates who cannot afford the newest fashion clothing. School uniforms put everyone on a level playing field and prevent this type of bullying. What’s more, if you know exactly what you are wearing to school, you can get ready in much less time. Furthermore, if every student wears the same school colours and mascots every day, they develop a sense of unity and togetherness.
On the other hand, there are a few disadvantages to having a strict dress code at school. Firstly, clothing is a great way for students to express who they are and their personal style every day. Having a strict dress code means they cannot wear the dress of their choice and this can make them feel like they are being oppressed. Secondly, the majority of students don’t want to wear uniforms and when they feel that they are being forced to wear uniforms, they begin to resent the school and administration.
In conclusion, while there are a few drawbacks to having a strict dress code in schools, in my opinion, uniforms help create a friendly and positive environment at school and promote equality and togetherness.",8,some-schools-are-strict-about-their-dress-code-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
560,"It is a common aspiration among people to run their own business, rather that work for an employer. Do you think the advantages outweigh disadvantages?","It is commonly seen that people aspire to start and run their own business, instead of pursuing a job. In my opinion, the benefits of running a business far outweigh the problems associated with it.
Admittedly, there are some minor disadvantages to owning a business. Firstly, starting your own business generally requires an initial investment. For example, the owner of the business might need to invest in machineries and buildings to start a business. However, the problem is that everyone is not affluent enough to invest a large amount of money. Secondly, running a business always involves a certain amount of risk. There is no fixed monthly income from a business; it could even incur losses if it is not managed appropriately. In short, a business can be a burden if it is not managed and monitored properly.
Nevertheless, despite the disadvantages mentioned above, I believe there are a lot of significant advantages to owning a business. One of the obvious benefits is that the business owner has complete authority over any decision related to the business. For instance, a restaurant owner can take the decision to open a new branch to expand the business whenever required. In comparison, most of the employees working in a company do not have much say in the functioning of the company. Another advantage of owning is a business is that business owners can increase their revenues and profits manifold when the business grows. In other words, people can earn more by running a successful business. Finally, a successful business acts as a launch pad for the children from business families to start their career. Clearly, owning a business can be immensely beneficial for people.
In conclusion, while there are minor disadvantages to running a business, I believe the benefits are greater than the problems associated with it. In fact, the potential problems can be mitigated by taking appropriate measures and monitoring progress.",8,do-the-advantages-of-running-a-business-outweigh-the-disadvantages-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
561,"Health care should not be provided for free regardless of a person’s income. The health of a person is in their own hands and they should, therefore, be held accountable for that. Do you agree with this opinion?","Many people hold the opinion that health subsidies should not be given to citizens irrespective of their financial status, but I disagree with that. No doubt, everyone is responsible for keeping themselves fit but it is the government’s responsibility as well to ensure their citizens are entitled to have medical benefits.
Recent changes in lifestyle have had adverse effects on people’s health. Also jobs in metros are so demanding that people are unable to pay attention to their mental and physical fitness. Because of this reason, the government should ensure that its citizens have easy access to cheap and quality healthcare. By providing free health care, the government can also earn the trust and loyalty of its people.
Another factor that explains why we need health care subsidies is the proportion of people living below the poverty line. In many developing countries poverty index is quite high and people cannot even afford basic medication. They are largely dependent on government agencies for assistance when they develop a health problem. Lastly, it is clearly evident that our generation has considerably low immunity levels because of the low quality of the food we eat. These days, fruits, vegetables and grains are treated with pesticides which reduce their nutrient value. Also, food available outside is mostly of low quality. These factors also lead to an unhealthy society.
To conclude, it is imperative that we keep ourselves fit and healthy by eating quality foods and leading an active lifestyle. This, however, does not mean that the government has no responsibility towards building a healthy society. It should contribute its bit by providing subsidised or free health care.",8,some-people-argue-that-healthcare-should-not-be-provided-for-free-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
562,Many people believe that social networking sites such as Facebook have had a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extent do you agree?,"Recently, the use of social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter has increased significantly. While some people think that they have negatively impacted  both people and  society, I only partially agree with the statement. In my opinion, the use of social networking sites has both positive and negative aspects to it.
Although social networking sites are often criticised, their positive impacts on the individuals and the society cannot be ignored. They help people to quickly and conveniently connect with those living miles away. With the availability of these sites, it is easy to remain updated with the latest developments in the lives of friends and relatives. Also, they eliminate the need to call and inform hundreds of people when something important occurs in your life. You only have to post it on your social profile and everyone in your circle of friends is automatically informed. Moreover, using social media people can learn about the latest fashion trends. Therefore, there are definitely some advantages to using social networking sites.
At the same time, there are numerous drawbacks to excessive use of these websites. Often most people using these become so addicted to these sites that they tend to neglect other important aspects of their lives. Even though these portals are connecting people staying in far flung places, those staying close-by tend to grow apart emotionally. In addition, most people have stopped calling / visiting their near and dear ones and instead prefer to to stay connected through these online sites. This has also resulted in the weakening of bonds between individuals. Furthermore, often these sites encourage unhealthy competition and lead to low confidence levels in users. Therefore, excessive use of these sites is likely to produce societies consisting of individuals who lack face to face social skills and who have low confidence levels.
To conclude, in my perspective, usage of social networking sites has both benefits and drawbacks. To minimize their possible negative impacts, their use should be kept minimal and these sites should not be allowed to take precedence over face to face or other forms of interaction between individuals.",8,social-networking-sites-like-facebook-have-a-negative-impact-on-the-society-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
563,"Nowadays, people move from one country to another for finding jobs. Some people think children of these families suffer because of this while others think it is helpful for them. Discuss both views and give your opinion?","When people migrate from one country to another in search of better jobs, some believe that their children are the most effected ones, while others say that the effect on children is minimal and in fact they can take advantage of all the facilities available there which will eventually help them to have a better life. In my opinion, children are easily adaptable to changes and even though it seems to be a big change for them initially, in the long run it will help them to have a better life.
Of course children are affected when they move to another country. For them, it is a completely new world. At a very young age, friends and family are the most influential people in their life. They have to leave behind all the friends that they have made over the years and start afresh. Educational system might not be the same in the new environment. They might need to learn new subjects or take extra effort to catch up with their peers. For example, the medium of communication might be different and there will be a lot of pressure on them to learn them quickly. They might even face some discrimination, whether it is racial or of some other kind. All of these will affect their young mind and may even make them feel depressed.
However, in my opinion, these changes will not have any lasting negative impact on children. Children can adapt to new situations fairly easily and quickly. They get along with the changes very fast. Even if they find some road blocks in the initial days, with the help and support of their parents they will be able to overcome them. This will also make them capable of facing any adversities in a composed manner in future. In that way, it will be a great experience for them. We should not also forget the fact that the new facilities and opportunities that they will get in the new place will eventually help to bring the best out of them.
To conclude, after analysing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that moving to another country is unlikely to have any major negative impact on children. Actually, they are more likely to benefit because of the better opportunities available in their adopted country.",8,when-parents-move-to-another-country-their-children-are-affected-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
564,"Students are becoming more and more reliant on computers. What are some of the problems associated with reliance on computers, and what are some of the possible solutions?","Students’ dependence on laptops and computers has increased dramatically in recent years. Over dependence on computers has raised many questions/concerns. For example, this has reduced human interactions and affected critical thinking skills in children. This essay will analyse these issues in detail and suggest ways to address them.
On the one hand, interactions among people have reduced because of computers. Learners have been using social media such as Facebook and Whatsapp to communicate with unfamiliar people. Virtual interactions cannot be a substitute for face to face interactions between chat bots / communication tools cannot express emotions.
For example, my brother uses social media to chat with his friends without spending adequate time with the family members. This has led to certain behavioural changes in him and he now shies away from spending time with his loved ones. Another disadvantage of overuse of computers is that students no longer remember facts or figures. They can find every bit of information online. They do not even learn spellings because word processing software programmes come with spell checkers. Unfortunately, this dependence on computers hurt the memory and reasoning skills of students.
However, good parenting can prevent these problems to a great extent. The father and the mother know their children better than anyone and they can restrict the use of laptops or mobile computers. Time spend on social media has to be limited by uninstalling communication software from the laptops and mobile phones. Additionally parents can approach councillors who can help children if they are unable to overcome their addiction to computers.
In conclusion, while computers are useful for students, their overuse can cause many problems and hence cannot be recommended. Parental supervision can play an important role in preventing children from becoming addicted to computers.",8,students-are-becoming-more-and-more-reliant-on-computers-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
565,"Economic growth and development are usually considered to be beneficial both for individuals and for society as a whole.
What are some advantages and disadvantages of economic development?","There is no doubt that economic growth and advancement benefit both the citizens and the society. However, like most other scenarios where good things are associated with a few bad impacts, this development also has some disadvantages. In this essay, I’m going to discuss the positive and negative aspects of this economic development.
Firstly, economic development offers lots of benefits to people. This development generates more jobs for the people and improves their standard of living. For example, with the establishment of industries like pulp, car manufacturing etc., more opportunities have arisen for both skilled and unskilled workers resulting in a stable progress of all sections of the society. By contrast, stress levels also increase when competition for jobs heats up. Consider the IT and manufacturing industries which play a key role in economic growth. Unfortunately, because of the cut throat competition existing in these fields many employees report work related anxieties and health problems.
Economic development benefits the society as well. As the development advances, infrastructure and facilities for the public improve. For example, better health care is provided for people resulting in an increase in the average life expectancy of the society.
Despite these positives, economic development has a number of downsides as well. For ex-ample, as earnings increase, the number of people owning cars also increases. This leads to traffic congestion in cities and makes traveling difficult. Economic development also leads to pollution. Industrial waste is another byproduct of economic development. Factories dump their waste into marine bodies like seas, rivers and lakes and thus impact marine life and reduce groundwater quality.
In conclusion, economic development leads to more job opportunities for people and better infra-structure and facilities. However, development can also damage the environment and increase the stress levels of people.",8,economic-growth-is-beneficial-for-people-and-societies-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
566,"It is often said “when in Rome, do as the Romans do”. Do you think people should adapt and accept the culture of the country they visit? Do you think it is possible to learn a culture without learning the language?","Some people believe that tourists visiting another country ought to adapt to its local culture. I certainly agree with this view as following local culture shows respect towards it. Also, I believe that people can’t gain deeper understanding of foreign cultures without learning the native languages.
International tourists must accustom themselves to the culture of the country which they are visiting. When tourists adapt to the local culture of a country, it shows their respect towards that culture and the people. If local customs and traditions are not followed and adopted by overseas tourists, it can lead to friction between the tourists and locals. For instance, overseas women visiting Saudi Arabia are necessarily required to wear “Abaya”, a traditional costume for Muslim women. Women tourists can land themselves in difficulty if they do not adhere to this custom in Saudi Arabia. In short, when visitors honour the local traditions of the place they visit, they are actually saving themselves a lot of trouble.
As for the importance of learning the local language, in my opinion, it is impossible to gain deeper understanding of any culture without learning the native language. Language is not only a means of communication; it is also deeply related to the culture. In other words, language is a fundamental element of any culture. If a person lacks knowledge of a language they will be not be able to access the folklore and literature available in that language. This, in turn, will hinder their understanding of that culture. Furthermore, people are the representatives of a culture and it is impossible to understand a culture without interacting with the locals. For this purpose also a foreigner has to learn the local language. Therefore, language plays a crucial role in promoting cultural understanding.
In conclusion, foreign tourists must accept and follow the native culture of the country they visit as it is an act of paying respect to their culture. Regarding language,  it is deeply connected to the culture and should definitely be learned in order to understand the culture.",8,do-you-think-people-should-adapt-and-accept-the-culture-of-the-country-they-visit-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
567,Solar energy is becoming more and more popular as a source of household energy in many countries around the world. Why is this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy?,"Various countries across the world have started using solar power for domestic purpose because it is the most abundant renewable resource of energy. Although solar energy is eco-friendly and inexhaustible, it does have a few drawbacks.
The popularity of solar energy can be attributed to the fact that it does not cause global warming like fossil fuels. Also, natural resources like petrol, tar and fuels are limited and cannot meet the increasing demand for energy. Consequently, scientists all over the world are researching alternative sources like sun and wind.
Firstly, one of the benefits of solar power as already mentioned is its abundant availability, especially in tropical countries. In other words, sun is a natural source of heat and hence there is no danger of depletion, whereas, other sources of energy are already exhausted. Secondly, solar energy does not cause pollution since it does not involve the combustion of fuels and hence helps to tackle global warming.
Nevertheless, solar energy has its own limitations which restrict its widespread usage. The main drawback is that the solar panels which are required to extract solar energy are very expensive and cannot be afforded by people from low income groups. Also the panels are quite huge and occupy a lot of space and hence many people are reluctant to use them. Another disadvantage is that since solar power needs sunshine, it cannot be relied upon as the only source of energy in many subtropical and temperate countries where it is winter for most parts of the year.
To conclude, solar is becoming more and more popular as a source of energy because it is abundant, clean and green. However, it does have some disadvantages which discourage its widespread use.",8,solar-energy-is-becoming-more-and-more-popular-as-a-source-of-household-energy-in-many-countries-around-the-world-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
568,"Some people think that to learn about other countries, they need to travel. Some say that it is not necessary to travel; we can have information through TV and internet. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some people opine that in order to gain information about a foreign land, it is necessary to travel. Others refute this idea and I agree with them. In my opinion, it is possible to gather information without traveling. Having said that, there are some other advantages to traveling.
While in my opinion one does not have to travel to find information about other countries, traveling certainly has some other benefits. To start with, it enables us to immerse ourselves in the culture of the country. On TV and the internet we can watch how foreigners celebrate their festivals but if we travel to those countries we will also get an opportunity to celebrate those festivals with the locals. The experiences are totally different. Likewise, when we travel they can taste foreign cuisine. Traveling also gives us opportunities to improve our communication skills.
On the other hand, information about other countries can be obtained without travelling through online sources such as the internet, TV and mobile phones. Information technology has provided us numerous tools to access the internet and these tools deliver everything we want to learn / discover about other nations. Earlier we had little information about foreign lands, their people and their culture, but now it is even possible to make friends with them without having to leave our country. People can even earn foreign degrees from their home by joining the online courses of international universities. Thus, nowadays, there are numerous opportunities to acquire knowledge and information without traveling.
To sum up, there is no need to travel to find information about other countries.

Do you agree or disagree with this view?","Some people believe that future of cinema is doomed and that the audience will eventually get bored of the silver screen and stop watching movies and shows in cinemas. However, in my opinion, the future of cinema is bright and it will continue to entertain people for a long time.
Firstly, the reason I believe that cinema will not lose its shine is that cinema is evolving continuously to satisfy the needs of the audience. New technologies like 3D view and special effects are liked by people. For example, movies with special effects have become extremely popular and earn much more revenue than movies without them. Additionally, the quality of camera, theater and movie set has increased many folds in last three decades. Consequently, number of people visiting cinema has also increased.
Secondly, cinema will continue to entertain people because there are no strong competitors present that can compete with it in terms of entertainment. In the absence of any strong opposition, cinema continues to rule people’s heart. For instance, movies are making more money than ever and their revenues are crossing billions of dollars. Film industry also expanded its reach during the last five years. While several other sources of entertainment are present today like video games and social media, they cannot be considered as replacement of cinema as their way of entertainment is very different and is not liked by everybody.
In conclusion, although cinema has been entertaining people for more than a century, there is no evidence that its popularity is declining among people.

Some people argue that it is necessary for economic growth, while others claim that it damages local industries. Discuss both points and give your opinion.","Globalization of trade has been a controversial topic for a long time. Although some people believe that it is essential for growth and development, others argue that it has an adverse effect on local industries. In my opinion, the flow of goods across countries is crucial for economic development.
On the one hand, globalization is considered as a necessity for the growth of world economy. Firstly, it promotes rapid development of goods with better quality. Different countries excel in the production of different goods and because of globalization they are able to share the finished products with the rest of the world. Secondly, it helps in producing cheaper goods. Market size has changed from local size to international size which helps manufacturers to produce goods in huge quantity and hence at cheaper prices / rates. Additionally, it makes resources available across the planet. For example, countries like Saudi Arabia import all the food products from other countries as their land is unfit to support the vegetation and export crude oil to other countries.
On the other hand, people are against international brands because it creates a lot of competition for small brands operating in a limited area. For example, with the arrival of international shoe sellers, local manufacturers are facing trouble in selling their products. Additionally, international brands are much cheaper than local brands. Consequently, local shopkeepers struggle hard to sell their products against their cheaper counterparts. This may also lead to poor economy growth for countries that import much more than they export.
In conclusion, while globalization may have a negative impact on local businessmen, it is necessary as it promotes the development of technology and world economy.",8,the-free-movement-of-goods-across-national-borders-has-long-been-a-controversial-issue-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
571,Forests are the lungs of the earth. Destruction of the world’s forests can result in the death of the world we currently know. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Forests are an integral part of the planet earth and they are like lungs of it, as they help the planet to breathe properly. Therefore I am in consummate accord with this statement and in my opinion deforestation will eventually lead to the end of many species on earth.
Forests keep ecological balance intact and help the survival of numerous species including human beings. They have an impact on climate and weather conditions. Trees in forests help to purify the air by taking CO2 and releasing oxygen. They provide shelter to several animals during all seasons like hot summer and heavy rainy season. They play a key role in maintaining the temperatures balanced. If the planet has trees in abundance, the change of seasons will occur naturally.
On the flip side, deforestation leads to irreparable damage and severe /disastrous consequences. More and more trees are being cut down to accommodate the needs of the growing population. This in turn is impacting the earth in a very undesirable manner. For instance, the increased pace of deforestation accelerates global warming and results in the melting of polar ice. Uncontrolled cutting of trees also leads to air pollution. If trees are cut, the air does not get purified and the polluted air becomes a major health hazard for all living beings. Many animals and birds have already lost their habitats and are facing extinction. As forests are destroyed, the rare herbs and medicines found in them also get destroyed.
In conclusion, forests play a key role in the survival of life on the earth and excessive deforestation will wreak havoc and lead to the loss of most of the species and ultimately the end of life on the planet.",8,forests-are-the-lungs-of-the-earth-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
572,Some think spending a lot on birthday celebration and weddings is a waste of money. Others think that it is important for young people and society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"People’s opinions seem to differ on whether spending money lavishly on celebrations and special occasions is a positive trend or a mere wastage of money. While some seem to agree with the argument that it is necessary for the society, I believe that such unmindful spending should rather be avoided.
To begin with, there are myriad reasons to argue that spending loads of money on weddings and other special occasions is quite unnecessary. Firstly, in most of today’s celebrations there is a deliberate show of power and easy money. Such extensive celebrations are no better than pomp shows. Secondly, instead of spending huge amounts of money on any celebration, it is better to save it and later invest it in better ways. For instance, instead of spending lots of money on a child’s first birthday party in a five-star hotel, it is better to save it for his/her higher education. Furthermore, sometimes spending on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries and housewarming also become a social obligation for many people and they give in to the societal pressure spending their hard-earned money.
On the other hand, people who argue that it is imperative to have grand celebrations opine / insist that it is a way of enjoying life with their family and friends. They feel that such celebrations are part of their customs and traditions. While this may be true to a certain extent, in my opinion, there is no need to spend truck loads of money on celebrations. For example, a birthday party held at home can be as enjoyable as the one held at a five star hotel and yet it costs much less.
To conclude, I feel that unmindful spending on any occasion can be avoided. Instead that money should be saved or used in a better way.",8,some-think-spending-a-lot-on-birthday-celebration-and-weddings-is-a-waste-of-money-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
573,"Some people feel that boarding schools (where students or pupils live at the school during the term) are an excellent option for children, while other people disagree for a number of reasons. Consider both sides of this debate and reach a conclusion.","While some people believe that boarding schools are an outstanding option for children, others disagree with this view. This essay will look into both sides of the argument and reach a logical conclusion.
On the one hand, those who argue that boarding schools are a better option for children claim that children can easily learn discipline at the boarding, and it is the best place to gain academic qualifications. It is well-known that many boarding schools have a set of strict morning and night routines which children must obey and follow.
For instance, they have to exercise for an hour in the morning. No electronic devices are permitted on the campus and no lights are allowed after a certain hour in the night. These strict routines and rules teach children discipline. For these reasons some people advise that boarding schools are the best places for children to study.
Conversely, those who argue against sending children to boarding claim that parents will lose control over their children. Children spend most of their time in boarding schools; therefore, parents will have no way of knowing what is happening in their children’s daily life. For example, parents have no way to find whether their children are being bullied at school. This level of distance between children and their parents is an unhealthy way of raising a child.
In conclusion, it seems boarding schools can be a better option for children to learn discipline. However, it is not an excellent option because it affects the relation between parents and children, and it does not give a chance to parents to monitor their children on daily basis.",8,some-people-feel-that-boarding-schools-are-an-excellent-option-for-children-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
574,"Nowadays, many families have both parents working. Some working parents believe other family members like grandparents can take care of their children, while others think child care centres provide the best care. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Currently, many parents tend to be busy working and they have to rely on someone else to look after their children. While some people think childcare organisations can offer the best care, in my perspective, it is better for children to be looked after by their grandparents.
On the one hand, some parents believe that children should be sent to child care centres for some reasons. The first reason is that these centres are professional organisations and their staff are well trained so they have good babysitting skills. For example, when a child falls over and gets himself injured, the well trained staff in the care centres will act quickly and give first aid. Furthermore, child care organisations have many children from different backgrounds. This helps children mingle with them and make friends with their peers which might increase their communication and language abilities.
On the other hand, I believe it is a better idea for grandparents to take care of their grandchildren. Firstly, grandparents are well experienced in raising children because they have brought up their own children. For example, they know how to calm down children when they cry. Secondly, grandparents are family members, so they love their grandchildren more than other people do. As a result, they tend to spend more time and take more effort to care for their grandchildren. This is not exactly possible in day care centres because they have to take care of several kids at the same time. Consequently, there is a limit to the attention they can give to each child. Another advantage of leaving children in the care of their grandparents is that they are more likely to be family oriented when they grow up. Also, children raised by grandparents pick up family values much faster.
In conclusion, while there are some benefits to sending children to child care centres, I believe they should be raised by their own grandparents because they can give much more love and attention than care takers at day care centres.",8,some-working-parents-think-children-should-be-sent-to-child-care-centres-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
575,"Nowadays celebrities are mainly famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree and disagree?","Nowadays, some of the most famous people in the world are mainly known for their material possessions and image and they can have a negative influence on young people. While I admit that many famous people are popular only for their riches and looks, I do not agree with the argument that all celebrities are bad role models for the society as some of them they can be extremely inspirational for teenagers because of their hard work and lifestyle.
On the one hand, there are many artists who are famous only for being rich and attractive and their behaviour often has an adverse influence on teenagers. They send out the message that in order to be famous, you only have to be rich and beautiful. There are also some who do not mind engaging in acts that are typically considered disgraceful only to grab eyeballs. A typical example of this is Paris Hilton who is famous for being a rich celebrity. She often posts glamorous photos and videos of her wearing designer costumes. She is also often spotted drinking and smoking. This glamorous and lusty lifestyle can often influence teenagers in a negative way. They only see the superficial side of fame and do not understand or appreciate the efforts that go into making one successful.
On the other hand, there are some celebrities who can be a positive role model for young adults. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the highest-paid football players in the world because of his determination, talent, and hard work. In fact, he is constantly training and working in order to build his stamina and endurance, aiming to give his best on the field. Therefore, he is extremely inspirational for children and young adults as Cristiano shows that it is essential to fight for our dreams by being a hardworking and perseverant person. Thus, some celebrities can be great role models for today’s society as they teach people pertinent lessons.
To sum up, young individuals can be negatively influenced by celebrities who only flaunt their riches and lust.

576,"In the past, everyone wore clothes according to their culture but now people wear similar clothes all around the world. Is that a positive or negative development?","Fashion sense around the world is changing. In earlier times, people used to wear clothes as per their customs and beliefs, but these days, people all around the globe are following similar pattern while choosing clothes. In my opinion, it is a positive development.
Firstly, when people from different backgrounds prefer similar clothing it is advantageous for the whole industry. This arrangement makes clothing more affordable because big manufacturers can produce them in abundance. This automatically cuts down the cost.  For instance, Levis, a well-known brand in the garments industry makes jeans and shirts in bulk quantity and sells them at a reduced price. By contrast, if they do not do mass production, their cost will increase, making clothes more expensive.
Also clothes like jeans or trousers can be worn by people working in almost every sector whereas the ethnic wear of many countries can only be worn during certain formal occasions. For example, the Indian ethnic wear is not suitable for people working in factories or mines.
What’s more, wearing similar clothes protect a person from many different kinds of discrimination. For example, Japanese and Chinese people wearing shirt and trousers will look exactly the same. Likewise there will be nothing to distinguish between an Indian, a Pakistani and an Afghani is they wore similar clothes. Obviously, if people wore similar clothing, it gives them an appearance of uniformity and equality.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that the trend of wearing similar clothes is encouraging as it benefits both the individual and the economy.",8,now-people-wear-similar-clothes-all-around-the-world-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
577,Here is an essay on this topic submitted by one of our students. Send us your writing samples for a free band score estimate or get a detailed analysis of your writing for a fee.,"In many countries, the governments are razing down old structures to build new structures in their place. While some people believe that old buildings are an integral part of a city’s skyline, I agree with the argument that they should be demolished to make way for new world-class buildings.
There are ample reasons to state that old buildings should be removed from a city. Firstly, they are often dangerous and unsafe for their inhabitants and the surroundings. Due to their dilapidated conditions such structures are an eye-sore and require a lot of maintenance.
However, if they are razed down, the area can be further developed into world-class buildings which are more in-sync with current times. Secondly, the new buildings can be converted into multi-level offices, malls or even houses making the area more livable for its citizens.
Moreover, in today’s time when space has become a luxury in most countries, such positive changes can bring a sense of relief to the citizens. What’s more, the money spent on maintaining old structures can be better utilized for developing other kinds of infrastructure.
Of course, some people argue that old buildings represent a city’s rich past and razing them down will result in the end of an era. In their opinion, these buildings can be converted into museums or the like. However, in my opinion, it is not possible to convert all old buildings into museums or heritage sites. After all, most of our cities already have enough museums.
To encapsulate, I strongly assert that old buildings and structures should make way for new buildings with better infrastructure for the development of a city and a country.",8,some-people-think-that-the-government-should-knock-down-old-buildings-and-make-way-for-new-buildings-ielts-essay-sample
578,Some people say that cars are best to use in cities while others think that bicycles are better. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"People use diverse modes of transportation in urban areas. Many city dwellers believe that cars are the best way to get around the city. Others, however, argue that the bicycle is a better alternative. In my opinion, despite the fact that bicycles are more environment-friendly, cars are a superior option.
On the one hand, many people believe that bicycles are an effective solution to many environmental issues mankind faces. In other words, toxic fumes emitted by automobiles contain greenhouse gases which cause air pollution and global warming. By contrast, cycling does not produce any polluting or hazardous gases and hence it causes no harm to the already fragile environment. To illustrate, in New York City when the local council banned the use of cars and permitted only bicycles, there was a drastic drop in the pollution levels.
On the other hand, cars are generally more efficient and convenient than bicycles. They not only help the commuters to reach the workplace on time but also make the journey more comfortable. The yearly output of a large number of businesses will plummet if their employees can’t reach the workplace on time and this will ultimately affect the national economy. Also, bicycles can’t offer the comfort offered by cars. Especially, in the cases of an emergency when the life of a person hinges on timely treatment, a car can prove to be a savior. In such situations cars enable patients to receive / avail of) treatment on time without much discomfort and delay.
To sum up, even though bicycles help save / protect the environment, I believe that cars are a superior alternative because of their efficiency and the comfort they provide.",8,cars-are-better-than-bicycles-in-cities-ielts-essay-sample
579,Some people think that the government should take care of disadvantaged people such as unemployed and homeless people. Do you agree?,"Nations around the globe launch different schemes and programmes for the upliftment of less privileged sections of the society. Many people insist that the government must ensure the well-being of people who don’t have a job or home. While it is true that by helping the poor and the destitute the government can reduce the crime rate, I disagree with this approach to a great extent.
When the authorities take care of the basic needs of underprivileged people of a society, the number of crimes they commit plummets. Unemployment and homelessness frustrates individuals especially youngsters. As a consequence, they commit heinous criminal activities to give vent to their anger. However, if the authorities equip the unemployed with the skills which can easily earn them a job or provides homeless with a roof to stay, many of these issues can be easily tackled. For instance, in India various free training camps are regularly organised to teach vocational skills to the jobless young people. According to official data, this has dramatically reduced the number of crimes committed in different states.
On the other hand, providing financial assistance to the less-advantaged will take a toll on the economy of the country. It is a known fact that economies around the world need to allocate a considerable proportion of their budget to more serious issues like health, education and national security. If the large portion of the country’s budget is used for the rehabilitation of jobless and homeless, other more urgent problems will be left out. As a result, the nation’s development will come to a halt and all the citizens will eventually suffer. For example, in Nigeria, the government implemented the scheme for the rehabilitation of homeless people, but the scheme failed badly. The failure has been attributed to the negative effect this scheme had on Nigerian economy.
In conclusion, although governmental assistance for the welfare of the disadvantaged can certainly decrease the crime rate, I believe that any scheme or programme for their betterment will negatively impact the economic balance of the nation. A country should strike a balance between development and upliftment.",8,some-people-think-that-the-government-should-take-care-of-disadvantaged-people-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
580,"In many countries, very few young people read newspapers or follow the news on TV. What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?","Young people are no longer interested in reading newspapers or watching news programmes on television. There are many reasons behind this and the most important one is that youngsters are no longer dependent on television on print media for news and information. They can get updates on the go from the internet.
There are several reasons why newspapers are not being read by young people in many countries. The most important one is the evolution of information technology. One no longer has to read a newspaper to stay updated of the latest happenings in the world. It is now possible to get instant updates from websites like Google and Twitter. Another reason for this loss of interest in newspapers and news channels is the outdated way of presentation. Youngsters need byte sized information and lack the patience to read long news reports. Also, they have little interest in topics such as politics and business which receive undue coverage in traditional media.
However, youngsters should be encouraged to read newspapers because these are authentic sources of information. This is not exactly the case with social media where gossips spread faster than truths. In order to win the attention of young people, newspapers should find out what they are interested in. Likewise, news channels should create content that caters to their needs. It is proven that youngsters like to read about sports, stories and movies. To draw their attention towards the newspaper and news channels, these stories should be given more coverage. Moreover, to persuade them to read a newspaper, we should tell them about the benefits they can reap from reading newspapers.
To conclude, young people don’t read newspapers because they can receive news updates from other sources like the internet. Also they are not interested in the topics discussed in newspapers and on news channels.

581,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?","These days, people use computers to perform almost every activity. A lot of predictions are being made about the role of computers in future. People are also suspicious of benefits that come with computers and often wonder whether it is fine to depend on them.
I believe that depending on computers fine and there is no need to be scared of them. The way computers have evolved over the years, it is clear that their capabilities will increase even further in the coming years.
They will be used for space explorations. Humans have physical limitations when it comes to space travel or travelling to other planets. On the other hand, computer driven robots can perform remarkably well in such harsh conditions. Additionally, computers could be used to perform complicated surgeries. They will be able to operate on patients based on the intelligence they would have developed by that time.
Many people are not able to accept the changes that are brought by computers. These changes have made us dependent on computers.
But computers have proved themselves to be much more reliable than humans and therefore, dependence on them can be considered as a positive trend. Computers never make mistakes; they never rest and are significantly faster than humans. All these things make them highly dependable.
In conclusion, in the future the applications of computers will only increase. They may replace teachers in the classroom, doctors in the operation theatre and drivers behind the wheel. They are highly reliable because they do not make mistakes and do not rest. Therefore, depending on computers is a good trend.",8,is-dependence-on-computers-a-good-thing-or-should-we-be-more-suspicious-of-their-benefits
582,"Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future such as those related to science and technology.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","Relevance of the courses to be studied at university has long been a subject of debate. While some consider that the student’s personal choice is of utmost importance, others believe that subjects that are crucial for future growth and advancement must only be permitted.
In my opinion, despite the fact that choosing subjects of one’s choice has its merits/benefits, scientific and technical knowledge is extremely important for the growth and upliftment of a society. When a student has the freedom to choose their subjects, it will make learning more interesting for them. This will even improve their grades. Also, this freedom gives wings to a student’s imagination and creativity and provides opportunity to learn new and exciting details of the topics of interest. For instance, despite the fact that history courses have less practical value, a large number of students enrol in them because by doing so they can not only learn about past customs and traditions but also acquire in-depth knowledge of the origin and evolution of human civilizations. In other words, studying subjects of one’s choice might prove to be a positive and satisfying experience.
On the other hand, scientific subjects like biology, mathematics, physics and chemistry are certainly more valuable for the future progress of an individual and a nation. A student’s future job prospects dramatically increases after gaining science degrees and also he can serve the society better. Undoubtedly, scientific knowledge and skills can improve a country’s growth. This is especially evident in the industrial and agricultural sectors where scientific innovations increase the overall GDP of countries.
In conclusion, the freedom to study whatever subject a student wants certainly makes learning more interesting for them; however, in my opinion, subjects based on scientific and technical background will be more relevant in future and hence, should be given priority.",8,only-subjects-related-to-science-and-technology-should-be-taught-at-university-band-8-ielts-essay-sample

To what extent do you agree?","In the recent times, the advancement of technology such as the internet has definitely brought in numerous benefits. Along with these benefits, there are some threats as well. However in my opinion, these issues do not overshadow the advantages that technology has provided mankind.
The usage of technology has enabled man to lead a comfortable and easy life. In the ancient times where it took almost one or two months for a letter to reach its destination, now it only requires a fraction of seconds. The internet has also simplified many activities which were otherwise really cumbersome and tedious. For example, people can book tickets for travelling or movies, buy groceries, clothes or any useful items, transfer money to various bank accounts, pay bills of electricity, phones etc using the internet. Technology has also removed the barriers between different countries. An individual residing in the United can talk to or see another individual living in India.
Technology is indeed a blessing for human beings. However, it poses a threat to the confidentiality of the information. There have been many instances where highly confidential information was leaked, various bank account credential of individuals were hacked and they were robbed of their money. But these issues can be reduced or removed if proper safety measures are adopted.  Many cyber rules and regulations have already been formed to prevent such security breaches.    Also plenty of antivirus software is also available in the market to safeguard computer systems and data from any malicious attack.
In conclusion, technology advancement undoubtedly has helped mankind to progress and lead a comfortable life.

584,"In some developing countries, it is difficult to get good teachers to work in rural areas which can have negative impact on the education of children in those rural communities. Why do you think teachers do not want to work in rural areas in developing countries? What could be done to solve this problem?","In some developing countries, some teachers are reluctant to work in rural areas. This will affect the education of children in those villages negatively. In this essay I will explain why teachers are reluctant to work in rural areas and also suggest some solutions to tackle this issue.
Life may become more miserable if teachers opt to work in rural areas. The infrastructure of rural areas may not be as developed as the infrastructure of towns and cities. People may have to travel long distance to shop for items required for their daily life. In addition, rural areas are unlikely to have well-developed roads or transportation systems. Hospitals might be a few kilometers away and good doctors may not be available there as it is a rural area. The standard of life thus declines if teachers choose to stay and teach in rural areas.
However, if teachers are given more salary and incentives to work in rural areas, they may get motivated to teach in schools in villages. The government should offer more remuneration for rural teachers. In addition to this, more money needs to be invested for the infrastructure development of rural areas. The government should ensure that the facilities such as transportation systems, hospitals and other public and private services are functioning appropriately in rural areas. This way the government can ensure that people living and working in rural areas have access to quality services.
In conclusion, as the living standard of people in rural areas is not as good as that of people in towns and cities, teachers are reluctant to stay in rural areas to teach rural students. However, if the government offers more remuneration to teach in rural areas and if the facilities of rural areas are improved, more teachers may come forward to teach in schools in villages.",8,in-some-countries-teachers-do-not-want-to-work-in-rural-areas-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
585,Children today are too dependent on computers and electronic entertainment. It would be better for them to be outside playing sports and taking part in more traditional pastimes than spending all day indoors. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"These days, children spend most of their time watching television or playing games on mobiles and computers. However, it is recommended that they should participate in outdoor activities and go out to play different sports. I completely agree with this view and in this essay I will support my stand with valid examples and arguments.
Physical activities are quite essential for the mental and physical development of a child. Multiple medical studies have also proven that mobile games are making children lazy and affecting their overall development. Therefore, parents should encourage their children to play outdoor games like cricket, football, tennis, etc. For instance, according to a study conducted by a child welfare organization 60-70% of childhood health issues like back pain and obesity are caused by sitting in one place for a longer period of time while playing games on mobile and computers. By contrast, when children engage in outdoor activities, their physical strength and stamina increase. Games like hockey, cricket and football are team games and teach children team management skills and strategies for thinking.
Thus, it is evident that sports and other physical activities play a significant role in life. For example, a child participating in a game of football will learn to work under pressure and will improve his team skills.
In conclusion, with the advancement of technology, children get easy access to mobiles and computers and get addicted to them. However, for their overall development they should get involved in outdoor sports as it will help them to live a healthy life forever.",8,children-today-are-too-dependent-on-computers-and-electronic-entertainment-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
586,"Giving lectures in auditoriums to large numbers of students is an old way of teaching. With the technology available today there is no justification for it, and everything should be done online. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion.","Some people feel that in this age of online lectures and computer programs, the traditional way of giving lectures in large classrooms has become old-fashioned / ineffective. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, online lectures can be very convenient; however, traditional way of teaching is more effective and makes learning easier.
On the one hand, many people choose to take online lectures because they are very convenient. Many people study while working to upgrade their educational qualifications to get a promotion at work. These online lectures and online courses will allow working people to watch the lectures during their free time. For instance, these lectures can be watched during the weekend and they also allow people to pause in the middle of the lecture and and watch later. Because of this flexibility and convenience online lectures are very popular among many people.
Conversely, many students find the traditional way of teaching in classrooms more effective. Traditional lectures allow students to interact with lecturers when there is clarification required. To put it in another way, traditional lectures establish a connection between lecturers and students. For instance, a lecturer can tell at any point of time whether or not his students understand the lesson by simply looking at their faces and body language. Since online lectures are pre-recorded and delivered via the computer, this interaction between the teacher and the student is not possible.
To conclude, it is evident that online lectures give people the freedom to learn at a time convenient to them whereas traditional lectures provide the opportunity to interact with the teacher and clear doubts. In my opinion, online lectures cannot completely replace the class room lectures because they fail to create an important human connection between lecturers and students.",8,giving-lectures-in-auditoriums-to-large-numbers-of-students-is-an-old-way-of-teaching-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
587,It is sometimes thought that people who travel outside of their own country are more tolerant and understanding of others. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people argue that people who visit foreign countries are more open to differences and they are able to understand others in a better way. I strongly agree with this statement because of the reasons which will be discussed in this essay.
It is scientifically proven that the interaction with people of different cultures can affect one’s personality to a great extent. When people go to foreign countries, they have to face unfamiliar situations. Living in such unfamiliar situations makes people more adaptable to different circumstances. Thus they will become more tolerant of change/difference. This personality trait will help them to take more risks and accept changes in the future. As these kinds of people are more exposed to different lifestyles, customs and food habits, they understand others better.
By contrast, people who are not exposed to different cultures will be more narrow-minded than people who travel overseas frequently. It is difficult for them to adapt to unfamiliar situations compared to people who travelled and got exposed to different cultures. This is evident among uneducated people living in rural areas. They do not have much exposure to the outside world. They are very comfortable with their locality and they follow only traditional way of life. It is very difficult for them to embrace change. And also, it is difficult for them to understand and accept people who follow a different lifestyle.
In conclusion, people who are exposed to different cultures and practices are more open to different situations. They are tolerant and venture into new avenues with an open mind and they understand people better than people who do not travel much.",8,it-is-sometimes-thought-that-people-who-travel-outside-of-their-own-country-are-more-tolerant-and-understanding-of-others-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
588,"Some people fail in school, but end up being successful in life. Why do you think that is the case? What is most important thing to succeed in life?","These days academic qualification is considered to be the only means of achieving success. However, I do not agree with this view because there are several factors apart from school education which determine the success of a person.
Firstly, most educational institutes are still following the old-fashioned and out dated methods of teaching and as a result they stifle the creativity of the students. Also, many colleges do not assess the out of the box intelligence of a student. They only consider the grade. Consequently many students drop out. Thus it is evident that failing in school is not necessarily a sign of intellectual weakness. Rather it could be an indication of a student’s inability to benefit from conventional methods of learning. There are also many students who fail in school because the course curriculum is beyond their level of comprehension. Yet, many of them achieve success in life because they possess some other skills. For example, they may have a talent for singing or painting. Or maybe they are good at trading.
Success actually requires a variety of skills and personality traits. For example, in order to be successful in life, a person must possess the right attitude, determination and willingness to work hard. If they also have some academic credentials it will improve their chances of finding success. In other words, education can be one of the measures of an individual’s potential, but without hard work and perseverance, no one can achieve success in life.
In conclusion, just because someone failed in school, it does not mean that they cannot become successful in life. Success is actually a byproduct of hard work and perseverance.

589,With a growing world population one of the pressing issues is that of feeding such a large number of people. Some people think that GM foods offer a viable solution to this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"As the world population is rising, meeting the dietary needs of all people has become a matter of concern. Some people argue that growing more genetically modified food can tackle this issue. In my opinion, GM foods can solve this issue to a great extent but there are some other solutions as well for this problem.
Genetic engineering can be used for increasing the food production. By changing the DNA structure, people can make crops more disease and pest resistant. When crops are not destroyed by diseases and pest, the yield will be more. In addition to this, more desirable features can be added to crops by genetic engineering. For example, by using genetic modification we can grow bigger fruits or vegetables. Nutritional value of crops could also be increased by genetically modifying the crops.
However, GM crops have some drawbacks and depending more on them is not the right solution to this problem. When crops are manipulated to increase yield, certain natural nutritional contents may be lost and also, people may get allergies by consuming these kinds of foods. Because of these reasons it is unwise to depend too much on them. A better solution is to encourage all people to grow their food. If each family can grow enough food for themselves, food scarcity will not be a problem at all. If this is made a legal obligation, people can eat naturally grown healthy food and their nutritional requirements will be met.
In conclusion, GM foods can certainly solve the food scarcity to a great extent. However, they are not the only solution. Instead of depending on GM food bought from the market, people should try to grow their own food in their backyard.",8,some-people-think-that-gm-foods-can-solve-food-scarcity-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
590,"In recent years, more and more people are choosing to read e books rather than paper books. Do the advantages outweigh disadvantages?","In the modern world, people are increasingly reading books online and the demand of printed books has declined. In my opinion, the advantages of this trend outweigh its drawbacks.
There are many benefits to reading electronic books. The space required for storing electronic books is very small compared to the space required for storing printed books. Electronic books can be stored in small pen drives or in CDs and it is easy to carry them around. Actually hundreds of books can be stored in a small pen drive. By contrast, a large amount of space is required to store paper books. People usually need a room to keep their academic books. Another advantage is that people can buy ebooks online and download them to their device within seconds of completing the purchase. But if they buy paper books online, they have to wait for days or even weeks before their order is delivered. Better still, eBooks are eco-friendly. Since they do not require paper, no trees are cut down to produce eBooks. In addition, it is possible to get books published in different parts of the world. People can read books which are usually not available in their local stores.
The biggest disadvantage of eBooks is that they require us to stare at a screen for a long time and thus they may cause eye strain and other problems. More and more people have vision problems in the modern world because of the extensive use of computers. However, when compared to the convenience eBooks provide, this problem is negligible and also, vision protection screens for computers are available now.
In conclusion, it is not hard to see that eBooks are better than paper books in many aspects. They are portable and they don’t occupy physical space. They might cause eye strain but it can be easily prevented by using protective screens.",8,in-recent-years-more-and-more-people-are-choosing-to-read-e-books-rather-than-paper-books-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
591,"In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology.  However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The field of information technology witnessed remarkable advancements and innovations over the past two decades. However, some people argue that in the future, innovations in the field of IT will be largely negative. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, the IT field will offer more benefits than disadvantages in the future.
In the future, people will enjoy many benefits from the developments in the IT field. The field of artificial intelligence may flourish. Human beings may be able to explore space and the bottom of the sea to a great extent by sending robots to such areas. Robotic maids may be invented and they can help people to do their household activities and people can utilize that time for other productive activities. In addition to this, computers may identify the items which have run out and place an order through the internet. Furthermore, digital scent technology may allow people to smell the products available online before buying them.
The benefits of growth of information technology will be enormous but there will be a few downsides as well. In addition, people may lead a more sedentary life style in the future. When computers do all the day to day activities for human beings, people will become less active and this can cause several health issues such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases. It may also reduce the skills and abilities of human beings. When human beings do not use their intelligence, they may contract neurodegenerative diseases at a very young age.
However, if people make a conscious effort to ensure that they are not overly dependent on technology, these downsides will have little impact on them. For example, they can continue to memorize spellings and telephone numbers to ensure that their brain capacity is not affected.
To conclude, inventions and discoveries in the field of information technology will be more advantageous in the future. Of course, there will be a few downsides, but they pale in comparison to the advantages.",8,in-the-last-20-years-there-have-been-significant-developments-in-the-field-of-information-technology-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
592,Companies should encourage employees who work in a high position to leave at the age of 55 in order to give opportunities to the new generation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued that in order to provide opportunities for the young generation, senior employees should be encouraged to quit their job at the age of 55. I can agree with this argument only to a certain extent.
Senior employees who feel that they are done with their job and are financially strong enough to manage the rest of their life must be prompted to take retirement. This allows them to relax during their twilight years. Many companies already offer a voluntary retirement scheme for exhausted employees. Energetic and talented youngsters will eventually replace them and that looks like a promising solution.
However, a company may face some problems if senior employees leave. As senior employees are a treasure house of knowledge and experience, a company cannot allow all of them to leave early. There is no doubt in it that creative and innovative young minds can rejuvenate a company but without the guidance of senior employees, their efforts may not succeed. So to harness the insurmountable energy of young employees, a company seriously needs the mature and stable mind of seniors.
Let’s take the example of Bill gates. Although he has been working for many years, he still rules the computer industry because of the exposure and knowledge he has acquired over the years. Without his guidance, Microsoft cannot remain the number one software company.
In conclusion, after mulling over the whole issue, I believe that forcing seniors to retire when they are not ready for it is unjust on many grounds. I am quite sure that when I am 55 and above I will still be able to add value to my company. However, those who want to leave should be able to do so and still enjoy all the retirement benefits.",8,companies-should-encourage-employees-who-work-in-a-high-position-to-leave-at-the-age-of-55-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
593,All fathers should be entitled to time-off from work when their children are born. What is your opinion?,"Many companies now allow fathers to take a few days or weeks off from work after the birth of their child. In my opinion, this is a meaningful idea. In the following paragraphs I will explain why I think so.
Just like the mother, the father may also experience a lot of stress and tension in the days prior to and immediately after the birth of their child. The paternity leave makes it easy for them to cope with this situation. If the husband is working at office when his wife is in labour, he is going to experience a great deal of stress. As a result, his concentration on his work will reduce affecting quality. His inability to support his wife during the delivery of their baby is another cause of stress. Because of this reason, in many countries now fathers are also allowed days off from work after the birth of their baby. This short leave entitlement will not only enable the fathers to be with wives during the delivery but also provide work-life balance so that the quality of work is not compromised.
The second reason for allowing paternity leave is that husbands can help their wives to take care of the baby. Childbirth can be excruciatingly painful for the woman and she desperately needs someone to help her in the days immediately after the delivery. A husband can be of immense help to a woman if he is around her and her baby in the days immediately after delivery.
After closely analyzing the subject, it can be concluded that all fathers should be entitled to paternity leave. This will not only make childbirth less stressful for them but also enable them to offer crucial support to their wives during this important period of life.",8,all-fathers-should-be-entitled-to-time-off-from-work-when-their-children-are-born
594,"World history suggests that violence and conflict were more evident under male leadership than under female leadership. So, for peace to prevail female leadership can be considered as a better option than male leadership","Some people recommend that female leadership should be preferred to/over male leadership as there were fewer wars and less violence when women were in power. However, I disagree with the above statement because wars happen due to human greed and have nothing to do with the gender of the leader.
The major reason for my disagreement with the statement that female leadership will bring peace is that wars are not initiated by gender related aggression; rather they are a result of the greed of humans. It is human nature to want more and more and when that greed is not satisfied, conflicts happen.
History is replete with examples which prove that all wars were fought with the objective of seizing land, water, gold or riches. The fact that female leaders have shown no fewer acts of cruelty than male leaders is another reason for not supporting female leadership as a prerequisite for maintaining peace. For example, Rani Laxmi Bhai, a famous war heroine from India, showed no mercy to her enemies despite being a woman. The only reason why history had fewer wars under female leadership is because in older times most people hesitated to follow a woman; consequently, there were fewer wars when women were in power.
In conclusion, conflicts and battles happen due to human greed and not due to human gender; also if we study history it is not hard to see that female leaders behave in the same way as male leaders when it comes to warfare, and hence leadership shift from males to females will not make the world a more peaceful place.",8,world-history-suggests-that-violence-and-conflict-were-more-evident-under-male-leadership-than-under-female-leadership
595,"Due to the development and rapid expansion of supermarkets, many small local businesses are unable to compete. Some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","As a result of the growth of supermarkets in some countries, many local businesses have died out. Some people argue that without local business, local communities will not exist. In my opinion, even though the closure of regional enterprises may bring some difficulties to the local community, it will not endanger their existence.
Lack of traditional retail stores in a locality may pose some problems to the local population. People have to travel to the nearest shopping centre to get the items. It is a more expensive and time consuming activity compared to getting the items from local shops. In addition to this, in case of any emergency, when people do not have much time to waste to get the item, lack of local shops may put them in more trouble. For example, if some visitors turn up unexpectedly, the presence of small stores nearby will help people to treat them adequately.
Even though local population have to encounter certain difficulties due to the lack of small retail stores, it will not affect their existence. In the modern society, there are many supermarkets and shopping malls in all towns and cities. And also, people love to travel to these places and enjoy their shopping. In fact, in the current society, people prefer to buy items from supermarkets and shopping malls as these places offer many facilities such as cinema halls and restaurants for people to enjoy. Cheap transportation modes are also available to go to nearby shopping centres.
In conclusion, although the closure of regional shops may affect the local population negatively to a small extent, it will not threaten their existence.",8,due-to-the-development-and-rapid-expansion-of-supermarkets-many-small-local-businesses-are-unable-to-compete-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
596,Most people accept that we now live in a globalised world but not everyone agrees this is beneficial. To what extent is globalisation a positive or negative development? Give reasons for your answers and include relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.,"The world witnessed a lot of diverse developments in the 21st century. One such important development is globalisation and it has influenced every aspect of life. Many people are excited about living in a globalized world, yet a few people believe that globalization is not beneficial. A careful analysis shows that globalisation has both merits and demerits.
Globalisation offers us a plethora of merits. The most important one among them is the easy availability of services and products. It is because of globalisation, the services or products available only in selected countries are now available around the world. For example an Apple iPhone gets its motherboard and the phone body manufactured in USA and China respectively. This gets assembled in another country where it is sold. Globalisation has an additional advantage of increasing the employment opportunities in developing and under developed countries. Globalisation also helps to reduce the price of products by getting them manufactured in countries where the labour cost is low.
On the flip side, the negative aspects of globalisation cannot be wished away / cannot be overlooked. It interferes with the tradition, culture and the way of living of a country in which it is implemented. Globalisation enables multinational companies to exploit the natural resources of poor countries. To consider an example, beverage companies established in India have their presence in river beds. They consume gallons of water and affect the agricultural activity, which is the backbone of the country. Therefore globalisation alters the existing activity in a country to bring in a new service.
To recapitulate, even though globalisation has become essential for the ease of living, it also endangers the way of life in many countries.",8,most-people-accept-that-we-live-in-a-globalized-world-ielts-essay-sample
597,The best way to reduce traffic congestion in cities is to provide a free public transport service. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion with examples.,"Traffic congestion has become a global problem that jeopardizes human activities and affects the environment adversely. Some people argue that the best way to solve this issue is to provide free public transport. I believe that such a move will address the problem to a certain extent; however, it will not resolve it completely. In my opinion, a better solution is to build better and wider roads.
Firstly, providing public transport at no cost will encourage more number of people to use it. According to a survey conducted by “The Hindu”, nearly 46% of commuters readily agreed to utilize such a facility, owing to the fact that they can save a lot, in terms of money and fuel. Obviously, a free transport network will have a large number of users.
Nevertheless, there are some downsides to it. The foremost point of concern is that it will cost the government a great deal of money and thus burden the common man with heavy taxes. Taxes are not the only problem, though. Another point to consider is the peak hour traffic during which public transport is a very inconvenient option. Most offices provide free pick up and drop facilities for their employees to make their peak hour commute more comfortable. These people will certainly not want to use the public transport. What’s more, people living a life of luxury and comfort will want to travel by their own mode of transport at a time convenient to them. Thus it is evident that the idea of a no cost travel will not appeal to everyone.
In conclusion, providing free transport in cities will ease traffic congestion to a great extent. However, it is not a foolproof solution. if the government is looking for a lasting solution, it has to build better roads.",8,the-best-way-to-reduce-traffic-congestion-in-cities-is-to-provide-a-free-public-transport-service-band-8-ielts-essay-sample
598,"Employers sometimes ask people applying for jobs for personal information, such as their hobbies and interests, and whether they are married or single. Some people say that this information may be relevant and useful, others disagree. Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.","Many a time applicants are asked to provide personal information including their interests, hobbies and also marital status. Some recruiters feel that this information is useful. I agree with that view. In my opinion, personal information gives a lot of insight into a job applicant’s personality and hence it is crucial; however, there is a small risk of it being misused by the employer.
However, whether an employee needs to share personal information depends on the nature of the job. For example, a recruiter does not have to ask for the personal information of a contract employee or a consultant whose service is required for only a short period. Whereas in the case of a permanent job an employer must know about an applicant’s hobbies or interests as knowing about a person’s interests can help to understand if they possess leadership skills or if they are a team player. An employer may also benefit from knowing a potential employee’s marital status. For example, if an employer is looking to hire an air hostess who is supposed to work odd hours and even on weekends, it does not make sense for them to hire a woman with young kids.
On the down side, some people insist that employers should not ask for personal information. According to them, the recruiter may use the personal information to discriminate against an employee and this argument is valid to a certain extent. For example, an employer may decide not to hire an applicant whose religious or political ideologies clash with theirs.
To sum it up, I believe that the personal information is useful for the employer because in most cases it is a very important indicator of a person’s personality and his comfort level with a job. It is, therefore, understandable why employers ask for this. However, there is a small risk that the employer could use this information against an employee.",8,employers-sometimes-ask-people-applying-for-jobs-for-personal-information-such-as-their-hobbies-and-interests-band-8-ielts-essay-sample

Some people think that tourism is beneficial for local communities and should be encouraged. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this day and age, travelling around the world has become quite common because of better connectivity and cheaper flights. Some people believe that international tourism should be promoted because of its positive impacts. I totally agree with this view because tourism industry can be beneficial for a country and its people.
First and foremost, the tourism industry can create a variety of job opportunities for the natives. As international tourism benefits travel agencies, transportation services and accommodation providers, there will be a huge demand for local employees in the job market. In the long term, promoting tourism can be an effective way for the local government to solve the unemployment problem.
In addition to creating job opportunities, international tourism benefits the local economy in several other ways. Generally speaking, travelers from different countries are willing to spend money during their international trip. For example, it is common for Chinese tourists to spend a large amount of money on meals and luxury brands during their foreign trips. This can be a significant source of income for local stores, brands and restaurants. Moreover, there is no denying the fact that tourists love visiting heritage sites. By maintaining these sites properly, the government can showcase the rich culture and heritage of their country in front of an international audience. Better still, tourism is a green industry. It does not pollute the air or the soil.
To conclude, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that the local community and the government benefit immensely from promoting international tourism in their country.",8,over-the-last-few-decades-there-has-been-an-increase-in-international-tourism-band-8-ielts-essay-sample

Discuss both the views and give your opinion,"Some scientists argue that there is life on other planets and it is good to send messages to contact them while other scientists believe that these kinds of activities will be a threat to human existence on earth. In my opinion, trying to interact with life forms on other planets may have negative impacts on human life and it is better to avoid it.
Some scientists believe that contacting life forms on other planets is beneficial. If human beings can contact them, their resources can be utilized for the betterment of human life. For example, human population is increasing and natural resources are depleting. If we get alternative energy sources from them, it will be a great help for the human population on earth.
If the interaction with the life on other celestial bodies has a positive impact on human beings, it will be good but there is no guarantee for this. This kind of positive relationship is just an expectation. If extra terrestrial beings are superior to us, they are more likely to have destructive effect on us. Superior species always dominate inferior species just like human beings dominate other forms of life on earth. Many other living beings on earth are under threat of extinction as human beings are superior to them. Similarly, extra terrestrial beings may wipe out human beings from the earth. Moreover, great scientists such as Stephen Hawking have already given us warning against interaction with life forms on other planets. Human beings can live happily on this planet if they utilize natural resources wisely instead of exploiting them. There is no need to search for resources from other planet when there is no guarantee that they can help human species.
In conclusion, in my opinion, relationship with the life on other planets may have negative effects on the life on earth. It is better to use the resources on earth wisely and live here happily instead of trying to colonize other planets.",8,some-scientists-think-that-there-are-intelligent-life-forms-on-other-planets-and-messages-should-be-sent-to-contact-them-while-other-scientists-think-that-is-a-bad-idea-and-it-would-be-dangerous-ban
601,Many people believe that social networking sites such as Facebook have had a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extent do you agree?,"There is no denying the fact that social networking websites have become increasingly popular among people. It is argued that the negative consequences of various social networking websites are huge and affect our society in numerous ways. Although I agree with the argument / opinion that notable social networking sites lead the individuals in a wrong direction, I think that the benefits that they bring to our society are also commendable.
On the one hand, social websites are being used as a tool to polarise the people by spreading the fake news in order to win elections. Politicians and political parties are utilizing these sites as a medium to spread communal hatred for electoral gain. For instance, as per the recent investigation in the USA, the influence of Facebook in the last US election was significant. In addition, personal security has become a major concern as an individual’s data can be used for illegal activities.
On the other hand, as information sharing has become incredibly faster than ever before, the social network sites aid / help to handle critical situations effectively. Any individual can get emergency help just by posting a message on any of the popular social network sites. For example, when there is an urgent need for rare group blood, people often post a message on Facebook and they receive help immediately. Moreover, these websites play an absolutely imperative role in connecting people all over the world. People share their emotions and feelings with others, which eventually reduce their stress and anxiety during crises.
In conclusion, while I tend to agree with the argument that the social network sites are being misused by many and that affect both the individual and the community severely, I think that these sites play an important role in helping people manage critical situations.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-3
602,News stories on TV and in newspapers are very often accompanied by pictures. Some people say that these pictures are more effective than words. What is your opinion about this?,"Photographs have become an integral part of news stories. Some people believe that the pictorial presentation of news is more effective than textual pesentation. I completely agree with the statement and in this essay, I will support my view with valid arguments and examples.
There is no doubt that pictures attract the attention of the audience. They also give a basic understanding of the news story and thus make it easy for the reader to figure out which stories are worth their attention. In this age of information explosion, we are bombarded with news stories. We receive updates every second and it is impossible to read or watch all of the stories that we come across. Pictures make it easy to filter out stories we are not interested in.
What’s more, according to a survey conducted by the media association, 70% of readers are more likely to read a news story accompanied by an image. To illustrate, I am a great fan of Amitabh Bachchan. Whenever I see him on screen or in a newspaper, I become more curious to read or watch the whole news story. It is his photo that grabs my attention. Furthermore, by adding more pictures to news articles, news editors can attract the attention of children as well. For example, there is a particular section in Sunday’s newspaper which highlights children specific topics and contains more graphics than text material. That colorful page attracts my son the most and, as a result, he goes through that entire section without fail. Thus it is evident that if there is no picture the media may lose the attention of a particular group of audience.
To sum up, I believe that including pictures in news can play a pivotal role in gaining / attracting reader’s attention to a particular topic. Pictures can also tell a story more vividly and make comprehension easier.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-news-stories-on-tv-and-in-newspapers-are-very-often-accompanied-by-pictures
603,"Today more and more tourists are visiting places where conditions are difficult, such as the Sahara desert or the Antarctic? What are the benefits and disadvantages of this?","Tourism has acquired diverse dimensions over the years. Today, a large number of people are heading to places where conditions are pretty hostile. There are both advantages and disadvantages to this trend and I will discuss both of them in this essay.
On the one hand, there are many advantages to visiting remote areas.Firstly, tourism strengthens the economic conditions of such places. With more tourists arriving in a country the economy of that country grows manifolds. Secondly, tourism industry is the main provider o) employment in such areas where people cannot find any other means to earn a livelihood. Thirdly, to support tourism many roads and hotels are built in remote areas. These facilities are also used by locals and hence, they too are benefited.
On the other hand, this kind of tourism has its disadvantages too. Firstly, local people find it difficult / challenging to share the already scarce natural resources with tourists. For instance, water is already scarce in the desert areas and with more tourists coming in the life becomes really hard for locals. Secondly, many places in the Antarctic and Himalayas are already under threat due to the influx of tourists.
To conclude, in my opinion, the positive aspects of visiting dangerous places like Sahara and Antarctica outweigh the negative aspects. What’s more, tourists can take certain measures to ensure that you are not causing much damage to these ecologically sensitive areas. For example, they can ensure that they do not litter around.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-today-more-and-more-tourists-are-visiting-places-where-conditions-are-difficult
604,"Some people say that in all levels of education, from primary schools to universities, too much time is spent on learning facts and not enough on learning practical skill. Do you agree or disagree?","There is no doubt that practical exposure is as important as theoretical knowledge. A number of people think that much time is devoted to teaching the facts instead of focusing on hands-on experience in all phases of learning, whether it is school or college. I completely agree with the statement and in this essay I will support my view with valid arguments and examples.
Most of the institutes follow conventional method of teaching which includes reading, learning and writing. By this method, children can only recall concepts for a limited amount of time and when it is time to apply that knowledge at work they have forgotten it. Consequently, many students who have degrees in physics or electronics cannot even change bulbs. Likewise, many MBAs cannot fill out a tax form. All of these point to the shortcomings of a system of learning that focuses only on theory.
Another example of this is that the current curriculum does not have an equal number of theory and practical classes. To illustrate, while I had one lecture each day on the theoretical aspects of computers), there was only 1 laboratory session in the whole week. Due to this improper division, I could not practice everything being taught and hence lacked proper understanding of the concepts. If we had equal proportion of theory and practical classes, I would have gained better skills and confidence. A recent study by the educational department of New Delhi has shown that youngsters who were shown experiments were able to memorize and retain the information for a longer period of time then the ones who read it.
To conclude, I agree with the argument that much time is being spent on cramming instead of experimental learning because of the current structure of teaching. Unfortunately, this overemphasis on theory prevents / stops students from acquiring real world skills.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-say-that-in-all-levels-of-education-from-primary-schools-to-universities-too-much-time-is-spent-on-learning-facts-and-not-enough-on-learning-practical-skill
605,"Today, more and more students are deciding to move to a different country for higher studies. Do you think that benefit of this outweighs the problem?","The number of students going abroad for higher education has increased tremendously in the contemporary world. In my opinion, leaving one’s own country for higher education eventually brings more problems than advantages.
Admittedly, there are some basic benefits to studying in a foreign country. Firstly, the student gets a chance to find employment in overseas markets after the completion of their course. Since salaries are higher in these countries, their financial situation will definitely improve when they work abroad. Secondly, overseas programs provide them with an opportunity to study with students of other nations. This in turn, not only develops their communication skills but also encourages them to think in a different manner, as they socialize with students of an entirely different society.
Nevertheless, despite the advantages mentioned above, I believe that there are some serious disadvantages to studying abroad. One of the major problems is that students who study abroad do not contribute to their own country economy. To illustrate, migration of skilled people to other countries has slowed down the development of countries like India. Students who should) have been entrepreneurs in their own country, are seen running successful businesses and paying taxes in other countries. Another potential problem of studying abroad is that students have to pay higher fee for their studies. They often have to work part time to fund their studies and this takes their focus away from their studies. Another issue is that living away from families in a highly competitive environment leads to a stressful life. This could be one of the main reasons that provoke students to commit serious crimes.
To conclude, people may have different opinions but I believe that the major drawbacks of going abroad for higher studies far outweigh the minor advantages. This trend affects the economic growth of their own country and also makes life stressful for them.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-today-more-and-more-students-are-deciding-to-move-to-a-different-country-for-higher-studies
606,More developing countries are being given aid by international organizations to help them in their development plans. Some people argue that financial aid is important but others suggest that practical aid and advice are more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays many world wide organizations are providing financial assistance to developing countries. However, a group of people advocate that financial support is required but some technical help would be more useful. This essay will discuss both the view points before arriving at a conclusion.
There are several reasons why monetary help is beneficial for developing nations. Firstly, many emergent countries are struggling with the problems related to basic infrastructure like roads, railways and public transportation. Therefore, they need financial support from external bodies to complete unfinished projects and also to launch new ones. Secondly, a number of developing and undeveloped countries are not able to provide basic facilities to their citizens. For example, millions of people living in poor countries still do not have access to food, water or sanitation.
In order to provide these basic requirements, the government needs funds from international companies. For instance, according to a report submitted by WHO, 88 percent of developing nations are taking advantage of financial support provided by the World Bank. As a result, billions of people from across the world are able to get access to basic facilities.
However, financial aid alone will not help. Developing nations also need technical support and practical advice. It has been observed that the money sanctioned by world agencies for development is not always utilized for the right purpose. Instead, it is used by corrupt politicians to serve their interests. Therefore, many developing nations are facing issues like corruption, scams etc. It would be quite helpful if they can also get some practical support and advice to boost their economy.
In conclusion, international organizations should help developing countries to grow by providing financial support. However, in my opinion, it is equally important to provide some practice advice as it will help them overcome their problems.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-more-developing-countries-are-being-given-aid-by-international-organizations-to-help-them-in-their-development-plans
607,"Some people believe that in present times, women do get as much equality at work as men, while others believe that even today women have to fight their way to succeed at work. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Women now certainly enjoy more rights and privileges than they did in the past. This can be seen in the increasing number of women in the workplace. Some argue that in this day and age, women enjoy as much equality as men while others counter this and claim that even today women have to struggle for their success at work. Both sides of this argument will be analysed in this essay before a reasoned conclusion is drawn.
On the one hand, an ever rising number of women are employed in higher management positions in roles that were traditionally considered to be suitable for men only. For example, the current national assembly of New Zealand consists of 54 women and 58 men. This is the highest proportion of women in the national assembly in the history of New Zealand. Women also serve in armed forces in many countries and in sectors like healthcare and teaching, there are more women than men. Therefore, it is obvious why the argument that women get the same equality as men has garnered support.
On the other hand, the situation is different in the corporate world where women still have to overcome many obstacles and challenges to get to the top positions in the corporate world. Take a recent survey conducted by Robert Walters for example. This survey highlighted that an alarming number of employers were hesitant to hire women as head of the departments due to the possibility of women having to take maternity leave. This is reflected in the disproportionately higher number of men occupying higher management positions in Fortune 500 companies than women. When seen in this light, it is obvious that women still have to fight a lot more than men for success at work.
In conclusion, both sides of the argument are valid; however, I personally feel that women still have to deal with a myriad of obstacles to succeed at their workplaces. This is particularly true in the corporate world. It is hoped that one day this gender gap will cease to exist.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-believe-that-in-present-times-women-do-get-as-much-equality-at-work-as-men
608,"Computers are being used more and more in education. Some people say that this is a positive trend, while others argue that it is leading to negative consequences. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The use of computers as an educational tool is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Some believe that the use of computers in education is a positive trend while others disagree. Both sides of this argument will be analysed in the essay before a reasoned conclusion is drawn.
On the one hand, with the advancements in artificial intelligence computers are able to teach and even assess language skills of individuals. For example, the Pearson Test of English uses highly sophisticated technology to judge the speaking and writing prowess of test takers. This has not only reduced the cost of administering the test but also eliminated the human factor from the evaluation process. Therefore, it is understandable why many people view increasing use of computer in education as a positive trend.
On the other hand, the ever increasing use of computer in education can lead to lesser human interactions between teachers and students. For instance, many colleges now offer pre-recorded video lectures instead of live lectures. Since such an arrangement cannot accommodate back and forth questions and answers between teachers and pupils, numerous learning difficulties can arise as a result. Obviously, there are some disadvantages / drawbacks to the increasing use of computers in education. However, these disadvantages pale in comparison to the advantages of using computers in education.
Although there are valid arguments on both sides, I personally believe that the rising use of computers and artificial intelligence in education is a positive phenomenon. It is safe to assume that in the future computers will play an even bigger role in education.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-2
609,The growing number of overweight people is putting a strain on the health care system. Some people think that the best way to deal with this problem is to introduce more physical education lessons in school curriculum. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that more physical education lessons in the school curriculum will help combat overweight problems amongst the people. In my opinion, this approach / move will help create a nation of health conscious people. This, in turn, will reduce the burden on the government to contribute to the health sector. Instead, it can use those resources in areas like education and employment.
First and foremost, children are more likely to follow what is taught in the classroom.  So, if there are more physical education lessons, they will readily learn about ways to keep them fit and healthy. By giving extra importance to physical education, teachers can instill in children the habit of following a healthy lifestyle from the start. In addition, nowadays in many families both the husband and the wife work and hence they do not have time to monitor the eating habits of their children. In such situations, if the child is well-informed he can help himself to decide when to eat what.
Also, a habit that is developed during younger stages in life is more likely to stay with them throughout their life. A well informed person will not only follow a healthy routine himself but will also motivate the people around him. Finally, overweight problems, if not controlled, lead to obesity and combating obesity is a tough task. It not only requires individual efforts but also medications. This increases the burden on the government to invest in a situation which could have stopped earlier.  Worse still, it blocks funds which could have been used in more critical areas like poverty.

Do the advantages outweigh disadvantages?","Lately, there has been an increase in the number of people who prefer to read e-books instead of paper books. In my opinion, this trend has more advantages than disadvantages.
Despite some problems stated below, e-books bring a lot of benefits for both readers and the environment. Firstly, one of the evident benefits associated with e-books is that they make the purchasing process easier and quicker for readers. Instead of going to book stores to purchase books, readers can easily purchase the e-books over the internet whenever required. Secondly, e-books assure ease of accessibility to readers. In other words, reading devices such as Kindle can be loaded with hundreds of books at the same time and the readers can access the same whenever required. Finally, e-books are an eco-friendly alternative to paper books. This is extremely beneficial for the environment as trees are not required to be cut to produce papers.
Admittedly, there are also some minor problems associated with e-books. One of the common concerns is that continuous reading of ebooks may strain the eyes of the reader. Also they expose the reader to radiation and cause health problems in them. This can be easily avoided by taking short intervals while reading. Another possible issue related to e-books is that they can be lost if the reading device storing them gets corrupted. For example, a reading device can get corrupted due to virus. Again, readers can overcome this by installing anti-virus software on reading devices.
In conclusion, the benefits which e-books offer such as convenience and eco-friendliness clearly outweigh any disadvantages associated with them.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-in-recent-years-more-and-more-people-are-choosing-to-read-e-books-rather-than-paper-books-do-the-advantages-outweigh-disadvantages
611,"Cycling has many benefits, yet in some countries there is a decrease in the number of people using bicycles as their main form of transportation. Why is this happening? Give suggestions on how to encourage people to use bicycles again.","Cycling is no longer a popular mode of transportation. This is sad especially when we consider the fact that cycling is healthier than driving/ cycling offers many health benefits.
This essay will discuss the possible reasons behind the decline in the use of bicycles and also suggest some ways to make them popular again. One of the main reasons for the declining popularity of cycling is the change in our lifecycle.
With the advancement in modern technology, people have become lazy and dependent on motor vehicles. Little do they realize the value of physical exertion associated with cycling. To add to this, we do not have separate lanes for cyclists and consequently their safety is at risk. Also thanks to the addition of new features and comfort mechanism, modern bicycles are quite expensive. The price hike makes people reluctant to buy bicycles.
There are various ways to encourage people to use bicycles. Firstly, the law enforcement agencies should focus on constructing separate lanes for cyclists. To reduce the number of automobiles on the roads, the government should impose a carbon tax on them. Secondly, the government should launch campaigns to create awareness about the health benefits of cycling. For instance, the government can promote the practice of cycling to work.
In conclusion, I believe that cycling is no longer considered an exciting activity and its use has decreased steeply; but we can make it popular again by creating awareness about its health benefits. The government should also build separate lanes for cyclists.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-cycling-has-many-benefits-yet-in-some-countries-there-is-a-decrease-in-the-number-of-people-using-bicycles-as-their-main-form-of-transportation
612,Some people think that the government is wasting money on the arts and this money could be better spent elsewhere.,"Art has regained some of its lost glory and governments have started realizing the importance of preserving it. While some people welcome this trend, I completely disagree with this practice as I believe there are several other critical functions for the public administration to focus on.
It is widely accepted that the field of arts not only represents the contemporary lifestyle but also helps us to reflect back on the lives of our ancestors. Historical artifacts like sculptures and paintings that are exhibited in various museums attract a lot of visitors and generate some revenue as well. For example, the Kohinoor diamond of Delhi sultanate is a very famous exhibit in the British Royal Museum in U.K. But I believe that the cost of maintaining the museums and the salaries of curators easily exceed this income .Therefore, no official can justify this investment in art as it is not of any benefit to the general public.
What’s more, other critical functions of the society like public healthcare continue to be ignored by a lot of countries. Large sections of the community especially the underprivileged are deprived of basic health amenities like vaccines and preventive health checkups. For Instance, the disease of tuberculosis continues to affect thousands of Indians even today. If the government had diverted some of the funds invested in art to these areas, India would have had a stronger young generation. Therefore, I believe that public representatives should start thinking about these vital aspects instead of spending money on the maintenance of art galleries and reviving lost art forms.
To conclude, despite the fact that art contributes a lot to the society and tourism in general, I would like to emphasise the fact that governments should invest most of the funds in crucial services like the public healthcare which help in building stronger nations.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-think-that-the-government-is-wasting-money-on-the-arts-and-this-money-could-be-better-spent-elsewhere
613,"Education should be accessible to people of all economic backgrounds. All levels of education, from primary school to tertiary school should be free. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people argue that education should be accessible to everyone free of cost regardless of their financial status / background. I totally agree with this argument.
Nowadays, educational qualifications are the primary requirements for any high paid jobs since most companies like to hire individuals with college degrees. Firstly, making education available to all at no cost means that every individual in the society has an equal opportunity to get a professional job. Many people often complain that they could not get receive university education because it was expensive.
For instance, Times reported that Norwegians have more patents to their names than people of any other country ever since Norway made education free for all in 1980. Education is important in everyone’s life because it is essential to meet basic needs such as food and shelter.
If a person failed to graduate then this individual would find it harder to find a satisfying job. This might force him to look for alternative options to make easy money rather than work hard and he could end up in jail.
Moreover, if a society is educated then it will prosper and bring more happiness and joy to the country. Consequently, the country’s productivity and efficiency will increase because of its highly educated workforce. For example, a Harvard study concluded that the productivity of countries like China and India increased by over 200 percent during the last 20 years because of an increase in literary rate arising from free education.
In conclusion, education is a basic need of all people, so it should be free from kindergarten to college level.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-education-should-be-accessible-to-people-of-all-economic-backgrounds
614,Scientific Research should be carried out and controlled by the government rather than private companies. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Scientific research plays a very important role in the progress of a nation. It is argued that research should be controlled and funded by the government, and not private organisations or institutions. This essay agrees with the argument that the government should carry out various research works in different fields and will outline the reasons why government should be responsible for research projects.
There are several reasons to support my view point. Firstly, the government is capable of providing financial assistance to various research projects. Moreover, if the project fails to achieve its objectives, the government has the resources to cope up with the losses incurred. Secondly, the main motive of the government in conducting research is public welfare. Thirdly, when government funds research activities, there is utmost security. They do not disclose any information which could hamper national security. That is why research and development in the field of military is carried out by the government.
When private organisations conduct research, their chief concern is protecting their interests. This explains why the research conducted by coffee companies or gum companies only highlights the benefits of their products. This is not the case when the government funds research. In this case, the final verdict is more likely to be unbiased.
To conclude, after analysing the various aspects of the argument, it is not hard to see that the government funding of research is in the interests of the public. Private organizations, on the other hand, may have their own vexed interests to protect.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-scientific-research-should-be-carried-out-and-controlled-by-the-government-rather-than-private-companies
615,Some people blame the government for the increase in childhood obesity while others think it is the parents’ fault. Discuss both sides and give your opinion,"Obesity is one of the major concerns we face today. Some individuals believe that the government is responsible for the increased incidents of obesity among children.  Whilst, others argue that parents are accountable. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and provide my opinion.
It is true that the government could have taken preventive measures to control obesity in children. The government could pass regulations that require food companies to produce chocolates, cheese and chips with more nutrients. These regulations will force companies to sell their food products at higher prices. This, in turn, will reduce their consumption and when consumption of junk foods decreases, incidents of obesity will also decrease. For example, New York Times reported that children of New York are less obese than children of other states in the US because the local government there regulated the food industry a long time ago. However, government intervention alone will not prevent obesity in children. Parents have an equally important role to play. They should monitor their children’s eating habits to control obesity.
Nowadays, many parents work long hours to feed their children, but they do not realize that the food that they serve is not of high quality. This is another reason for the increase in childhood obesity. So parents must find the time to cook proper meals for their children. If both of them are busy, they can share this responsibility between themselves. This way obesity can be controlled or eliminated.
In conclusion, both the government and the parents can play an important role in controlling childhood obesity. The government should regulate the food industry and parents should serve healthy home cooked meals.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-blame-the-government-for-the-increase-in-childhood-obesity-while-others-think-it-is-the-parents-fault
616,Some people consider thinking about and planning for the future to be a waste of time. They argue that people should simply live in the moment.  Do you agree or disagree?  Use at least one personal example in your response.,"Planning for the future has been the most crucial aspect of human life. Some people argue that instead of worrying about the future, we should live in the present. This approach certainly has its own benefits, but I believe that making strategies for the future is more advantageous for a person who wants to succeed in his life.
Undoubtedly, planning for the future keeps a person motivated and ambitious throughout his lifetime. In other words, an individual with clear career goals and objectives will work hard towards achieving them. For instance, my friend succeeded in IAS exam recently because started preparing for it while he was in high school itself. Hence, it goes without saying that people who plan ahead are the ones who really taste the fruit of success.
Moreover, creating a master plan for the times ahead encourages a person to save money for investment in future projects such as their business goals or their children’s education. Also the money thus saved will help them tide over any financial crises that they may face in the future. For example, I have been saving money for the last few years and this habit enabled me to pay for my child’s treatment for an autoimmune disorder.
However, some people assert that planning for the future is quite stressful and therefore living in the present keeps them happy and contented. Also, in their opinion, no one can change their destiny and if they are destined to lose something, they will lose it no matter what. But, in my opinion, this is not a wise strategy. Even if this is true to a certain extent, a little bit of planning will certainly help us to cope better in difficult times.
In conclusion, even though future planning may be a little stressful, I believe that it in the long term it is the key to success.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-consider-planning-for-the-future-to-be-a-waste-of-time
617,More and more people nowadays are buying fashionable clothes. Does it have a more negative or positive effects? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.,"There is no denying the fact that the sales of the fashionable clothes have risen dramatically in the last few years. The positive side of this trend is eclipsed by its negative aspects. This essay will analyse both the aspects in the following paragraphs.
It is argued that wearing branded clothes enhances the self confidence of an individual. This notion was championed by a survey done by a leading magazine. According to it, people who wore fashionable clothes on the day of the interview did better than those who wore regular attire. Furthermore, it is believed that wearing trendy attire enhances the personality of the individual. This, in turn, improves his self esteem and he may even win the respect/admiration of his colleagues / friends.
However, this positive side of having branded apparel is overshadowed by its negative aspects. First and foremost, clothes endorsed by celebrities are usually very expensive. Consequently, the obsession with wearing branded costumes may hurt the financial health of a middle class family. Secondly, fashion trends are ephemeral, lasting at the most one season. This casts doubt on the long term utility of these clothes. Hence, wastage of dresses is a huge concern. Last but not least, there are serious aspersions on the quality of clothing material as they are meant for short term usage. Therefore, it is evident that negative aspects of buying fashionable clothes dominate its few positive effects.
To conclude, it is clear that fashionable clothes are more of a luxury than a necessity. Performance in any walk of life should not depend upon the type of clothes one wears; rather it should depend on one’s intellect and education. Therefore, it is reasonable to state that negative aspects of following fashion trends outweigh its positive side.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-more-and-more-people-are-buying-fashionable-clothes
618,"Many criminals re-offend after they have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?","It is true that a large number of criminals do not change and keep on committing crimes even after punishment. There are several reasons for repeating crimes after serving a term and various steps can be taken to prevent such behaviour at societal as well as government level.
There are a few reasons to explain the behaviour of criminals after they come out serving time in prison. Firstly, although they might be reformed individuals, some societies still see them as guilty and do not accept them as members of their community. The rejection and social alienation tempt ex-prisoners to take revenge and commit crimes again. Secondly, their past criminal records make it difficult for ex-prisoners to find employment. Consequently, they get into crime to get over their poverty. Finally, some are professional criminals. They want to earn money quickly so they commit crimes like burglary, extortion, robbery and blackmailing. They are so used to making money easily that they cannot stop it even after getting punished.
There are several actions that can be taken to curb the problems. The government should enforce strong vocational training so that they do have options available when they are released. Apart from that, all prisoners should be counselled by psychologists who can evaluate their behaviour and mental status. This way, potential re-offenders can be identified easily and special attention be given to them.
In addition to that, it is the responsibility of the police department to train and educate the public about the behavioural and circumstantial aspects of any crime. By doing so, they can create acceptance for reformed criminals and give them an opportunity to lead a normal life after serving punishment.
In conclusion, most of the times, there are specific reasons for ex-criminals to commit crimes again.

619,People spend a lot of money on tickets of sporting and cultural events. Is this a good or bad development?,"There is a trend among people to spend a lot of money for buying tickets of sporting events and cultural shows. Some people think that this is a positive development and it should be encouraged. Others disagree with that view. Both opinions will be discussed in this essay.
Some people believe that for them to attend either a cultural or sporting event, a lot of money would have to be spent not only on tickets but also on other trip necessities such as transportation, accommodation and food especially if the event is being held away from their locality or place of residence. These people are of the opinion that that money could instead have been spent on some other things that are worthier. For instance, it could be invested in gold or property.
While these arguments may sound logical, I believe that these people are ignorant or less informed of the bounty of benefits that comes with attending or participating in such events. When people attend cultural or sporting events especially those held away from their locality or place of residence, they are absolutely exposed to the lifestyle and culture of the host communities, and this in most cases results in learning the ways of life of those people. In addition, attending sporting events is a great way to take some time off work and relax.
Sporting and cultural events attract people from different walks of life, religious and cultural backgrounds, and they are an opportunity to make new friends and build relationships. As a matter of fact, I am personally making arrangements for my family and me to attend the upcoming soccer world cup sporting event which will be held in Russia during this summer. It has been proven over the years to be one of the most fascinating sporting events around the globe. I believe that money spent on such an event is worth it.
In conclusion, contrary to what a lot of people think spending a lot of money on sporting events is not a waste. In my opinion, it is a good development and people should realize the enormous benefits of embarking on such trips.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-people-spend-a-lot-of-money-on-tickets-of-sports-and-cultural-events
620,Some people claim that there are more disadvantages to the car than advantages. Do you agree or disagree? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of having a car. Give reasons for your answer.,"There has been a tremendous increase in the number of cars over the last few decades and this development has significantly affected the lifestyle of people. The biggest advantage of having a car is that people can go wherever they want whenever they are ready. However, some argue that the huge number of cars has critically impacted the human beings in a negative way. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, cars have an equal number of merits and demerits.
People who are objected to having a car assert that the cars can deteriorate air quality. Too many cars also cause traffic congestion in cities. Most cars are driven by fossil fuels which emit harmful gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Even though scientists are trying to develop eco-friendly fuels, those technologies are still in the nascent stage and they may take many more decades to be available. Nowadays in Seoul, Korea, the quality of air is so bad that wearing a mask is mandatory to maintain one’s health.
On the flip side, cars also offer various benefits. They have made commuting easier. Cars are particularly helpful in emergencies where getting to the destination in the least possible time is of utmost importance. In addition, the car industry generates many jobs and boosts the national economy.
To sum up, there are merits and demerits to owning a car. In my opinion, cars have become an indispensable part of our lives. However, we should bear in mind that overuse of cars will harm our environment.
But we should bear in mind that our nature will be destroyed if we overuse the car. We should control the usage of the car for protecting our environment for the next generation.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-there-are-more-disadvantages-than-advantages-to-cars
621,Housing and accommodation has become a major problem in several countries. What are the major factors that contribute to the problem? What can be done to help reduce the number of homeless people?,"The scarcity of houses is becoming a serious issue in many countries. The changing family structure and the explosion of population seem to be at the root of this problem. However, some workable solutions which can ameliorate the situation exist.
The biggest factor which causes the shortage of houses is the burgeoning population. The accelerating birth rate and the limited availability of land have made it difficult / challenging to provide housing for all the people. Another factor which aggravates the problem of housing is the increasing trend of nuclear families. While children used to live with their parents as well as grandparents in the past, today’s children prefer to live alone either to maintain their privacy or to fulfill work and study related commitments. This means more houses are required to accommodate more families.
On the bright side, there are solutions to this problem. The government should enact new laws that help in effective utilisation of available land for housing. For example, the government should make legislations to force citizens to make use of underground space. For instance, garage or storeroom which does not need much lightening can be built in the basement. The land saved thus can be provided to other homeless people. Likewise, people should be encouraged to reside in high rise buildings of closely knitted apartments since these can house more people in a relatively smaller piece of land.
In conclusion, housing problems are caused by the growing population and the increase in the number of nuclear families. However, the government can mitigate this problem by encouraging the use of underground spaces and the construction of skyscrapers.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-housing-has-become-a-main-problem-in-many-countries
622,Some employers find that their new employees lack in basic interpersonal skills such as lack of ability to work with colleagues as a team. What are the causes of this problem? Suggest solutions.,"Nowadays many employees lack interpersonal qualities such as communication skills or team spirit. This could be due to the inadequacies of our education system and the method of interview used to select employees. Both problems need to be addressed to find a solution.
The most predominant factor which leads to lack of interpersonal skills in potential employees is our education system itself. To elaborate, academic success of students is measured in terms of their ability to grasp voluminous syllabus with little focus / emphasis on extracurricular activities. Employers also give preference to candidates with good academic grades. Consequently, students focus on improving their scores in exams rather than participating in sports and other events, which may enhance their interpersonal skills.
To tackle this problem, it is important to change the grading criteria of students and the selection method of employees. If students are given extra marks for participating in a college function or stage programme, they will make these activities a part of their study life. And when they work with their college mates they will acquire useful skills such as teamwork, interpersonal communication or leadership.
Furthermore, instead of focusing solely on their academic grades, interviewers should test candidates from various aspects to judge their true potential. For instance, group discussion before an interview can be used to analyse how participants accept others’ opinion or how they react to differing views.
In conclusion, our faulty grading system and the focus on academic success are the reasons for the lack of interpersonal skills among employees. The only solution to this problem is to make extracurricular activities an integral part of the learning process.

623,Most people believe that stricter punishment should be given for traffic offences. To what extent do you agree?,"The increase in the number of accidents on roads has become a matter of concern for people at large. Many people opine that strict punishments should be given for traffic violations. I agree with this opinion to a certain extent. In my opinion, some other measures should also be taken along with stricter punishments to solve this problem / to make our roads safer.
Our law has already defined some penalties for minor mistakes and suspension or cancellation of licence for major offences. Imprisonment is also given for serious and fatal accidents. For example, in 2004, the Indian government enacted laws that impose rigid penalties on people who drink and drive. This actually led to the reduction of drunken driving cases.
Though / although the strict laws seem to deter a lot of offenders, many people still violate traffic rules. Obviously, some other initiatives need to be taken along with these strict laws. Firstly, the government should start some awareness campaigns to make people aware of the devastating consequences of the traffic offences.
Secondly, more surveillance cameras should be installed on the roads because the fear of everything being recorded might force some people to follow rules. Last but not least, driving licenses should be given to people only after complete scrutiny of their driving skills. This is not exactly the case in many countries where aspirants can bribe officials and get the licence issued to them.
To sum up, in my opinion, strict punishments alone are not sufficient. Some other measures too should be taken to reduce accidents.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-many-people-believe-that-stricter-punishment-should-be-given-for-traffic-offences
624,"In education and employment, some people work hard than others. Why do some people work hard? Is it always a good thing to work hard?","It is true that some people work hard while others prefer not to push themselves beyond a certain limit. There are various reasons for these different attitudes to work. In my view, passion for one’s work is a desirable quality in an employee, but too much hard work can be counter-productive and unhealthy.
There are three main reasons which encourage people to work hard.First, some people work extra shifts to earn more money. They believe that with the extra income earned, they can buy comforts for themselves and for their families. Second, newly employed people work for long hours to reach the targets set by the employer in order to secure their job. They fear that their employer will replace them with more competent people, if they fail to reach the target. Finally, there are people who are very passionate about their career and work. They work mindless of the passing of time or their family commitments to achieve their career goals and earn higher social status.
However, people who work hard usually face serious problems at the workplace and at home. To begin with, people doing long shifts are more likely to commit mistakes due to work pressure. As a result, they make huge loss to the company which they work for and lose job. Also, sometimes due to over load of work and odd working hours, people do not give time to their family. Consequently, arguments may arise between partners creating trouble in their relationship. Moreover, many studies have shown that there is an increase in the number of people suffering from stress disorder and other neurological illnesses due to extensive working hours.
To conclude, it is evident that hard work allows people to achieve their career goals and earn more money. However, working hard neglecting one’s health and family is never a risk worth taking.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-why-do-some-people-work-harder-than-others
625,Some people say that parents should encourage their children to take part in organised group activities in their free time. Others say that it is important for children to learn how to occupy themselves on their own. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Some people opine that children should spend their free time playing team sports or other group activities. Others counter / oppose this view. According to them, children should find a way to keep themselves engaged on their own. Both views will be discussed in this essay before arriving at a conclusion.
These days some parents want their kids to socialise and in their free time they have them join some group activities. Generally speaking, these kinds of activities can be some kind of dance classes, group discussions, robotic classes and sports which help them to learn important skills like coordination and cooperation. This prepares them for the future because they already know how to work with a group of people and have good team skills / spirit. Both qualities are essential for success at the workplace.
There are also parents who prefer to leave the children on their own, meaning they can do whatever they like to do. This can have both pros and cons. As for the advantages, it helps them to develop on their own and makes them more independent.  Children will also learn to work independently and this skill will be beneficial in those phases of life when they have to take decisions on their own.
On the flip side, if children are left alone, they may become aloof and that is not good at all. Such children may also get into bad or anti-social activities. For example, the notorious game Blue Whale primarily targets lonely children and many kids who play this game eventually commit suicide. Also some children may lack confidence if they spend their free time all by themselves.
To conclude, in my opinion / I think, we should get our children involved in group activities which keep them busy and give them an opportunity to learn from other kids.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-children-should-take-part-in-organized-group-activities-in-their-free-time

Do you think that the benefits of this outweigh the problems?","Nowadays, students are increasingly moving to a foreign country for higher education. In my opinion, advantages of this trend outweigh disadvantages.
There are a few disadvantages to moving to another country for higher education. Firstly, the students have to stay away from the comforts of their home. This can create stress and anxiety in them. They will miss the love and warmth they received from their parents. This can affect their performance in their studies. Secondly, moving to a foreign country for education is expensive. Usually students move to a developed country for higher education. Therefore, when they convert their currency to a foreign currency, they don’t have much money at their disposal.
However, the benefits of going abroad for higher education are truly remarkable. When students move to a rich country, they can enjoy the new facilities and advanced technologies which are not available in their developing native country. In addition to this, sometimes very few seats are available for certain courses in some developing countries. In this situation, too, relocating to a country where more seats are available for the same course is advantageous for the students.
Another benefit is that the students can learn a new culture. They can experience different kinds of exotic dishes, habits and practices. These experiences are often enjoyable and can make the students more tolerant of differences. Going overseas for education also helps the students to settle in a first world country with good job and this can increase their social status in their native country.
In conclusion, the upsides of foreign education are always greater than the downsides. However, students should carefully consider their options before going abroad.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-more-and-more-students-are-going-abroad-for-higher-studies

How can we solve these problems?","The depletion of consumable natural resources at an accelerated speed is a matter of grave concern since it has given birth to several problems in the world. Nevertheless, these issues can be resolved by taking some effective remedial steps.
The reduction in the green cover has had a negative effect on earth’s weather conditions. To elaborate, forests help to maintain the temperature of earth. The cutting down of trees at a fast pace for fulfilling human’s greed has created a climatic imbalance and the earth’s average temperature has risen by 2 degree Celsius in the last ten years. One of the biggest consequences of global warming is that our summers are getting hotter and hotter.
Furthermore, because of the depletion of fresh water resources, people are now forced to buy drinking water. The poor and the weaker sections of the society are the worst hit by the water crisis. Consequently, many people are dying due to lack of drinking water in African states and several others are left with only contaminated water for their daily use. Depleting oil resources also have had a negative impact on the automobile industry which relies almost wholly on oil for its operation.
However, some viable solutions do exist and it is possible to solve the aforementioned problems to a great extent. First, cutting down of trees should be checked, and industries which use wood for manufacturing their products, such as furniture and houses, should be encouraged to find eco-friendly alternatives. Second, the government and the media should launch campaigns that make people aware of the importance of saving water. It is also important to set a limit on the amount of water that can be used for domestic and industrial purposes. Third, scientists should be encouraged to find renewable fuels for vehicles. For instance, chargeable electric cars are gaining popularity in the US because they are eco-friendly and economical.
In conclusion, although the fast paced consumption of natural resources has directly influenced the climate of earth, the collaborative efforts of governments, scientists and the public can reduce the impact.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-natural-resources-are-being-consumed-at-an-alarming-rate

Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Some people say that increasing the number of sports facilities will greatly enhance public health. However, others oppose this view and believe that it will only help to some extent and other more effective measures are required to ensure public health. I strongly support the latter view.
There are people who opine that increasing the number of sports facilities will contribute to the betterment of public health. By this initiative, the government can motivate people to participate in various sports and become physically active and mentally fit. For example, sports will help them to burn out their excess calories and and also provide an opportunity to interact with others, which in turn, enhance their psycho-social well-being.
Having said that, the majority of the people believe that sports facilities alone cannot ensure the health of people. This is because the public comprises of people of different age-groups right from infants to seniors and it is not possible to ensure the participation of all of them in sports.
On the other hand, facilities like vaccination campaigns, free medical check-up, distribution of health supplements and health educational classes at public places will deliver better results. For instance, medical students conduct free health camps at public places on occasions like ‘World Diabetes Day’. Another case in point is the midday meal programme launched by the government of India in 1995. It provides free lunches to students in all government schools with the aim of improving their nutritional status. This scheme has not only encouraged parents to send their child to school but also resulted in enhancement of their health status. Therefore, it is evident that other measures contribute more to public health than sports facilities.

629,Music should not be taught in schools. Instead other subjects like computer and science should be taught. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Some people believe that music should not be part of the school curriculum, and only other subjects such as information technology, science and math should be taught. In my opinion, music might not be a subject that can directly help individuals in their professional life, yet there are indirect benefits that make music indispensable.
Admittedly, people who claim that music should not be taught at school believe it is no longer a subject that provides individuals with skills required to generate a sustainable income. Moreover, they think that the current job market favours professions related to artificial intelligence, mobile applications, finance and economy. These occupations require knowledge in subjects such as information technology, math and science.
On the other hand, although music might not open the doors to a successful career, it has an important influence on individuals and supports them in their personal and professional life. First, music helps the mental and spiritual growth of people. It is proven that listening to or playing certain kind of music helps individuals to relax, reduce stress and focus on their work. Secondly, music makes considerable contribution to enhancing the health of human beings. Many Medical studies have proven that playing certain music instruments reduces heart rates and blood pressure. For these reasons music will always be an essential subject that humans should not ignore. It helps them to find their inner peace and supports them in doing other activities and facing challenges.
In conclusion, I believe music might not be the subject that directly helps students in their future professional career; however, music can give important contribution to human’s spiritual and mental health which makes it indispensable.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-music-should-not-be-taught-in-schools

Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","According to some people / a few people, the external appearance and dressing style of a person can reflect their cultural values and personality traits. Personally, I disagree with the opinion that the choice of clothing should be used to deduce the character of a person.
Some of the sentiments and traditions can be inferred from the dressing one chooses to wear, but it is only limited to the externalities. For example, consider the Sikhs who wear the turban. It definitely gives us an idea about the background of the person and perhaps also his nationality. Likewise, most Muslim women wear burkha to show respect for their religion. However, a burkha only reveals the religion of a woman. It does not state anything about her character or personality.
A person’s lifestyle, preferences and habits, on the other hand, give more clues regarding their character and personality. For instance, I have personally met many people who dress modestly but live a life full of passion, ambition and adventure. Obviously, there is little we can deduce from their choice of clothes. Mahatma Gandhi, who earned India independence from the mighty British Empire, was greatly admired for his right conduct and honesty. He used to wear only a loin cloth to cover his body but he possessed great virtues unknown to many. At first, the British rulers chose to ignore him because they could never imagine that a half-naked fakir would one day shake the very foundations of their empire.
In conclusion, the choice of clothing or external appearances are not a reflection of a person’s culture or character. They can at best show whether a person is modern or traditional.

On the one hand, there are grounds to believe that employers need more than just the professional information to better assess their prospective candidates. With increasing emphasis on collaborative work culture and need for every employee to fit into the team dynamics, collecting extracurricular and personal information will help the employer select the right candidates and match them with right opportunities. For instance, several applicants may be deemed fit for a marketing position based on their qualification and work history. Those among them having special interests in traveling and meeting people are certainly more suited for this position and an employer needs to ask about their hobbies to figure this out.
Nonetheless, many of those who disagree with this argument doubt the authenticity of such information provided in the job applications. They believe that the job applicants tend to make up some hobbies and interests just to impress the employers.  According to a survey conducted by a student group from London School of Economics, only 40% of the respondents of a survey gave genuine answers when asked about their extracurricular interests.
In conclusion, while some are still doubtful of the veracity / truthfulness of information provided by candidates for a job position, it is believed that collecting this information greatly helps an employer in better decision making. In my opinion, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, and hence, the more information an employer gathers about an applicant, the better the decision making process will be.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-employers-sometimes-ask-for-personal-information-of-job-applicants
632,"In many countries, very few young people read newspapers or follow the news on TV. What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?","Young people no longer read newspapers or watch TV to keep themselves abreast of the happenings around the world.  This trend has been observed in most of the countries around the globe. The main reason behind this shift / change in preference is the increase in the popularity of a small gadget called smart phone and easy and cheap accessibility of the internet on it. The smart phone has, in fact, replaced not only the television and newspapers, but many other famous old-fashioned devices like computers, watches and cameras also.
However, we need to make sure that the young generation is not deprived of the benefits that newspapers and television channels provide. We also need to ensure that they are aware of the limitations of smart phones and the consequences of their overuse. Firstly, gadgets like TV and radio would bring the whole family together in the living room. Thus they created a sense of unity. By contrast, the smart phone isolates people from their family and friends. Also we cannot ignore the various health problems caused by the excessive use of mobile devices.
I feel that we should help the young generation understand the benefits of these age old means of communication that have been used for generations. The shift can be brought about only if we start from the grass root level such as primary or middle school. Use of mobile phones or tablets should be banned in the schools and children should be encouraged to read and gather more and more information from books and newspapers. Things like reading out newspaper headlines in the morning assembly or discussing the headlines from last night’s news bulletin in the class should be encouraged and rewarded with marks.
To conclude, the easy access to the internet on mobile devices like smart phones is the main reason that discourages young people from reading the newspaper or watching news channels on television. However, if parents and teachers make a spirited effort, it is still possible to inculcate reading habits in children again.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-young-people-no-longer-read-newspapers-or-watch-television
633,Some people consider price as the most important thing to think about when buying a product (such as cellphone) or service (e.g. medical treatment). Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that it is essential to consider the price before buying something. While I agree with the argument that people should think carefully before spending a large amount of money in order to avoid debt, in my opinion, the necessity of the purchase must play a role in the decision to buy.
It is essential that people should spend some time to analyse how much money they can spend to buy a particular item, and whether or not they can afford to buy it within the available budget. Over the last few decades, with the easy access to credit cards and bank loans, people are tempted to purchase luxurious and expensive items, which are actually not necessary, and later land themselves in trouble. For this reason, any item that is costly and is bought using credit ought to be given a serious thought. A good example of this would be the increase in the purchase of iPhones even among lower middle class people, owing to the flexible and interest free EMI options.
On the other hand, there are circumstances where the cost of an item or service becomes an irrelevant consideration. When someone’s life depends on a product or service such as medical treatment for a terminal disease, purchase of this service becomes crucial irrespective of the price. For example, bone marrow transfusion required for the treatment of a hemophilia patient costs around 50-60 lakhs, which is well beyond the budget of a middle class family. However, to save the life of their loved one, they have to pay this amount. Having said that, these situations are very rare and in most circumstances the price factor needs to be considered to control excess spending and avoid debt issues in the future.
In conclusion, people should plan thoroughly before spending large sums of money on goods and services, unless it is very important.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-price-is-the-most-important-thing-to-consider-when-buying-something
634,"Nowadays, people lack an understanding of how to manage their finances after they finish high school. Explain why they do not know how to manage money and how this can be changed.","Many young people are leaving high school without the vital and basic understanding of how personal finances ought to be managed in the real world. This is because they lack experience in handling money. Also, they don’t receive adequate financial education. On the bright side, this problem can be solved in two ways.
One of the main reasons why so many young students are unable to manage their own finances is that they are living with their parents. Owing to this, they are not needed to earn a salary or save money to pay bills and rent.  Another reason why students fail to handle money is due to the fact that the school curriculum does not include the subject on financial management. Most of the focus is given on teaching fundamental subjects like maths, science, history and languages and the important practical skills like money management are ignored. Thus, both teachers and parents are failing to prepare young people for the real life challenges.
This issue of young people’ inability to deal with money can be tackled in two ways. Firstly, parents should teach their children how money is earned, the monthly budget is prepared and expenses are planned to save a significant amount each month. One simple step in this direction would be giving pocket money to their children and asking them to keep a record of how they spend this money. Secondly, schools should incorporate important life skills in their curriculum for final year students. This will enable young people to learn how to manage their finances and avoid debt problems in future.
In conclusion, young people lack money management skills because of the negligence of parents and teachers. However, this can be tackled if both of them take the responsibility to train youngsters with the right skills.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-young-people-lack-the-ability-to-manage-their-finances
635,It is not wise for an industry to replace its experienced but old workers with new and young yet inexperienced individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Change is the law of nature and it applies to everyone including humans. While it appears unethical for an organization to replace its older employees with young people, I believe most of the times it becomes the need of the hour for that organization. This essay will analyze this trend from the perspective of workers and companies.
From the perspective of a company, certain kinds of jobs are both physically and intellectually demanding and sometimes it becomes necessary to replace an older employee with a young employee in such jobs. Physically demanding jobs such as those of coal miners or construction workers need rigorous physical work which an aged person may not be able to do with the same efficiency as a young person. Mentally demanding jobs such as that of an air traffic controller or an emergency medical practitioner demand quick response and an inability to deliver it can cost lives. As such, in such cases, companies do not have any other options and the replacement of older employees is imperative.
However, old and experienced employees ought to be retired gracefully with all the benefits rather than being shown the door one fine morning. In other words, it should be the prime responsibility of any enterprise to make sure their employees have a better life after their tenure is over with the enterprise. For instance, an organization should provide their experienced workers regular monthly pension along with free medical facilities so that they are not dependent on others. Upon closer examination it can be seen that this practice helps not only the retired employees but also the government by helping it reduce its spending on elderly health care.
To conclude, it is indeed true that replacement of older employees in various companies is a bitter truth in the co-operative sector.  Nonetheless, its negative impacts on the lives of replaced employees can be alleviated with the patronage of their employers.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-it-is-not-wise-for-a-company-to-replace-its-old-employees-with-young-employees
636,"Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some think that the retirement age should be increased as the lifespan of people has gone up significantly. I totally agree with this opinion since it will reduce the old age stress by a great extent. Many seniors are facing loneliness and financial difficulties due to early retirement. This essay explains how increasing the retirement age makes life less stressful and more joyous for seniors.
Raising / increasing the retirement age will definitely help old people to gain financial independence. As they grow older, there are more chances of medical issues and the need for money is high. Thus earning their own livelihood will give them the confidence that they can survive independently. Older people do not want to be a burden for their children.
Not only that, old people have much time to travel and explore new places, and hence having their own income will give them an opportunity to live their life as they wish. It should also be noted that thanks to their business lifestyle, young people cannot spend much time with their parents and grandparents. This bothers the old parents who stay at home all day and long for the attention of their family. Hence, working for a few more years beyond the existing retirement age may help them to focus on different activities and worry less about the family time spent with their children or grandchildren.
In conclusion, raising the age of retirement will benefit the old people in several ways and reduce their financial stress and mental trauma. So I firmly believe that this viable option would be advantageous to seniors. However, care should be taken that working at such an advanced age does not turn out to be physically strenuous to them. Rather it should only help them to live a happier and healthier life.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-as-people-live-longer-the-retirement-age-should-be-increased
637,Violence in media promotes violence in society. To what extent do you agree?,"Broadcasting violent content over the media leads to promotion of violence among people. This essay totally agrees with this statement because brutal videos telecasted have a negative impact on the young minds and terror outfits use social media to promote hatred among people.
Young children, on an average, spend around 5-6 hours of time watching videos over television, such as movies or cartoons. Most of the movies today have some form of physical violence like, a brutal murder, communal riots and rape. As a result, these young ones are exposed to crime and brutality at a very young age and start believing that it is alright to resort to violence, if the need arises. This can be illustrated by an increase in the number of incidences of physical abuse among school children. Recently, a sixth class student studying in a very reputed school in Mumbai murdered his junior because the later did not give him the seat in school bus.
Furthermore, many terror groups utilize the social media to float videos of mass killings, people getting slaughtered in the name of religion with a motive to create unrest among the people and divide them based on religion. They mislead public by showing this content and encourage to join hands with them. For instance, one of the most dreaded terror outfits,ISIS, targets people from Muslim community and instills ill will in their minds for other religions and motivates them to get indulged in violent activities.
In conclusion, media exposes young children to barbarity at a very tender age and also helps in spreading communal violence.

638,Some people consider price as the most important thing to think about when buying a product (such as cell phone) or service (e.g. medical treatment). Do you agree or disagree?,"Price is the main consideration of some people, when it comes products or services. While I agree that it is essential to spend our money wisely, I believe that money should not always be the main element. To begin with, it is indeed essential to control our spending to avoid falling into the debt trap.
We should take into account the level of necessity, when opting for a product or service. Consider this situation. Two products serve the exact same purpose but are sold at different prices. In this case, it is important to take the price into account.Taking handbags as an example, consumers could either go for a quality handbag sold at a reasonable price or a designer’s handbag sold at a highly marked-up price. In my opinion, the latter is not necessary and should be avoided.
However, there are occasions where price tags should be ignored completely. These include health and medical related expenses. The amount of money spent should never be a priority in these circumstances, as any delay in availing the service may lead to a life-threatening situation.  In the event that the required amount is more than what the patient could afford, they should still proceed by seeking help from medical insurances or loans. This is because repayment plans could always be set up once they regain their health.
In conclusion, money should not always be the most important consideration. In my opinion, purchasing decisions should be made only after evaluating the need for the product or service. If it is absolutely essential, money cannot be the deciding factor.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-price-is-the-most-important-thing-to-consider-when-you-buy-something
639,Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school. Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.,"People have different opinions of whether home schooling is better than a formal education / regular schooling. While I admit that regular schooling enhances a child’s social skills, in my opinion, home schooling up to a certain age is beneficial in some other aspects. In this essay, I will discuss the plus points of both approaches and share my view.
To begin with, children acquire much more academic knowledge when they attend a regular school. The traditional education system promotes a balanced curriculum, covering other non-academic areas including arts, music, sports and so on. As result, children are guided to discover their unique talents, which parents could then continue to nurture. Furthermore, learning in a classroom enables children to interact with their classmates, and at the same time, understand the importance of teamwork. In my opinion, these group activities will shape their personality / character and teach them to respect and care for others as they grow up.
On the other hand, home-schooling might be beneficial in the earlier stage as parents could tailor the curriculums and emphasise on the areas that their child is weak in. For example, one child might face difficulties in math while most of their classmates find writing skills challenging. The home schooling system does not require slow learners to keep up pace with academically bright students. In addition, learning at home during the earlier stages will protect children from potentially negative influences at school.
In conclusion, I believe that both methods possess their own advantages and parents should take into account their child’s personality when making the choices. As for myself, I would first teach my children at home and only send them to school around the age of 10.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-home-schooling-vs-regular-schooling
640,"Reading books keeps a person’s mind active, whereas watching films and television is passive and does not require a person to use their imagination. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Studies have shown that brain activity peaks when someone reads a book and this is not surprising. While readers use their imagination and keep their brain active, television audiences do not need to imagine any scene and hence their brain remains inactive. This essay, therefore, agrees with the given statement that reading makes the mind active because in a book the author uses words to describe situations and readers imagine the complete context but television programmes explicitly show what they want you to see.
When we read a book we have to create images in the mind. The process of reading a book requires some preparation as well. Readers have to choose a book, buy it and spend hours and hours reading it. Using imagination is a key aspect of reading because the writer only describes situations and characters with words and the reader has to imagine every scene in the mind. For example, a recent survey by Colorado University found that 85% of people who read the same book are likely to describe the characters differently. This shows how imagination plays a crucial role while reading a book.
On the other hand, television audience do not imagine situations. Films and television programmes already have their characters, places and situations, which limit the use of the audience’s imagination. Watching a movie just requires a person to sit in front of the screen without even thinking about the situations because they are already filmed. To illustrate, many people opined that they preferred reading the book called “Fifty Shades of Gray”, because the film’s characters and places were not as good as in the book.
To conclude, it is not hard to see that television audience stay passive in front of the TV while readers actively use their imagination to visualise the scenes and characters portrayed in the book.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-reading-keeps-a-persons-mind-active
641,"Young people’s ideas and attitudes are different from their parents and grandparents. How do you think these differences in ideas and attitudes exist in your society? In your opinion, do they cause problems to society?","It is true that the younger generation have totally different thoughts and behaviours than older generations. These thoughts and behaviours differ in many ways and,in my opinion, they cause some issues to our communities. Let me elaborate.
To begin with, the thoughts and behaviours of younger generations vary in many ways from those of older generations. Firstly, there is a huge difference in how older and younger generations generate their ideas. For example, in my home country of Sudan, older people always consult their friends if they have any thought, while younger generation depend on the internet for generating their ideas. As a result, older generations’ thoughts are better than those of younger generation because not all information on the internet is accurate. Furthermore, older generations generate thoughts from their personal stories. Inventors such as Newton benefited us by making ideas out of their stories. So, there are many differences in how older and younger generations generate their thoughts.
Although variations in thought and behaviours between generations have benefits, they cause some problems to our communities. First of all, such variations can make communication between older and younger people more difficult because there are differences in how they think and behave. This can cause problems to our communities. In addition, such variations could make people disrespect each other as some people might not appreciate and respect different ideas and behaviours and this can lead to disagreements within communities.
To sum up, thoughts and behaviours of younger generation vary in many ways from those of older generations. Lack of communication and disagreement within communities are some issues this kind of variation causes.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-young-peoples-attitudes-are-different-from-those-of-old-people
642,"Today more and more tourists are visiting places where the conditions are difficult, such as the Sahara desert or The Antarctic. What are the benefits and disadvantages for tourists who visit such places?","Tourists these days are showing an interest in visiting places with harsh conditions. For some people traveling to such places will be a unique experience because it is not something you get to experience in your day-to-day life. However, there are some downsides to this kind of trips because they might compromise people’s health and fitness. This essay will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of visiting dangerous or off-beat locations.
Visiting a place that could pose a threat to your life may be exciting for some travelers and this feeling could actually enhance your appreciation for life and health. People are amazed by the sort of scenery and landscape that they might find in isolated places untouched by humans. This allows them to find a connection with their inner self. Witnessing the wonders of the nature also allows people to find a new purpose in life and look at the world in a different light.
Also, for some people traveling to uninhabited and peaceful places could improve their health in several ways. For example, in 2016, the University Of Cambridge reported that people who lived for a month in the Brazilian Jungle improved their sight by sixty percent in comparison to those who lived their regular life in the city.
On the other hand, traveling to locations with difficult conditions might create a problem to those tourists who are mentally weak or addicted to technology. The feeling of isolation could make them feel homesick and they may get depressed and cut the trip short before visiting the best parts. To illustrate, a survey done by The Institute of Tourism in Africa showed that almost twenty-five percent of tourists crossing the Sahara desert did not finish the tour because they were feeling isolated and the conditions were too extreme for them. As a result they had to be evacuated by an emergency helicopter.
To conclude, exploring places that have an uncommon condition could be a positive trip for some people looking for a spiritual experience or a health improvement. However, for those who are afraid of losing their comfort zone and the connection with the 21st century, this kind of excursion might be a disappointing idea due to the facilities that these places lack.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-more-and-more-tourists-are-visiting-dangerous-places
643,"In many places, new homes are needed, but the only space available for building them is in the countryside. Some people believe it is more important to protect the countryside and not build new homes there. What is your opinion?","In many parts of the world, there has been an animated discussion about whether or not to build new homes in the countryside. Some people argue that building new houses in the countryside is less important than the protection of these zones. I agree with this view. In my opinion, the countryside is the most important place for any civilization because it is where the majority of food and cattle grow to feed people in the cities.
Developing suburbs in those areas that are being used for an agricultural purpose might have egregious consequences for the cities. Farmers have been growing crops in these places for many decades or even centuries. They know the weather patterns and the soil conditions of these places. Building new homes in these areas could create a huge problem for farmers as they may have to relocate to an unknown zone. Since they do not know the soil conditions or the weather patterns of the new place, they may get a poor harvest which will lead to an increase in the price of essential items. To illustrate, in 2014 The Daily Mail reported that in Geelong, Australia the use of farmland for building purposes caused rice prices to skyrocket as production was halved. This forced Australians to buy rice from overseas at higher prices than they used to buy before the new development.
Farm animals will have to be relocated to new lands if the space available is assigned to new developments. Animals living in the countryside have a certain type of grass or food in their diet, and these nutrients might not be available in the new location. This could lead to many diseases and an increase in veterinarian expenses. For example, a study done by The University of California showed that in San Diego the relocation of cattle added a new type of bacteria to the milk. This caused the waste of more than one million liters of milk and the hospitalization of several people.
To conclude, in my point of view, the preservation of countryside is vital for the survival of human beings and using this space for the purpose of building new living spaces might create consequences that are going to cost more than finding new locations for these properties to be built. Crops might be affected, production may reduce and animals may develop new diseases that might also affect the inhabitants of the area.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-believe-that-the-countryside-should-not-be-used-for-building-new-homes
644,Rich countries are getting richer while poor countries are getting poorer. What is the cause of this? What could be done to solve this problem?,"The gap between rich and poor countries is widening these days. Due to good governance and low levels of corruption in first world countries they are achieving high growth when compared to third world countries. However, poor countries can catch up with them by implementing strict laws and reforms.
To begin with, rich countries have significantly higher growth rates because of zero tolerance towards corruption. They value talent and make sure that talented people have no dearth of opportunities in their country. This allows them to attract huge investments and thus create new employment opportunities. In addition, rich nations enforce laws which favor companies to expand their presence. Companies in turn pay taxes to these nations and help them grow financially. For these reasons, first world countries can maintain a very healthy growth rate.
Poor countries need to follow similar growth models and focus on improving their economy. Firstly, they need to implement tax reforms so that multi-national companies do not face any hassles when expanding their base in these countries. Secondly, corruption by officials is very high in these countries and it has a direct impact on people’s lives. Often times, skilled people do not have enough opportunities in these nations and this forces them to migrate to other countries. Strict anti-corruption laws need to be implemented to ensure proper governance. In addition, the government should proactively create opportunities to prevent brain drain.
To conclude, the economic disparity between countries is growing. In my opinion, high levels of corruption and poor governance are the main causes of poverty in poor countries.

645,Some people say a person’s success in adult life is the result of the way they were brought up as a child by their parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that a person’s success in adult life is a result of upbringing they received. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, the success of a person is very much a result of their hard work and perseverance.
Upbringing is certainly important, but just because a child is brought up well, there is no guarantee that they will be successful in their adult life. Although parents are the ultimate teachers and guides of a child, many people grow up either without their parents or against their parents’ principles. Quite a few people learn to live life or make it big in life without family support or help. There have been many such success stories. For example, many wealthy businessmen on the Wall Street were orphans; yet they earned success from scratch.
Talent, skills and hard work coupled with experience are important factors in any successful individual’s life. People grow from their experiences or situations .Their success depends upon their ability to learn from their mistakes. Life choices also play a prime role in shaping an individual’s success path. For example, the friends or company we keep could affect our life tremendously.
To conclude, no matter whether an individual is born with a silver spoon in their mouth or to wealthy parents, ultimately it is their perseverance and hard work that take them to places.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","How people spend their money is very much their personal choice. Some people believe that they should save for the future; others insist that they should spend their money to enjoy a better life. In my point of view, saving money is an absolute necessity, but it shouldn’t be achieved at the cost of limiting basic needs and recreational activities.
On the one hand, it’s extremely important for people to understand their needs and wants. Irrespective of age and gender, each individual has their own desires to fulfill. People these days are working hard to get more money so that they can live in a bigger house and drive a more comfortable car. A recent study in the US revealed that middle class people spend more money on traveling than on rentals or loans. It is interesting to know that families with kids want to travel around the world to experience difficult cultures. One has to spend money to fulfill these desires.
On the other hand, it’s equally important to curtail one’s spending. It is not uncommon for rich people to spend inordinate amounts of money on luxury goods and an extravagant lifestyle. Unfortunately, excessive spending can land people in trouble. A person’s financial situation can change any time. A sudden illness or job loss can land anyone in deep financial trouble. I myself have seen many old couples forced to live on government assistance. They used to earn well but because of their excessive spending habits they could not save anything for their twilight years.
To conclude, it is evident that in order to live comfortably throughout one’s life, it is important to spend and save money wisely.",8,band-8-essay-sample-should-people-spend-their-money-or-save-it

Do you think that the benefits outweigh the problems?","Nowadays there is a sudden increase in the number of students wanting to study at international universities.While there are some drawbacks to this trend, I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh the demerits.
On the one hand, there are some limitations to sending students to overseas universities. Firstly, many of them have never left their home before this event in their entire life. It would be very normally difficult for such students to cope up well with the entirely new environment. Most of the time, they feel homesick and due to this, they struggle in their studies. On the bright side every university runs counselling units particularly for overseas students so that they adjust themselves very well. Secondly, foreign students are more vulnerable when they are away from their family and close friends. This can create problems for them and they may easily indulge in illegal activities such as drug abuse.
On the other hand, studying abroad helps students to broaden their mental outlook towards the world as a whole. In class they have to work with students of different nationalities on group projects which nurture their team skills. As a result, they experience change in their overall personality. Furthermore, they get an opportunity to study in ultra-modern universities with high-technology and tie-ups with various industries. Having an overseas degree provides an edge to the student in the international job market.
In conclusion, I think an overseas qualification not only improves chances of employment but also develops the overall personality of the student. While there are some limitations to this trend, in my opinion, the advantages of getting an international degree outweigh the disadvantages.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-more-and-more-students-want-to-study-at-international-universities
648,Essay topic: Some people believe that wild animals that live in urban areas should be killed; others argue that they should be protected. Discuss both views and state your opinion.,"In some urban areas it is common to see forest animals and birds nowadays, as they have begun to migrate to cities due to rapidly lessening forest areas. While some people believe that we should hunt them down, others are eager to protect them. I strongly agree with the latter view as animals have equal rights to live on this earth.
The main reason why several people want to kill them is that they are afraid of their own safety. Stranded animals in the cities may not have enough food and might attack pedestrians. For instance, in 2015 a lion in Delhi killed a young man and injured several others. Furthermore, these animals might cause damage to the property. The gardens, parked vehicles, and statues would be easy targets. In addition, they make the city dirty by littering everywhere.
However, hunting them down is not the only option to solve the above mentioned problems. There are other alternative ways as well. Firstly, the government  should depute a special trained team to capture these animals and birds and send them to national parks or their habitat. For example, in 2013, Indian government formed a special team to capture stranded monkeys in Kolkata and released them in a dense forest. Secondly, people should build strong compound walls to protect their property from these wild animals. Proper fencing would limit animal movements. Finally, if the governments take necessary actions to rebuild their natural habitat, they will not come to city areas.
In conclusion, it is evident that wild animals cause a lot of problems in the cities. However, killing them is not the only possible solution. If the above stated measures are taken then we would not have any problem from these creatures. Moreover, it is their fundamental right as well to live on the earth.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-wild-animals-living-in-cities-should-be-killed
649,Many criminals commit further crime as soon as they are released from prison. What do you think are the causes of this? What possible solutions can you suggest?,"Crime rate has increased manifold these days. In spite of the punishment, many convicts tend to repeat crimes once they get released from jail. I think there are several reasons for this behaviour. In my opinion, it is the responsibility of the government and the society to solve this problem.
There are many reasons that encourage criminals to commit crimes again. The most important ones are social stigma, lack of emotional support and poor job opportunities. Criminal background drastically decreases job opportunities as no employer prefers to appoint an employee with criminal record. This leaves them with no career options and thus no financial support.  Many times, these criminals are not accepted by their own families and this makes them lonely and homeless. In addition to this, people don’t want ex-convicts to reside in their communities and treat them with suspicion. All these factors lead to hopelessness and directly or indirectly promote violence.
However, these problems can be avoided to a large extent by government’s intervention as well as changes in people’s outlook towards these culprits. Jail inmates should be taught about the best possible ways to handle life in the most difficult situations and this will prevent them from committing crimes again. The government should organise schemes that provide financial assistance and train them in useful jobs. Constant psychological counselling is necessary for the criminals and their families to rebuild personal relationships. The society should also change their mindset and attitude towards prisoners and provide them with the necessary emotional support to become responsible individuals.
To conclude, though there are quite a number of factors which encourage criminals to commit crimes again, I am of the opinion that the government and the society should take the responsibility to rehabilitate ex-criminals so as to prevent them from committing further crimes.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-many-criminals-commit-crimes-again-after-serving-time-in-prison
650,"By paying more to employees on the basis of their performance, the employer can keep their motivation high. Do you agree this is the best way to encourage employees?","It is argued that in order to keep employees highly motivated, employers should pay higher salary based on their performance. While I agree with that opinion to some extent, I would argue that there is a better way to encourage people to work harder.
Admittedly, money plays a crucial role in our modern life and most people work hard to earn a higher salary. For example, a lot of employees, who work at Google Inc answered in a recent survey that they were more likely to work more efficiently when the company gave higher prize such as money or commissions. Moreover, salary based on the performance may give the lazy workers a warning that if they are not working harder they will not be paid well. As a result, these employees will have to change their attitudes and concentrate on their tasks.
However, I believe that giving a promotion frequently is a better way to keep employees motivated. For many people, money is not as important as other aspects such as holding a high position or being a key member in a company. For instance, despite the high salary that talented engineers could get from Tesla, they decided to quit their job and work for Apple Corporation where they could get promoted to senior level positions. So, a lot of large companies are now offering high position as an effective way to retain the motivational levels of their employees.
In conclusion, rewarding good performance with a high salary is definitely a good way to keep the workforce more efficient. However, I believe that giving them a promotion is a better way to keep them motivated.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-employers-should-pay-higher-salaries-to-keep-employees-motivated
651,Should the same laws which prohibit the sale & consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.,"Since time immemorial, narcotics have been the root cause of many issues in the society. Drug abuse leads an individual to a vicious circle which has no end. In fact in the worst cases a person even gets isolated from the society as well as his family. Even though the government has launched several programs to eradicate drugs from the society, they keep coming back in one form or the other.
This is because it’s available in various forms due to which it gets affordable as well. The sale as well as consumption of a drug called “Heroin” has already been banned by the government so masses have moved towards another option called “Tobacco”. Tobacco is majorly found in cigarettes which are the root cause of dreadful diseases like lung or mouth cancer.  These drugs make people so much dependent on them that they start to cut themselves off from the society and work.
Later due to scarcity of money drug addicts even end up getting involved in criminal activities. Slowly from being an invaluable part of the society they end up being a burden on their family, society and country. Families of the drug addicts suffer the most because they have neither the money to run the household nor the ability to take care of the addict.
Therefore, in my opinion, the government should prohibit the sale and consumption of tobacco just like it banned heroin. Drugs not only eat up the society like termites but also jeopardize the health and prosperity of future generations.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-laws-that-prohibit-the-sale-of-heroin-should-be-applied-to-tobacco-as-well
652,Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?,"Traffic congestion and pollution have become major problems worldwide. Pollution is particularly worse in big cities. Already several suggestions are being put forward to solve this. One of them is to augment the price of fuel. However, I believe that there are plenty of other more effective solutions.
Raising the price of fuel is a short term measure. While this might reduce the number of vehicles on the road, it is largely a negative decision because it affects not only the use of motor vehicles, but also the price of food and other goods. In Chile, my home country, everything relies on transport, so the price of petrol has a big domino impact on what people end up paying even for a slice of bread.
More creative solutions that will work In the long run are what we need to face these issues. For example, increasing the investment in alternative fuels and improving public transport are some of the ideas that I think will reduce the usage of private transport and consequently air pollution. Individual initiatives like sharing rides are also good ideas. In one of my favourite cities, Amsterdam, this problem is being tackled by investing in excellent infrastructure for bikes, so cycling has increased, cars are banned from the city centre and people have found alternative means of transport.
To conclude, the rising population and the worsening air quality have made it imperative for governments and individuals to adopt change and reduce the use of private transport. I am certain that there are better and more effective solutions to solve traffic problems than increasing petrol price.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-increasing-the-price-of-petrol-is-the-best-solution-for-traffic-congestion-and-air-pollution
653,"Over time, as children grow older, the relationship they have with their parents changes. In your opinion, what role should parents have in their adult children’s lives? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","As young people move from adolescence to adulthood, the nature of their relationship with their parents typically changes from dependence to a more equal, mutually supportive relationship between adults. In my opinion, even after children have grown into adults, parents still have an important role in their life. For example, they can continue to give emotional support to their grown up children.
Adulthood is the stage of life when a person has to bear a lot of responsibilities and face different kinds of challenges. At such times, lack of experience to manage responsibilities and pressure of challenges may put a person in stressful situations. It is in these situations that they badly need the guidance and the emotional support of their parents. In fact parental support can turn hard times into great opportunities to learn and improve.
Various studies have shown that emotional support is the most desired form of help that every adult requires and none other than parents can offer it in abundance. In addition to emotional support, parents can pass down values to their children. It is often believed that the right set of values and appropriate approach towards various aspects of life leads to a peaceful, happy and satisfied life which is the ultimate goal for most people. Adulthood is also the period of life when one has to unlearn some values or philosophy and learn fresh ones instead. And at this stage of confusion, our parents can teach us the right set of values and attitudes to lead a happy life.
In conclusion, as children grow up, parents’ role changes from that of caregivers to that of a guide or emotional support system.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample
654,Some people support the development of agricultural practice such as factory farming and harvesting new types of fruits and vegetables while others oppose? Discuss both views and give your opinion,"While some people encourage new techniques and practices in agriculture, others argue that we should rely on organic farming methods to lead a healthy life. In my opinion, it is important to update our agricultural practices.
People are getting more and more concerned about the quality of the food they eat. However, till date we have not got anything to prove that the consumption of these new types of foods is hazardous to health. In order to feed millions of people around the globe, producing foods by implementing modern techniques is imperative. GM foods do not cause harm as they are grown by minimal usage of pesticides. Additionally, they are resistant to pests, droughts and floods and help the farmers to gain good yield at a lower cost.
For example, rich people can afford to consume organic food while the common people cannot consume them. Instead they can eat GM foods. Factory farms produce foods faster than traditional farms. That means they can produce large amount of eggs, meat and milk. Even the poor can afford these foods. As the population increases, the need for food also increases.
On the other hand, some people are very particular about the quality of the food they consume. Firstly, these farming methodologies are implemented by modifying the genetics of the plants and animals to make them more resistant to unexpected diseases. That means they are not grown naturally. By this practice we are harming their natural growth process to feed the growing population every year. Secondly, genetically modified or factory farms products are observed to have unusual taste and they may also lack rich proteins and nutrients. Finally, to produce tons of eggs and meat, factory farms are usually maintained in unsanitary conditions. This may contribute to health problems in animals which in turn might lead to health problems in people who consume them.
In conclusion, we should support the advancements in agricultural methodologies in the current era where food demand is high, but we should do proper research to ensure the quality of these foods.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-support-factory-farming-and-gm-crops

I am writing to express my interest in attending a training course called ‘Introduction to Supply Chain’. I came across its advertisement in the newspaper. It’s a 6 month part time course starting 2nd December and classes will be held twice a week on week days in the evenings from 4 pm to 8 pm.
I am sharing this information because I am pretty much convinced that the course will not only help in enhancing my skills but will also provide more clarity on logistics. As you know, in exports logistics play a crucial role as correct methods would not only help us in cost reduction but also ensure safe delivery of end product.

656,Nowadays young people lack an understanding of how to manage their finances after they finish high school. Explain why they do not know how to manage money and how this can be changed.,"Many young people do not have a basic understanding of financial management when they leave school. This lack of knowledge is primarily due to the upbringing and limited education at school.
One main reason is that the young people are dependent on their parents and they get everything for free until secondary education. Parents always want their children to be happy and successful and in order to achieve that they hide the financial pressure and provide them with sufficient money. The second reason is the curriculum at school. Subjects such as mathematics, science or languages included in the syllabus do not teach real life skills. As a result, both parents and teachers fail to prepare their children for the real world.
This is indeed a cause for concern but fortunately, there are some solutions. Parents should consider giving children a certain amount of money every month and insist that it should last them a whole month. This will encourage the child to monitor their spending habits. As the child grows, they should teach them how household expenses are managed and also involve them in decision making. Apart from these, they can give the child the responsibility of running the household for a day or two.
Secondly, the school authorities ought to include the subject on life management skills in the final year of the curriculum. This will help a student to learn how their finances need to be budgeted and managed.
In conclusion, it is crucial for young people to learn financial management skills apart from the regular course and both parents and teachers play a vital role in achieving this by equipping them with the right knowledge.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-young-people-do-not-know-how-to-manage-their-money
657,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.,"In certain countries some people think that students who just finished high school should take a year off for travelling or working before they enroll in a university. In my opinion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to taking a gap year.
There are a number of drawbacks to taking a year off to travel or work between high school and university. Firstly, if young people decide to work, they might get used to receiving an income and because of this there is a possibility that they do not want to come back to the student life anymore. Secondly, most of the students are too young to travel by themselves; therefore they could waste this opportunity because of their naivety.  Finally, travelling for a whole year requires a huge amount of money which could be spent on university studies.
On the other hand, there are some benefits to spending a year working or travelling before joining university. To begin with, young people broaden their minds when they travel and this might help them to gain valuable experiences in life. A further positive aspect is that while travelling or working, young people could acquire maturity and this could allow them to perform better once they return to their studies. A final benefit is that young people will probably learn some skills such as speaking a different language. They will also learn to appreciate other countries and cultures.
Overall, there are as many advantages as there are disadvantages to travelling or working between high school and university. In my opinion, it all depends on the students’ intellectual and emotional maturity to face this challenge and take advantage of it.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-students-should-take-a-gap-year-between-high-school-and-university
658,"Some people think that having a set retirement age (e.g. 65 years) for everybody, regardless of occupation, is unfair. They believe that certain workers deserve to retire and receive a pension at an earlier stage. Do you agree or disagree?Which type of workers do you think should benefit from early retirement?","Many people believe that fixing the age limit for retirement at 65 without considering the nature of their occupation is a rude policy. They argue that exception should be given to certain occupations which involve physical and emotional stress. I agree with them.
A good reason to lower the age limit for retirement is that it eases the stress and pain of elderly people who are involved in hard physical labour. Generally speaking there is a lot of pressure in the working environment like achieving the month end targets. In order to meet these targets they are forced to work for longer hours which may not possible at their age. Another point to consider is that they may have lost their strength as they have been working for 25 to 30 years.
Due to this they may not be able to work as efficiently as they did in the past. Finally, it is essential for all people to stay fit and healthy. Elder people are more likely to fall ill than others. This is because they have a weak immune system. That is the reason doctors advise their elderly patients to stop working at a certain age.
Employees working in certain sectors will benefit from early retirement. For example, drivers should retire early. For driving we need more concentration throughout the work. So, people who crossed sixty might not be able to focus on their job for a long time. The same rule is applicable to air trafficking controllers, emergency rescue teams and people involved in mining activities.
To conclude, there are certain occupations which involve physical and emotional stress. So people working in these occupations should be provided the option of voluntary retirement if they think they are not fit.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-having-a-set-retirement-age-for-all-employees-is-unfair
659,Some people think that in order to solve traffic and transportation problems people should be encouraged to live in cities rather than in suburbs or countryside. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"The number of cars on the roads is increasing every day. Traffic and transportation issues are a growing concern in every major city. Many people believe that in order to solve traffic and transportation woes people should be encouraged to live in cities rather than in the suburbs or countryside. I strongly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, there are several other ways to solve this issue.
Firstly, encouraging people to live in the cities may have a detrimental effect on the population and environment. Overcrowding of the cities is a major issue in the world today. Also, cities are expensive and people may not have the funds necessary to reside in the city. Lack of good public transportation facilities is the prime reason for traffic congestion in cities, because this encourages people to use their own vehicles. In addition, poor traffic co-ordination especially during peak hours, repairing of roads and other problems slow vehicular movement.
The government and civic authorities should increase the frequency of their public transportation services. In order to ensure public convenience and satisfaction, services should be scheduled in a timely manner. It is also important to ensure the quality of roads and to eliminate bottlenecks which hamper traffic flow. Organizations should provide transport facilities for staff who travel long distances. Carpooling is the best way to mitigate traffic woes and individuals should be encouraged to do this.
To conclude, there are a number of solutions to traffic and transportation woes. The government and the people should work hand in hand to combat this issue.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-in-order-to-solve-traffic-problems-people-should-live-in-cities
660,Some people feel that children should be educated in single sex schools; others argue that mixed schools are better. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Education plays an important role in everyone’s life. Some countries have single-sex schools while others have both single-sex and co-educational schools. In my opinion, it is up to the parents to decide which model is ideal for their children.
It is believed that there is less room for distraction in single-sex schools. As a result, students focus on their studies with all their attention. Gender based prejudices do not exist in single sex schools and students can pursue whatever subject they like without any inhibitions. For example, girls in single sex schools tend to pursue science at a higher level. Similarly, boys at single-sex schools are more likely to take cookery classes or learn a language, despite the fact that these are often thought of as traditional subjects for girls.
On the other hand, mixed schools prepare their students for future life where both genders need to co-exist, be it at home, university or office. Boys and girls learn to live and work together from a younger age and are emotionally mature in their relations with their opposite sex. They also happen to learn from each other and may pick up some new skills or traits. Developing mutual respect for one another is another positive. They are also sensitive in their dealings with members of the opposite sex.
I think that both models of schooling have their merits and demerits. It depends on the institute and how well a child adapts to his or her surroundings. Parents play the most crucial role here because ultimately it is their decision.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-single-sex-schools-vs-co-ed-schools
661,"Employer sometimes ask people applying for jobs for personal information, such as their hobbies and interests and whether they are married or single. Some people say that this information may be relevant and useful. Others disagree.","Nowadays, many organizations ask their candidates personal details such as their leisure activities and marital status.
By doing this they want to have more information about job seekers .This is being welcomed by the majority  but a few people disagree with this practice. They are not comfortable with sharing their personal particulars; however, in my opinion sharing information has its own benefits.
To begin with, there is no harm in sharing personal details with employers during interviews because that information will help the employer to decide whether the candidate is good for the job and the organization. To exemplify, a lady is recently married and she needs time to adjust in a new family but the job opening requires utmost dedication to work. In this situation, the employer gains from knowing her marital status. The woman is also spared the trouble of working in an organisation that demands too much of her time. In addition, having knowledge of hobbies and other preferred recreational activities of employers allow employers to have a comprehensive data base based on which future outings and vacations can be organised.
On the flip side, there are a few demerits to sharing personal details with companies. Firstly, companies and recruitment agencies may get into extensive details which make the applicant uncomfortable at times.  Secondly, people don’t feel at ease while sharing their personal information to strange interviewers. Lastly, different people have different choices, and a few hobbies are unconventional, which individuals don’t want to disclose.
In the final analysis, it is evident that there is a need to draw a line. Organizations can ask personal information; however, they should not ask questions that may annoy or upset the candidates.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-employers-are-asking-for-too-much-personal-information
662,The number of older people is increasing. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?,"The ageing population is a problem that many countries now face. While it is true that seniors contribute to the society in many ways, in my opinion, having a large population of older people has more disadvantages than advantages.
Seniors can certainly contribute to the society in some ways. They, undoubtedly, have accumulated more knowledge over the years compared to their younger counterparts. They are possibly the best persons to get advice from as they have encountered almost every situation that one is expected to encounter in their lives. They also have in-depth knowledge on different life or career experiences. Thus, the younger generation can easily entrust them with taking care of their children. This is usually the area wherein youngsters lack valuable knowledge and expertise.
Yet, I believe that there are more disadvantages than advantages to having a large population of seniors. Older people are the most unproductive lot in the workforce of a nation. Most of them are dependent on their children because they are unable to work and retire as a result. Besides, at a certain age, they are more susceptible to developing numerous diseases and illnesses. Therefore, medical care is an utmost requirement and it comes with a hefty price. Nursing homes are not cheap either and caring for elderly sick people is never an easy feat. In other words, they are deemed as a financial burden on their children. Even those who choose to continue working are unwilling or unable to pick up new skills and knowledge to keep up with the technology.
To sum up, the drawbacks of having a large ageing population definitely outweigh the benefits. Economically, the ageing population does not add much value to the society.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-the-number-of-older-people-is-increasing
663,Human activity has had a negative impact on plants and animals around the world. Some people say that it is too late to do something while others think that actions can be taken to improve the situation. Discuss both sides of the view and give your opinion.,"It is undoubtedly true that some of our activities have a harmful effect on our planet. While some people believe that nothing can be done to solve the negative impact of human activity on the wildlife, I strongly argue that several measures can be taken to solve the problem.
To begin with, some people are of the opinion that the damaging effect of some of our activities on the wildlife cannot be resolved. This, in their opinion, is because many species of plants and animals have already disappeared from our world and it is impossible to get them back. For example, in 2013, a United Nations study found out that several species disappeared from our ecosystem because of deforestation. This clearly shows the depth of the bad effects that our activities have on the wildlife. So, in these people’s opinion nothing can be done to reverse the problem.
Nevertheless, I insist that there are many measures that governments and individuals can take to stop the negative effect that our activities have on our planet. First of all, governments around the world must come together to address the issue of deforestation. This is because it is the main cause of the disappearance of endangered species. For example, the South African government outlawed deforestation in 2015 and since then the results have been impressive as many species have been saved from extinction and soil erosion has been stopped. As a result, the endangered species now have no disruption in their habitats and the production of crops has increased. Individuals can also spread awareness about the destructive effect that some of our activities have on the planet. Obviously there are still many more things that we can do to address the issue.
To sum up, I definitely maintain that governments and individuals can do several things to stop human activity that has damaging effects on our planet. Outlawing deforestation and spreading awareness amongst people about the need to protect wildlife are the actions that need to be taken.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-human-activity-has-had-a-negative-effect-on-plants-and-animals
664,The government should allocate more funding to teach science rather than other subjects in order for a country to develop and progress. To what extent do you agree?,"Science plays an important role in the growth and progress of a nation. However, other subjects are also important for the economic development of a country. Therefore, I believe that the government should allot equal funds for the teaching of all subjects.
Science subjects are definitely helpful. They help to solve many problems affecting us and our environment. Government funding will lead to improvement in medical research and the invention of many cures. Health, after all, is wealth. In order for a nation to progress, its people have to be healthy. Research in medical science facilitates this. In addition, scientific research in agriculture can increase the fertility of the land and result in economic growth. Science subjects like technology and engineering also play a crucial role in making our lives happy and comfortable. Obviously, the government funding of science subjects helps the country to develop and progress.
However, this does not mean that only science subjects are important. Other subjects like arts, crafts, literature and humanities also play an important role in the overall progress of a nation. These subjects make people aware of their history and culture. They improve our aesthetic skills and enhance the overall quality of our life. Art subjects provide plenty of job opportunities too. After all, no nation can progress only on the wings of science.
To conclude, government funding should not be limited to science subjects. For the overall development of the country, the government should support the teaching of other subjects as well.

665,The gap between the rich and the poor is growing. What problems does this create? What can be done to tackle them?,"Unequal distribution of wealth is one of the common problems faced by developing nations. This creates a significant gap between the wealthy and the poor and leads to many socio-economic problems. Economic disparity not only affects the lives of the people but also hinders the overall economic development of a nation. The government should always strive towards minimizing this gap. If we look at the problems caused by this phenomenon, we will find a number of issues.
One of the main problems caused by unequal distribution of wealth is that education has become inaccessible to the poor. Nowadays quality education has become very expensive. There are A-list schools and colleges which are very costly and not within the reach of poor people. Due to this, these people are not able to compete for high paying jobs and it becomes a fundamental disadvantage for them. Another important issue is the increase in crime rates. As marginalized groups most often do not make enough money to meet their basic needs, they resort to heinous acts like burglary, theft etc.
Although these issues are critical, it is possible to find solutions. In fact there are various instances where solutions have been provided by the government itself. Firstly, the government should develop schemes and provide scholarships which will help people from the poor section afford quality education. This will give them a fair chance to compete with rich people. Reserving seats for marginalized group or quota system can also be one of the solutions.  In addition, authorities should encourage and endeavor entrepreneurship among underprivileged sects. The government of India, for example, has introduced many schemes to empower the poor. While poverty is still an issue in the country, the life standards of the poor are increasing slowly.
To sum up, the gap between the rich and the poor is widening and has created many problems like an increase in crime rates. However, if the government exercises enough political willpower it is possible to solve these problems.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-the-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-is-widening
666,Intelligence is an important quality in the leader. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people argue that intelligence is a vital quality that a leader must possess. I definitely agree with the aforementioned statement because intelligence allows leaders to think rationally and also helps them to gain public acceptance.
To begin with, leaders need intelligence to think critically and rationally. It is not possible to make the right decision at the right time without intelligence. Decisions which are made by leaders could have a significant impact on our lives and so it is important for leaders to be smart enough to understand consequences of their actions. An intelligent leader can make wise decisions that will make a positive difference to the lives of their followers. For example, it was the intelligence and smartness of Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt that ended the World War Two. As a result, millions of lives were saved.
There is yet another advantage to being an intelligent leader. The public always have a positive opinion of intelligent leaders. They think that such leaders are trustworthy and mature enough to lead them. By contrast, leaders who are not perceived as intelligent have less popularity. For instance, when the forty fifth president of the United States of America took office, people began questioning his eligibility because they thought he was not intelligent enough to lead them. Since people doubted his intelligence, his level of popularity also dipped. Generally speaking, the public only trusts leaders who are intelligent.
To sum up, I strongly agree with the notion that intelligence is necessary in leaders because it helps in critical thinking and improves the public perception of leaders.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-leaders-should-be-intelligent
667,"Most countries allow 18 year olds to start driving a car.  Some say it is good to allow at this age. But, while others think that the age to start driving should be at least 25.  Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","People have different opinions about what the appropriate driving age should be. Some believe that minimum legal driving age should be fixed at 18 years, but others advocate that it should be increased to 25. In my opinion, increasing the driving age is beneficial due to a number of reasons.
Those who are in favor of making 18 year olds eligible for driving argue that this is the age when youngsters are given legal rights to cast a vote and get married. Therefore, giving them driving license at this age will allow them to travel freely. Moreover, adolescence is considered as the best time to learn new skills. So, they can acquire excellent driving skills if they are provided with an opportunity to drive vehicles.
However, many people like me believe that increasing the minimum age for driving to 25 has its own merits. Firstly, mature persons are able to take better decisions in emergency situations such as flat tire while driving. Youngsters, on the other hand, may panic when they are in an emergency and may even cause an accident. Statistics have revealed that people aged between 18 and 20 are involved in 50% of road accidents. Finally, juveniles get fascinated by the speed. Therefore, they will try to ride their vehicles at high speeds posing serious threat to themselves and others. On the other hand, being aware of the consequences, mature people will always drive within permissible speed limit and encourage safe driving.
In conclusion, there may be a few advantages to allowing 18 year olds to drive; however, in my opinion, 25 is the ideal age to start driving because at this age one can make accurate driving decisions and promote safe driving.",8,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-driving-age-should-be-increased-to-25

Some believe that community service should be done for free and should be incorporated into high school syllabus. I totally agree with this view. I also believe that young people should be taught to help others right from their childhood.
In most of the countries across the world, working for a charity begins at schools. For instance, in India many schools follow a curriculum that requires students to spend one day a month at an old age home. They take care of the older people by helping them with various day to day activities. Similarly some of the students also participate in cleaning the neighborhood. For instance, Schwach Bharat initiative also known as clean India programme, attracted many students all over the country. Students started repainting the flyovers and cleaning bridges. These initiatives create a sense of responsibility in children. Many older children also help their juniors in learning and developing various skills. For example, a group of students once came to my neighborhood and taught the younger kids various sports.
There are several benefits to involving children in community service. To start with, they become more responsible and learn to give something back to the society. Also when children work with the underprivileged they will learn to appreciate the good things in their life.
In conclusion, it is very important to serve the society and doing it for free is the basic courtesy one should have. Acts of help, kindness and compassion should be learnt from childhood. A helping hand is always better than a praying heart.

672,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students. Note that all band score estimates are approximate.,"According to some people, schools also have a responsibility to teach good values and behaviour to children. I completely agree with this. Children spend a great deal of their time at school. It is, therefore, the duty of teachers to inculcate good habits and behaviour in them.
Most children now start going to school as soon as they turn three. The school is like a second home to them and there they get to spend time with lots of others. At this age, children have an impressionable mind and anything that they see and hear leave an indelible mark of their mind. Needless to say, teachers can use this period to help them distinguish right from wrong. Young children have tremendous respect for their teachers. In fact, they respect their teachers more than they respect their parents. So, naturally, they will show a greater inclination to walk the right path if teachers show them what is right and what is wrong.
Parents are also responsible for teaching good values to their children. However, they cannot monitor every act of their children. When the kids are at school, teachers are their natural guardians and as such it is the duty of the teachers to teach them what is good and what is bad. A child’s character is formed by the time he or she turns 10. Parents and teachers are the major influences on their life during this period. It is therefore imperative that both parents and teachers take the responsibility to teach them good behaviour.
To conclude, children spend a great deal of time under the care and supervision of their teachers and therefore, teachers have a moral duty to guide them to the right path.",8,band-8-essay-sample-schools-should-teach-good-behaviour-to-children
673,Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.,"Many people consider that home schooling is a better option for children nowadays; however, some people think that it is beneficial for kids to learn at an institution along with other students.
In my opinion, it is always better to study in a school, as it gives exposure and opportunities to learn from others. On the other hand, teaching at home could be beneficial for the better upbringing of a child.
Studying at a school gives children various opportunities to learn sports, arts, language and culture. This cannot be achieved at home.  These institutes not only impart knowledge, but also help children in developing social behaviour, which is extremely important for the society. Schools give children an atmosphere of healthy competition and let them identify their own flaws, which make them more responsible. For example, one of my friend’s daughter could not attend elementary school  because of her bad health. This had a negative effect on her social and communication skills.
On the other hand, there are a few advantages to teaching children at home, as the education provided to the children is controlled and can be monitored. It is a known fact that along with all the good habits, children learn a lot of  bad habits from school, while interacting with other students. This can be avoided when children are taught at home.
To conclude, even though teaching at home has its perks, schooling at an institute is always a better option because of the fact that a child requires development in various areas and regular schooling provides that.",8,band-8-essay-sample-about-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-home-schooling-and-regular-schooling
674,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Nowadays, more and more children are becoming obese and this could have detrimental effects on them when they become older. This essay will outline some reasons for this trend and suggest some solutions.
To begin with, obesity amongst children can be attributed to two factors – junk foods and lack of exercise. Children love eating junk foods but unfortunately they are not healthy. The reason for this is that junk foods are full of bad ingredients such as lipids and high amounts of sugar. For example, a 2010 survey in Australia found that 90% of juvenile obesity was a result of eating unhealthy foods from fast food chains. This clearly indicates that junk foods are the main cause of juvenile obesity. Lack of exercise is another reason for their obesity because it leads to the accumulation of harmful substances such as saturated fats in their bodies. So eating unhealthy foods and leading a sedentary life are the core reasons for children  being overweight.
On the bright side, this issue can be tackled in many ways. First of all, governments should regulate the fast food industry by limiting the amounts of harmful ingredients they use in junk foods and also by imposing sweeping taxes on them to discourage them from spreading. Also, governments can encourage businesses to invest in restaurants which serve healthy foods by reducing taxes for them. Here is a case in study. In 2013, the Japanese government imposed skyrocketing taxes on fast food chains and reduced taxes for restaurants which serve healthy foods, and these measures resulted in a significant decrease in childhood obesity in Japan. Furthermore, parents should also try to encourage their children to eat home cooked foods because they are healthier.
To sum up, childhood obesity is increasing alarmingly and this could complicate their lives in the future. This essay outlined some reason for this kind of obesity and offered some solutions.",8,band-8-essay-sample-obesity-is-increasing-among-children
675,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"It is often argued that social networking sites like Facebook influences people as well as societies and local communities in a negative way. This essay disagrees with this statement because Facebook acts as a common platform for individuals from different backgrounds and helps in solving many socio-economical problems.
There are many reasons why social media plays an important role in an individual’s life. Firstly, they bring people from different parts of the world together. This helps in building new relationships and provides an opportunity to learn about diverse cultures. These sites have even helped many people to find their lost families. In addition, those who share common interests can participate in groups and forums. For example, Facebook has several community groups created by people with extra-ordinary skills in art, music, dance or cookery. Those who are interested in these activities can join these groups and learn new skills. In this fast moving world, social networking sites give relaxation to those who do not have time to meet or communicate with anyone outside their community circle.
Another important advantage of social networking sites is that they allow people to voice their views, opinions and also protest against any global issues. There have been instances where cases like violation of human rights, child trafficking, child abduction, and so on were reported to government authorities through such forums. Recently, photos of a missing kid were posted On Facebook by their family members. Due to the large influx of likes and shares, the picture became quite famous and authorities had to take quick measures to resolve the case. As a result, the culprit was captured and penalized under law. Hence, such forums help in awakening the duties and responsibilities of the authorities and compel ordinary citizens to obey the law.
In conclusion, technological advancements in the field of internet have always helped mankind. By proper usage of social networking sites such as Facebook people can unite and work together for a global cause.",8,band-8-sample-social-networking-sites-have-a-negative-effect-on-society
676,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Defending and assuring the safety of its citizens is the prime responsibility of any government. Therefore, many people believe that the state needs to focus more on defence expenditure than on social benefits. In my opinion, although spending on defence is imperative, citizens should not be deprived of the benefits of social schemes which are equally important for the people.
Protecting its people at all times from external aggression is paramount to the sovereignty of any state. In other words, attempts by neighbouring countries or terrorist organisations to attack the security forces or civilians can cause huge loss to public life and damage to property. This can be because of certain unsettled border disputes or political activism against democratic ideologies or any other geopolitical tensions caused by terrorism activities. For instance, the separatist movement backed by Pakistan in the Indian region of Kashmir has caused tremendous irreparable damage to public property and claimed thousands of innocent lives in the last 20 years. As a result, government has to deploy a large number of military personnel in these border areas at the cost of billions of dollars. By contrast, if there was peace on all borders, the government can allocate sufficient funds for social schemes.
However, the government should refrain from going overboard and ensure that excessive defence spending is not at the cost of social spending. That is to say, citizens, especially from the poor and lower-income class depend largely on assistance from the state in areas of healthcare and education. The government needs to subsidise these activities for the upliftment of the weaker sections of the society. This is vital to narrow the inequality gap between the rich and the poor in the society. This is also equally as important as defence budget because ignoring the people from the lowest strata of society can cause imbalance and chaos in the country due to the stark inequality in people’s living standards. For overall development of the nation, it is the administration’s duty to provide the social benefits to the poorest of the poor. For example, the recent PAHAL scheme by the central government in India to distribute free LPG connections to the poorest in villages has yielded favourable results by helping them use clean cooking gas.
In conclusion, I believe that defence spending to thwart the aggression of unfriendly neighbours is as important as providing assistance to poor citizens through various social benefit schemes.",8,band-8-essay-sample-government-should-increase-defence-spending-to-protect-people
677,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Nowadays, people are showing keen interest in knowing their family history. There are various reasons to justify this curiosity. I believe this is a positive trend as it will bring one closer to one’s extended family. Also young people may feel motivated when they learn about the achievements of their ancestors.
To begin with, people feel proud when they come to know about the achievements of their forefathers. Another reason to find out the history of one’s ancestors is to find out the family medical history. This may often prove beneficial. For instance, if a person knows that his or her great grandparents had diabetes, then they can take corrective measures to ensure that the disease is not transferred to them or the future generation.
In my view, this is a positive development. Due to technology, people can now connect with all the extended members of the family. Hence by knowing their roots, families have better opportunity to forge closer relationships. Family history also helps young generations to get inspired. For example, a young child may get inspired to join army after they discover that their great grandfather was a freedom fighter.
To conclude, I believe knowledge of family roots helps individuals to get inspired and more connected as they come to know more about their extended family. I presume in the near future understanding of family history and particularly medical history will help doctors to find cure for diseases more effectively.",8,band-8-essay-sample-more-and-more-people-are-showing-an-interest-in-finding-out-their-family-history
678,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Nowadays, many parents are concerned about their children’s violent behavior because of the increase in the portrayal of violence in various entertainment programs. These violent programs have many harmful effects. This essay will elaborate more on the harmful effects and suggest possible solutions to mitigate these effects.
To begin with, aggressive behavior in children is one of the side effects of watching violent programs. Children often imitate what they see on television. When they are exposed to violence via TV programs, they start believing that aggression is the best solution for every problem, and they start adopting these unwanted behaviors in their daily life. For example, studies have conclusively shown that children who watch a lot of violent content show high levels of aggression.
Another effect of watching violent content is that they become fearless. Movies always have a hero who has the power to do anything. Teenagers often get influenced by reel heroes. They also get into the habit of abusing weak children. Cases of bullying in schools are increasing.
There are possible solutions to handle these effects. Firstly, parental control can play a major role. Parents must become more vigilant and closely monitor the activities of their children. They also need to educate their young ones that violence is not good for the society and take corrective measures when they see such kind of behavior in their children. Parental lock on TV channels can help parents to limit what their children see on television. Another possible solution is by involving children in community services. Social services like helping elderly people help children to become docile and develop empathy for weaker sections of the society.
To conclude, watching violent content leads to dangerous effect on children such as aggression and fearlessness. These behaviors can be tackled with effective coaching and proper vigilance from parents and by involving children in community services.",8,band-8-essay-sample-watching-violent-content-makes-children-aggressive
679,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Some people with excellent academic qualifications and relevant experience in their fields move to other countries with the objective of earning a higher salary and/or having a better quality of life. This can cause a shortage of talented and skilled professionals in their home country leading to slower economic development at times.
Many highly talented professionals look forward to moving to other countries for getting international work exposure and enjoying a better quality of life. This can be due to lack of sufficient opportunities for career growth or not getting decent remuneration for their technical skills in their own country. In other words, these people want to progress quickly in their job, improve their lifestyle and have a proper work-life balance. For instance, many expert doctors and specialist surgeons from India migrate to work at hospitals in western countries like the USA and the UK for higher pay-packages and an opportunity for further research and development in their field. This trend could have been prevented if they had the chance to work in a better environment and earn a competitive salary in India.
One of the major adverse effects caused by this phenomenon of brain drain is that it deprives the local population of good services in the area of science and technology. This is because such an exodus of much of the creamy layer of skilled professionals creates a serious supply gap that affects the availability of skilled professionals in their country. For example, the number of doctors available in India per million people is a dismal 500, whereas, in the USA there are 2300 doctors to cater to a population of a million. Fees for medical treatments have also increased exorbitantly due to the severe shortage of medical staff and caused enormous difficulties to the overall population.
In conclusion, many highly qualified professionals migrate to other countries for better work opportunities and quality of life. However, this trend creates many issues like brain drain and a severe shortage of skilled labour causing difficulties to people in their home country.",8,band-8-essay-sample-talented-professionals-are-migrating-to-developed-nations
680,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Increasing the tax on private vehicles will make them unaffordable and thus reduce the number of vehicles and traffic congestion on the roads. Other measures such as improving the quality of public transport and promoting concepts like car-pooling may also help. This essay discusses viable solutions to ease traffic congestion on the roads.
Imposing a higher tax on car ownership is one of the best ways to reduce traffic congestion. The exorbitant cost of buying and maintaining a private vehicle will encourage many people to start using the public transport instead. For instance, the Singapore government’s decision to impose a 100 percent tax on cars forced many owners to give up their existing cars because of their inability to afford the tax. This has reduced traffic issues to a large extent.
Improving the quality and reliability of public transport is another solution. The local transport authorities responsible for urban areas need to increase the capacity of public transport and reduce the fare to make them more affordable to the middle class. In other words, making railways and metro more convenient by capacity addition, and enabling commuters to travel at very affordable rates can incentivise people to use public modes of transport.
Additionally, individuals should make use of the latest technology by booking their journeys through mobile apps on various car-pooling platforms, which can help to drastically reduce the number of automobiles on the road. For instance, the UBER app is now being used by many office-goers in Mumbai, and it has resulted in a win-win situation for the local road authorities as well as commuters by enabling decongestion at specific bottlenecks. Obviously, such a combination of solutions by the local governments as well as citizens can ensure decongestion in cities to a large extent.
In conclusion, the imposition of higher tax on private vehicles, increasing the capacity of public transport, reducing the fare through subsidy and adopting the concept of car-pooling are the various effective methods that can be used to tackle the menace of traffic congestion in cities.",8,band-8-essay-sample-increasing-tax-on-private-vehicles-will-reduce-traffic-congestion
681,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"An ever increasing number of people now face health issues caused by a sedentary life style and high levels of stress. Some people suggest that traditional medicines can solve many of these health concerns and therefore we should go back to them. I agree with this view. In my opinion, traditional medicine holds the key to cure many diseases that cannot be cured by modern medicine.
Firstly, modern ways of living and working has created an environment of excessive stress and pressure, especially among urbanites. Lack of sufficient physical activities and frequent consumption of processed foods has a very harmful effect on the body. As a result, people become more prone to chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes, which are very difficult to cure, if not diagnosed correctly in the initial stages. For instance, brain and liver cancer are still incurable by allopathic medicine and there is no breakthrough solution in sight yet. Interestingly, the occurrences of these diseases are uncommon among people who follow a healthy lifestyle and consume natural herbs and roots.
It is, therefore, no surprise that some people have started advocating a switch from allopathy to traditional medicines due to their proven history of treating major health problems without many complications. In other words, such herbal treatments do not harm the body by inflicting side-effects on other organs during the course of treatment. This is because ancient medicinal systems such as Ayurveda treat diseases by attacking the root of the problem and heals the body thorough a holistic manner. To illustrate a point, Cuticurin, a substance found in the root of turmeric, plant has been clinically proven to be effective at attacking the specific cancer cells in the body leaving aside the good cells. By contrast, modern techniques like chemotherapy have dangerous side effects.
In conclusion, I believe that the absence of side effects and the ability to treat the body in a holistic manner makes traditional medicines more effective at curing health problems caused by the modern lifestyle.",8,band-8-essay-sample-traditional-medicines-are-better-than-modern-medicines
682,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"It is true that a company’s success relies heavily on the performance of its staff members. There are several measures that can be implemented to increase staff productivity. This essay will discuss these measures in more detail.
To begin with, improving working conditions for the staff is vital for them to be productive because such improvement will allow them to carry out their duties precisely and in a timely efficient manner. For example, almost all CEOs who participated in a survey in the U.S. said that the most important factor for their success was improving working conditions for the employees. Better working conditions will automatically increase the productivity of employees and allow them to achieve their targets.
It is equally important to keep employees happy. They should feel wanted and valued. Companies can increase the productivity of their staff and boost their morale by rewarding and promoting staff members who carry out their duties effectively because this will encourage other staff members to follow in doing their duties in more effective ways. For instance, in 2012, a Sudanese company was transformed from being a failed company into one of the most successful businesses in Sudan by rewarding and promoting their staff. Thus such a policy will undoubtedly help in increasing the productivity of employees in any business outlet and that will consequently help a company to succeed.
To sum up, the performance of employees is the most imperative factor in any business’s success. Companies can increase the productivity of their staff by improving their working conditions and by giving rewards and promotions.",8,band-8-essay-sample-about-ways-to-improve-performance-of-employees
683,Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"In this age of globalization, most schools encourage their students to become proficient in some foreign language because it will open multiple avenues for them in the future. Some educationists believe that children should be initiated to a new language at the primary level rather than at the secondary level. In my opinion, introducing a foreign language early in the curriculum has more merits than some manageable demerits.
To start with, the most compelling reason for commencing language lessons early in schooldays is that the language learning capability is pretty high in children compared to adults .To explain it further, the young brain has an amazing capacity of registering and assimilating new facts and commands. This capability declines rapidly with age. Moreover, the hesitation to speak, which is usually an important barrier in expressing a new language, is usually not seen in young-ones. For instance, data from International language Institute, China, revealed that proficiency in non -native language is achieved almost 5 years earlier when it is introduced in elementary school as against introduction in secondary school.
In addition, language learning requires regular practice and time to develop fluency. Thus, the early start provides users enough time to master the skill and use it aptly for professional growth at the peak of their career. For example, statistics published in 2010 by Goethe-Institute, New Delhi disclosed that the success rate in clearing the German proficiency exam was 20 percent more among the aspirants when they start training in preparatory school itself.
On the flip side, the other lobby advocating teaching new languages at secondary grade level states that introducing new activity increases the burden on young children who need some time to adjust to the new school environment. Hence, they support teaching anything new at a level when they are fully accustomed to their original syllabus, which usually happens by the time they are in higher classes.
To conclude, in my view, learning a foreign language is the need of the hour, which if started early in life is more fruitful in view of the commendable learning capacity of youngsters and extra time required to achieve excellence in it. However, it might put some surplus load on beginners, which is acceptable because of immense future benefits.",8,band-8-essay-sample-about-the-merits-and-demerits-of-learning-a-foreign-language-in-primary-school
684,"People in all modern societies use drugs, but today’s youth are experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.","Drug addiction is an alarming threat to any society in the world. Unfortunately, unlike in the past, more and more teens are now falling prey to drug abuse. According to some social scientists drug abuse is increasing due to peer pressure. This essay will discuss the causes and effects of drug abuse and also suggest some solutions to this vexed problem.
To begin with, it is an undeniable fact that the behaviour of parents has a direct impact on children. It is very natural for children to follow their parents and imitate their habits. For example, a 2014 survey published by Asian Times revealed that 70 percent of children whose parents are chain smokers start using drugs at the age of nine. Thus it is evident that substance abuse among parents is one of the major causes of the same among children and teens. Friends are equally to blame. Humans by nature are influenced by the activities of their friends.
One of the greatest social scientists once said that if you want to know the character of a person, you only have to look around his friend circle. Children who are in bad company will most probably develop the same bad habits. To illustrate, I have seen many of my innocent university friends later abuse themselves with drugs after getting into bad company.
To get around this problem, the government should take some initiatives to educate youngsters about the ill effects of drugs on their body and mind. The government can rope in the media and celebrities to drive home the message. Parents also need to monitor the activities of their children and set an example themselves.
To put it in a nutshell, drug addiction is a serious issue and a threat for any nation. Therefore, the government as well as the society should take some measures to protect its people, especially the young generation, from this menace.",8,band-8-essay-sample-about-increasing-use-of-drugs

To what extent do you agree?,"Although, books were a good source of information and entertainment in the past, some people believe that books are increasingly becoming less important as a source of knowledge and entertainment. I strongly agree with this statement for the following reasons: the invention of the internet and the introduction of different kinds of entertainment.
To begin with, people these days are becoming less dependent on books as a source of information. The invention of the internet has changed the way we gain information and knowledge because of the easy access to such information. In the past books were the only source of information but nowadays the internet has become the main source of such information. For example, a recent survey in the U.S. found that ninety per cent of people totally rely on the internet to gain information. As a result, books are becoming less important as a source of information.
Furthermore, books are also increasingly being deserted as a way of entertainment because there are many kinds of entertainment available these days. People are more interested in other types of entertainment such as playing football and swimming as they all are beneficial to our health. For instance, a study in Australia found that more than eighty five per cent of people prefer other ways of entertainment because of their health benefits. Consequently, books are losing their role as a source of entertainment.
To conclude, I absolutely agree that the importance of books as a source of information and entertainment is fading in today’s world. The invention of the World Wide Web and the introduction of other types of entertainment are the reasons for this argument.",8,band-8-essay-sample-books-are-becoming-less-important-as-a-source-of-information
686,The advantages provided by English as a global language will continue to outweigh the disadvantages.To what extent do you agree.,"As a part of globalisation English has become the most widely spoken language around the world. While there are many benefits to using English as a global language, it also has some negative effects.
To begin with, one of the main advantages of having one global language is that it will reduce the gap between the countries as there is no communication barrier. It helps to form a stronger relationship among the nations. As a result, international trades such as the importing and exporting of goods will increase and benefit the growth of economy around the globe. Furthermore, English helps people to travel around the world without experiencing any difficulties. Many tourists find it hard to communicate to the native people for their simple needs such as asking directions, ordering food etc. These issues will be solved if there is only one language.
On the other hand, there are many drawbacks to this trend. Language is a part of every culture. If everyone spoke one language, the other local languages will disappear gradually. Then, there would be no cultural diversity. One of the main reasons that attract tourists to other countries is that their cultural differences. If everyone has the same culture, there is no meaning in visiting other places. So this trend can have negative impacts on the tourism industry.
To conclude, although there are some negative sides to having a single global language, it brings many benefits such as the growth of international business and economy. In my opinion, the advantages of having one global language far outweigh its disadvantages.",8,band-8-sample-about-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-english-as-a-global-language
687,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.,"In many countries, youngsters are often encouraged to take an year off, to work or travel across the world, before embarking on their formal university education. This recent trend, also known as “gap – year”, has numerous merits and a few demerits, which will be discussed in this essay.
To begin with, the biggest advantage of taking sabbatical to explore the world is that it gives them an opportunity to discover their career interest. Such trips are not only fun , but also  gives  them  a chance  to  socialise , engage in volunteering, and understand global issues  and global culture . This helps them to discover their real passion which is the foundation stone for a fulfilling career. For instance, data from Harvard University, 2010, pointed out that drop-out rate from university courses is around 10 percent less in those children who chose the course after taking a “gap year” in comparison to those who headed straight to university after the high school.
In addition to this, working for a year before starting university reduces the financial burden of higher education to an extent. As the advanced studies are costly in most countries, working for a year helps them in saving money so they have to borrow less money and are under less financial debt, when they start higher studies.
In contrast to above viewpoints, the most significant disadvantage of such a break is that it can be a distraction from further studies. Some students find such breaks so relaxing and enjoyable that they decide to shun further studies permanently.
Although the incidences of such cases are few, the effects can be disastrous for their further career. For instance, a 2010 report from Florida University revealed that 1 in 100 students, who take “Gap-year” never go for advanced studies and struggle throughout their life to make the ends meet because of being unskilled.
To conclude, the break of a year taken before pursuing university studies helps students to discover their career interest and also allows them to consolidate financially. However, for a minority of high school graduates it can lead to an end of  an academic career .",8,advantages-and-disadvantages-of-taking-a-gap-year-band-8-essay-sample
688,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"As the technology has advanced, an increasing number of people are now able to work from home using their computers rather than going to workplace every day. In my opinion this trend should be promoted as it brings many benefits for workers as well as employers.
To begin with, nowadays working with the computers from home has brought several advantages to people. Firstly, the atmosphere at home helps to reduce stress as people can work at their own pace without facing any distraction from other colleagues. Therefore they can complete their tasks with more perfection. Secondly, when people work from home, they can save money on travel costs. They also get to take care of their home and children. This is particularly helpful for women with young children. Since it eliminates the need to go out to work, they can take care of their children and at the same time build their career.
Apart from the workers, the employers benefit from this approach. The main advantage is that chances of conflict among employees reduce when they work from home and productivity increases. Moreover, employers do not have to worry about organizing vacations for their staff. They do not have to invest in expensive hardware either. When employees work from their home, they will most probably be using their computers, printers, telephones and other equipment to get their work done. Employers can also save money on utility bills and rentals.
To conclude, it is true that nowadays a growing number of people are working from home instead of going to office. In my opinion, this arrangement should be supported as it benefits both the employees and the employers.",8,band-8-essay-sample-about-the-advantages-of-working-from-home
689,"Millions of people every year move to English-speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university.","During the last few decades, the number of people moving to English-speaking countries has risen dramatically. This trend is a result of the desire to learn English and live in developed countries like Australia, Britain or America.
English is the first language in most of the developed countries of the world and learning English is a prerequisite to migrating to these countries. These countries are also the center of top ranking universities which offer education in English. Students of various nationalities are keen to study in these developed countries because they offer high quality education, advanced living standards and an opportunity to mingle with people belonging to different cultures and nationalities. Truly, studying at an internationally acclaimed university is an opportunity that broadens one’s horizons and perspectives.
The popularity of English is another factor that encourages students to choose English speaking countries for their higher education. English is easy to learn and is taught at schools in many developing nations. Most academic books and journals are published in English or an English version is readily available. It is observed that in a multinational gathering, people tend to communicate in English, because it is the universal link language. Most educational and knowledge imparting websites are also in English. Also, the computer programs are written in English language. Thus, it is evident that English has become an important language for anyone to learn and achieve their career goals.

690,"Each year, the crime rate increases.
What are the causes of crime and what could be done to prevent this rise in criminal activity?","Statistical studies over the last decade have shown an invariable increase in crime rates due to various reasons. This essay will dive into the causes of crime and suggest remedies to mitigate the rise in criminal activities.
Rapid urbanization has caused the migration of the rural population to urban areas in search of greener pastures all over the world. This increase in competition for housing, employment and other necessities has led to a precarious situation in larger cities. Rising unemployment and discontent amongst the people due to socio-economic reasons manifest in different ways.
Crimes committed by the youth can be attributed to illiteracy, peer pressure or circumstances. Rising cost of living and disparity between the rich and the poor are also leading causes of crime in cities. Sometimes, the media also glorifies crime. Teenagers who watch such programmes often arrive at the conclusion that it is ‘cool’ to get involved in anti-social or criminal activities.
Even in such a grim situation, there are plenty of actions that can be taken to curtail rising crime rates. The governing bodies must help create employment opportunities for youth in rural areas and help them develop the economy. Entrepreneurs in cities should be entrusted with the task of creating job opportunities for the youth. Primary education should be made compulsory across the nation so as to discourage the young from diverting towards crimes. To contain anti-social situations, the government should award stringent punishments to criminals. In addition providing subsidies to people living under poverty levels would help provide sustenance.

691,The best way to learn English is to study in an English speaking country. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is definitely true that studying English in an English-speaking country is the best way to learn English. These days, increasing numbers of foreign students are heading to English-speaking countries to learn the de facto universal language, English. Therefore, I agree with the given statement for two reasons: good opportunities to practice the language and access to native English-speaking teachers.
To begin with, when students live in an English speaking country, there are more opportunities for students to use English language in their daily lives. The reason for this is that they have no other language to communicate with local people. For example, in Britain, there is no other way but to communicate in English. As a result, students learn the language in order to understand other people and consequently improve their English in a very short amount of time.
Furthermore, students will be able to study English with the aid of native English speaking teachers, who are experts in the language and know the best way to teach English language to foreigners. Because of this students will learn the right pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. For instance, British, Australian, Canadian, and American teachers have very clear pronunciation, which is very important in learning the language. As a result, students will learn the basics of the language in the most accurate and effective way and quickly improve their English thereafter.
To sum up, I strongly agree with the statement that the easiest and most effective way to learn English language is to go to an English speaking country. The opportunity to use the language in daily life and the accurate way of learning the basics such as pronunciation and grammar are the reasons for the aforementioned narrative.",8,band-8-essay-sample-the-best-way-to-learn-english-is-to-live-in-an-english-speaking-country
692,"In some countries the average weight of people is increasing and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing.
What do you think are the causes of these problems and what measures could be taken to solve them?","It is a fact that in some countries, the average weight of the citizens is shooting up while their fitness and health conditions are worsening. In my view this is mainly because of the food habits and modern lifestyle they follow. In this essay, I will examine these two factors and then propose a viable solution.
One of the foremost reasons for obesity is the consumption of unhealthy foods. Many people started to follow western food habits and eventually ended up eating high fat content foods like pizza and burger. Regular consumption of these fat rich foods will increase a person’s weight in a short span of time.
In addition to that, now-a-days, more and more people are living a sedentary lifestyle. They do not dedicate any time to do any kind of physical activity. As a result, they lose their resistance power. If this lifestyle continues then people will fall ill more frequently and lose their health permanently.
It is necessary that the government takes steps to open many sports complexes and fitness studios near residential communities. Most of the people who do not want to travel far to go to a sports center will be ready to use one if it is available nearby. In a study conducted by a popular newspaper 90% of the respondents said that they are willing to use the gym or any physical activity centers if they are within 3 kilometer radius.
To conclude, encouraging people to do more physical activities will not only improve their fitness and overall health but also help people to shed their weight.",8,band-8-sample-causes-of-obesity
693,"The use of mobile phones in public places is as antisocial a smoking. Smoking is banned in certain places, so mobile phones should be banned in the same way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Mobile phones have become an integral part of our lives but they become a nuisance when they are used in public places. Just like smoking is banned in public places, some people feel that mobile phones too should be banned. I agree with this view and I personally believe that this move will make our public places a lot more peaceful.
There are several detriments to mobile phone usage at public places. Firstly, mobile phones radiations can cause damage to the brain and the heart of the user. Secondly, the ringtones and the speaking on the phone make disturbances in public transport, parks and cinemas. Finally, mobile phone thefts have become a growing crime in crowded places. It is evident that because of the public use of mobile phones, many people lose their expensive handsets and also become mentally disturbed.
There are many more reasons to restrict the use of mobile phones in public places. In places like hospitals, libraries and devotional centres mobile phones cause a great deal of distraction.  In schools and universities, students can send messages, videos and music on cellular phones while the teacher teaches the lessons in the classrooms. There is yet another argument for banning mobile phones from public places. Some perverts take obscene pictures or videos from beaches, playgrounds or swimming pools on their mobile phones.
In conclusion, mobile phones are certainly a great innovation, but they are also a distraction and a nuisance and therefore, in my opinion, they should be banned from public places.

694,"Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals: during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Some people feel that religious festivals are becoming meaningless with most people only wanting to enjoy themselves. I don’t agree with this view. In my opinion, festivals are to be enjoyed. Also I don’t think that people have forgotten their meaning.
All traditional festivals teach and celebrate the good values of life such as morality and ethics. In my country, for example, people celebrate Diwali in a grand manner by wearing new clothes, giving and receiving presents, bursting crackers and preparing traditional foods which give them more enjoyment. In addition, by decorating their homes with earthen lamps they are also sending out the message that we should dispel darkness from the world and our lives. Similar behaviour can be seen during the non-religious festivals like Bogi. People come together making bonfires, watching fireworks displays, and participating in the cultural events held in local parks.
In my opinion, the argument that people have forgotten the meaning of festivals is meaningless. In schools, children are learning the reasons for celebrating festivals such as Diwali, Navratri, Pongal, Easter, Id and Holi in their text books. Also, devotional singing and writing competitions are held to encourage the students to learn more about the religious festivals. In addition, parents tell children interesting anecdotes about various festivals to ensure that they stay rooted in their culture.
In conclusion, even in this fast paced modern world, people are still celebrating their religious festivals with full of enthusiasm and joyfulness. Just because they are celebrating it does not mean that they have forgotten the values and messages of these festivals.",8,band-8-essay-sample-people-have-forgotten-the-meaning-of-festivals
695,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"A few centuries ago travelling was only for the rich, but it has now become very common amongst all the people. This is attributable to the advancement in technology. Today we have aeroplanes and they have reduced travel times significantly.
Various modes of travel are available these days, which give people the freedom to choose based on their budget and time. Earlier, there were very few options available. People had to either spend a lot of money to get on a aeroplane or spend a lot of time to get to their destination via sea or by train. These days, travellers have plenty of flights to choose from. Aeroplane tickets are more affordable since the frequency of flights have increased considerably.
This shift has brought about a lot of benefits for the travellers.  They can easily visit several locations, travelling long distances in a couple of hours. It allows travellers to explore different cultures, appreciate their values, and enjoy their food. For example, when tourists visit undeveloped countries, they see a lot of people who don’t have the basic necessities of life. It makes them value what they have in life and fills their heart with gratitude. Travellers learn to value and respect the diversity and differences.
Moreover, travelling works as a stress buster for the travellers. It gives them a nice break from their work or studies, takes their mind off worldly worries, and allows them to enjoy the life beyond boundaries. When they return from their travel, they are more focused and productive in their work.
To sum it up, travel is no longer limited to the wealthy.  Many people have in fact taken up travelling as a full-time job to make a living. It has helped tourists to understand different cultures and appreciate the differences.",8,band-8-essay-sample-more-people-are-travelling-than-ever-before
696,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"School education plays a crucial role in shaping us as individuals. Many people believe that free social work should be mandatory for high school students. In my opinion, including this as a part of the school curriculum would certainly be a step in the right direction.
Students pick up good values and habits during their school years. When they grow up, these values go a long way in moulding them into responsible adults. If social work is made mandatory just like other subjects and activities in school, they will learn the importance of living together and giving back to the society.  It teaches them to share what they have with others, for the greater good. They learn to be more tolerant.
When students step outside of their schools and colleges, they get busy in building a career and making a living. They weigh everything with money. If there is a previous exposure to social community work in their early years of education, chances are they will be more grounded and not be tied down by the materialistic worldly things.
Furthermore, people who learn these values in their childhood are inclined to do a lot of charitable work when they grow up to be successful professionals. For example, one of my friends, who happens to be a lawyer, does a lot of pro bono cases to help people who don’t have the money to pay for her services. As a child, she grew up in a house where everyone dedicated one day of their work week to voluntary public service.
To sum it up, unpaid community service will not only benefits students on an individual level but also help solve many problems in the society.",8,band-8-essay-sample-unpaid-community-service-should-be-part-of-high-school-curriculum
697,General Training task 2,"English has become the default global language. Someone who speaks English can travel all over the world without experiencing any difficulties. English is also the language of business and science. Therefore, I agree with the argument that the merits contributed by English as a world language will continue to outweigh the drawbacks.
There are compelling reasons to learn English. The primary benefit is that English has been widely used for communication purpose ever since the days of imperialism. For instance, a tourist usually uses English for a plethora of purposes such as asking for directions, buying food and so on. In addition, English is the preferred language for conflict resolution around the world. Moreover, scientific education is mainly imparted in English. For example, almost all journal articles and conference papers are in English. Therefore, these merits vindicate the importance of the English language.
However, there are some disadvantages to using English as a world language. First of all, it is not easy for non-native English learners to become fluent in reading, writing or speaking English. Furthermore, people in some countries find learning English to be extremely difficult because of burgeoned differences in written expression. For example, each symbol is a word in the Chinese language, hence learning English may be an arduous task for the Chinese people. Consequently, people from non-English speaking nations have to learn English as a second language in addition to their native language. But none of these are valid excuses for not learning English because someone who speaks English has a clear advantage over someone who doesn’t speak English.
Having considered a range of arguments, I have drawn the conclusion that the merits provided by English as a global language outweigh the drawbacks. English is widely used for communication among people and even for conflict resolution. Scientific study is also conducted using the English language.",8,band-8-essay-sample-advantages-of-english-as-a-global-language
698,In this age of globalisation how can companies keep their employees motivated and satisfied. State your view with examples.,"In today’s global landscape, where employees are faced with local as well as international opportunities, companies are investing more than ever in controlling their attrition rates. It has become extremely crucial for the human resource department to retain workforce and keep them continuously engaged and happy.
One of the challenges in doing so is to keep employees constantly motivated. Motivated employees are more efficient and productive; they take ownership of work and generally outperform resulting in a sense of satisfaction. Many people argue that if employees are compensated well, they will always be motivated whereas, others think that it is not just about money. To exemplify, Daniel Pink, who is a renowned psychologist, has done various studies and researches on this matter and found that it is when people are given a sense of purpose at work, that they feel motivated to accomplish their tasks. Through his studies, he discovered that even though money is imperative for stability, it doesn’t keep employees motivated for too long. Hence, companies should constantly try to challenge their employees with good work, give them ownership and responsibility and ensure that they understand the overall goals of the organisation and their role in helping achieve them.
There is also the social factor which plays an important role in engaging employees. After all, humans are social animals. Companies should organise weekly fun activities or occasional team building trips. For instance, many companies have introduced the concept of fun Fridays where people can socialise, watch a movie together, have drinks and make a conversation with people outside of their work teams. Companies also benefit from such activities as it encourages team bonding. In addition, it has also been observed that companies which invest in coaching and training their employees are likely to have a much satisfied workforce.
To conclude, retaining workforce requires a multipronged approach. In my opinion, companies should focus on creating a friendly workplace and giving their employees a sense of purpose. Organizations that are invested in their people’s growth will have no difficulty retaining them.",8,band-8-essay-sample-how-can-companies-retain-their-workforce
699,The following is an essay submitted by one of our readers.,"People have different views about the purpose of museums in modern society. While it’s true that museum – as tourist attractions – should be fascinating, I stand by the idea that the main role of the museum is to give knowledge of cultural, religious and historical importance.
On the one hand, it can be argued that museums should be entertaining and more attractive to the public. Museums are widely considered as important tourist attractions of any cities or countries. However, there’s a common belief that they are too elitist, uninspiring and only encourage educated people to visit. By adding more entertainment values, museums can appeal to a broader audience. Nowadays there is also a wide range of museums which do not have academic purpose; but more light-hearted and humorous theme; for example; chocolate museum in Belgium, kimchi museum in South Korea, museum of Broken Relationships in Croatia or cheese museum in The Netherlands.
On the other hand, I strongly believe that the main purpose of museums is to educate people as they exhibit collections of interesting objects that hold great cultural or historical values. The aim of any exhibitions is to teach visitors things that they didn’t know before. To achieve that, museums usually offer free guided tours with professional guides or give away brochures, guidebooks, audio tapes that contain detailed information about the exhibitions. By doing that, museums should play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science and many other aspects of life.
In conclusion, I think museums, as educational institutions, should offer educative, interesting and enjoyable experiences to visitors.

700,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"It is true that imported food items need to travel long distances before they reach the supermarket. There could be several reasons for this trend, and I would argue that it has both advantages and disadvantages.
One of the obvious reasons for importing food is globalisation. Today’s global trade with low transportation cost and fewer trade barriers has encouraged the transport of food from one country to another. Another reason could be overpopulation. Some countries, in particular developing countries, generally have significant growth in population. Due to this it is not always possible to fulfill the needs of their citizens with domestically produced food and therefore they have to depend on imported food. Finally some countries do not have sufficient resources or geographical conditions to produce certain crops in their own farms. In such circumstances, it is a good idea to get those foods items imported.
Food miles can have an impact on people’s life. On the one hand, it can be a cause of global warming. Food transport burns out a lot of fossil fuels and generates co2 emissions which lead to global warming. Another drawback is local farmers will lose job as they will not be able to compete with international market and this will adversely affect economy of the nation.
On the other hand, imported food are cheaper that local products. Moreover, people will have a wide range of choice in super market and also most food items will be available to them throughout the year. Furthermore, we can use more land to build more houses.   As population grows, we need more houses and other facilities such as schools, wider roads and so on. If we do not have to produce our own food, this land can be used for constructing more houses.
In conclusion, while people depend on imported food items for various reasons, in my opinion, this trend has both positive and negative aspects.",8,band-8-essay-sample-food-travels-long-distances-to-reach-consumers
701,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"With the dramatic increase in population globally, a challenge faced by many big cities is insufficient land space. Governments have been providing incentives for people to relocate to regional areas. However, none of these seem to solve the issue of congestion. The problem lies in employment, as people prefer to live close to work. By encouraging industries and businesses to move to regional areas, lots of benefits will be achieved.
Industries and businesses are the main drivers of economy. With their existence in regional areas, people will be attracted to move out of big cities. These people get better chances to secure jobs in a less competitive environment. As more people in rural areas get employed, their spending power increases. A chain effect then takes place, attracting more businesses to meet the demand in these areas. Apart from that, with industries and businesses moving out of cities, the cities become more liveable. The decrease in congestion, vehicular traffic, pollution, and competition allows city folks to live a less stressful lifestyle.
On the flip side, industries and businesses may face some challenges during early stages of transition. Moving to an area with low demand will not be profitable for them. However, there is a way around this. Businesses can still have offices in cities to develop business, while relocating their plants and manufacturing facilities to regional areas. What is more, building or renting facilities in regional areas are much cheaper.
All in all, the advantages of relocating industries and businesses to regional areas clearly outweigh any drawbacks. As long as businesses are willing to adapt, communities in big cities and regional areas will benefit from this change as well.",8,band-8-essay-sample-2
702,"The internet has brought about many changes into our day to day life. Nowadays we are doing things such as mailing, contacting, banking and communication much faster. Do these developments have more advantages than disadvantages?","The internet has transformed people’s lives. It has changed the way we communicate with each other, transact business and access information. Although the internet has both positive and negative aspects, I believe that its merits outweigh its demerits.
To begin with, thanks to the internet, people can now contact their friends, family and colleagues faster and more efficiently than in the past. Most people have internet connection on their mobile or computer and as a result, they can always stay connected with their near and dear ones. For example, social networking applications like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter allow people to chat and share videos and other important information. Similarly, through facilities like video conferencing and webinars people from different parts of the world can now participate in online conferences which eliminate the need to travel to other countries and cities for attending such programmes.
Additionally, online shopping and banking have saved people a great deal of time and effort. People today can sit at home and buy their grocery, books or household appliances from online sites such as Amazon or eBay and their stuff will be delivered at home. Moreover, transferring and withdrawing money have become very easy today with online facilities offered by most banks.
On the other hand, a great deal of offensive and obscene content is available on the web and children have easy access to them. Many antisocial elements and terrorist groups like ISIS recruit youngsters through the internet. Internet addiction is another problem. Many people are now addicted to the internet and wasting their time. This can affect their career and relationships.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Throughout the history, there has always been a gender gap. Only in recent years have we started ‘breaking the walls’ between the genders. Even so, it is still a hot topic whether there should be mixed-gender schools or not.
From my perspective, boys and girls have much to learn from each other. Therefore, they should study together. In this essay, I am going to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of mixed-gender and single-gender schools.
To begin with, we live in a world full of different nationalities, races, genders, and cultures. It is important for an individual to treat everyone around them with respect. That is why we need mixed-sex education. It will help children to understand each other’s uniqueness and provide them with the opportunity to acquire interpersonal skills.
On the flip side, single-sex schools focus on gender-specific activities like knitting or cooking for girls and mechanics, electronics or carpentry for boys. Consequently, graduates from this type of institutions will have greater skills and knowledge in those activities. That, potentially, can provide them with benefits in their careers. For instance, a girl who learned cooking or designing at school can easily become a professional cook or a designer when she grows up.
To recapitulate, both types of educational systems have their advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, mixed-gender institutions tend to prepare their graduates to the real world situations better than single-gender schools. It is essential to remember that every successful person should know how to interact/communicate with different categories of people. This skill can only be obtained from a diverse environment such as mixed-sex schools.",8,band-8-essay-sample-boys-and-girls-should-be-taught-in-separate-schools

Some people believe that figuring out a way to adapt to the changing climate rather than preventing it from happening is the best solution to this problem. In my opinion, I agree with this statement to some extents. I think people should try to mitigate the negative effects caused by climate change so that they can live with it. Meanwhile, they should also take some measures to prevent it from getting worse.
It is undeniable that it is necessary for people to find a way to live with the changing climate because it has already happened. We cannot actually prevent something that has already happened. All people must face the truth that the changing climate has brought us a variety of negative impacts. For example, the temperature is increasing and the sea level is rising. Finding a way to mitigate the demerits of these phenomena is, therefore, critical to human beings. Only in this way, the development of human society will not be inhibited by the effects of climate change.
While it is impossible for us to prevent the climate change that has already happened, it does not mean that we can allow the situation to get worse. People still need to find out the reason of climate change and try to come up with a practical solution to prevent it from getting worse. If we only focus on how to adapt the changes but ignore the problem itself, the change of climate will become more significant. The more significant has the climate changed, the more difficult it is for us to deal with it. We have to adopt some measures to prevent it from being unmitigable. Otherwise, the world may suffer from a catastrophic consequence.
To conclude, we have to admit the fact that the climate change has already happened therefore we must find a way to adapt these changes. However, a series of prevention measures still need to be figured out to avoid the predictable worse situation in the future.",8,band-7-5-essay-sample-we-should-learn-to-live-with-climate-change
705,Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education. Or is it the responsibility of the governments of the poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?,"Our world is mainly divided into two types of countries – developed and developing (underdeveloped). I opine that while governments of developing countries are responsible for their citizens, developed countries too can contribute their bit.
To begin with, the world should be considered as a family. Because all the countries share the same natural resources, problems created by one nation can affect another. For example, if the developing countries add serious level of pollution to the environment, the resultant global warming will affect developed countries as well. Hence, if developed nations share technical know-how and other useful information with developing nations, some global issues can be effectively tackled.
Furthermore, people who are starving for basic necessities can threaten the peace of the world. We cannot deny the fact that humans have some basic necessities such as food and shelter and non-availability of these can lead them to invade the places which are rich and prosperous. This situation can even culminate in wars. For example, people from some developing countries always try to enter developed nations in search of a better future. This creates conflicts between them. We have recently seen problems of refugee camps near France border which is created by the people affected by Syrian crises. Therefore, if the developed world takes care of underdeveloped nations, peace can be established.
Moreover, the value of aid that poor nations receive is much higher than its cost for rich nations. Developed world uses their wealth in luxury and non-basic amenities which are not necessities. Alternatively, if the same wealth is expended for providing food and education in developing nations, it will be worthier. For example, countries like USA can cut some spending on entertainment and deploy it for providing food and education in some countries in Africa.
In conclusion, wealthy nations should consider themselves as care takers and provide maximum support for basic necessities such as food and education in developing countries.",8,band-8-essay-should-wealthy-nations-help-poor-nations

Do you agree or disagree?","Young people are living under an increasing stress in recent years. Some people claim that the major source of this pressure is sports competitions. They believe adolescents should be prevented from participating in those events. However, I oppose this statement. In my opinion, banning youths from sports events is not the right solution for this issue.
Preventing teenagers from taking part in sports competitions is not only an impractical but also a detrimental measure. Sports competition is believed to be an effective way to inspire young people’s interest on sports. Banning youths from participating sports competitions may result in the lack of attractiveness on sports for young people. Many of youths, therefore, may not be able to realise the importance of doing sports. Consequently, an increasing number of young people might suffer from a variety of health problems due to the lack of exercise. Additionally, we are living in an age of cut-throat competitions. Preventing young people from learning to handle the stress brought by sports competitions may lead them to be vulnerable to tougher competitions in their future career life.
Furthermore, participating sports competitions is not the major source of youth’s stress, instead, it is a effective method of releasing stress. In contemporary society, most of young people are stressed out because their study or work. Doing sports with others is the easiest way to release their pressure after working or school hours. During sports competitions, they can cultivate their sense of teamwork and collaboration. They can also improve their communication skills and make friends with others. It must be admitted participating competitions will inevitably result in some extra stress on the participants. Nonetheless, this can be regarded as a good practice for young people to improve their mental fitness.

707,Some people think that only staff who worked in a company for a long time should be promoted to higher positions. Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and examples.,"Employers often believe that employees who have spent a lot of years in an organization are more likely to be loyal to it. They tend to reward this loyalty with promotions and rises. I am not against promoting senior employees. However, in my opinion, new hires too should be promoted if they have the skills and qualifications.
Just because someone has spent ten or twenty years in an organization, it does not mean that they are the most competent. Sometimes new employees deliver better performance than senior employees because they possess more skills and qualifications. What’s more, a ‘new employee’ may have years of experience in another organization.
If competent employees are denied promotion because they don’t have years of experience in the organization, it will affect their morale. Worse, it may encourage them to quit and join another company that honours talent. Attrition will only hurt the interests of an organization.
To conclude, in my opinion, employers should consider a variety of factors while determining an employee’s eligibility for promotion. This includes their qualifications, special skills and domain expertise. Promotions and rises encourage employees to work harder.

Others claim that it is better to start work after school and gain experience in the world of work. How far do you agree or disagree with the above views?,"In some people’s opinion, obtaining a university degree is the only way to find a good job. Others, however, believe that start work earlier instead of completing the university education is better for one’s career life. I agree with the previous view to some extent, while as far as I am concerned, getting a university degree should not be considered as the only way to a good job.
It is evident that having a university degree is the best way to find a satisfactory job. In the university, people are supposed to work hard on their specific areas for their degree. Therefore, they are likely to have a better understanding of the knowledge in their area than those who do not receive any university education. These academic skills will become a firm basis for their working skills. Furthermore, getting a university degree is usually regarded as a symbol of intelligence and diligence. For employers, a certificated university degree is a convincing proof of the competence of the employee. As a result, many top-level corporations prefer to provide more job opportunities for people with a university background rather than the others.
On the flip side, completing a course of university education is not the only way to guarantee a good job. There are some examples of people without a university degree making a great achievement in their working life. Likewise, not all university graduates are able to get themselves a satisfying job. It is undeniable that people who start career life earlier can gain more working experience than university students. However, the absence of advanced education may result in the lack of academic knowledge basis in their working areas, which may inhibit the development of their career life. Research points out that the percentage of university graduates getting a good job is much larger than people without a university degree.
To conclude, in most cases, completing the university education and getting a degree is the easiest but not the only way to a good job.

Some people claim that the reason to learn a foreign language is to travel or work in overseas countries. Conversely, others believe that these are not the only reasons why people should learn a foreign language; I agree with this statement.
It is true that people are keen to learn a foreign language in order to travel or work in a foreign country. To be clear, in the last few years, globalization left a huge impact on the economy of all nations and promoted the growth of multinational companies. Therefore, the rise in the number of people working overseas resulted in an increase in the demand for learning a foreign language. In addition, people need to learn foreign language if they want to travel to overseas countries. For example, if people want to visit a foreign country, they have to learn basic conversations in the local language to communicate with native speakers in daily life.
Nonetheless, traveling or working is not the only reasons why some people learn foreign languages. People need a foreign language for their studies. Many academic programs make learning a foreign language compulsory. When students learn a foreign language, they can understand and appreciate diverse cultures. People learn new languages for job purposes as well. For instance, many professional jobs in the UK and Australia require IELTS or TOEIC certification. Some learn languages because they love it.
In conclusion, the number of people learning a foreign language has increased dramatically. There are several reasons for this.

The fact that parents are the original mentors of children is clear. As a result they can have enormous influence on their children’s behavior. What’s more, family is the fundamental unit of the society. Recent studies have convincingly shown that children learn family values unconsciously. So, if parents behave well, children will also behave well. The opposite is also true. Most parents already recognize this. They understand that they have an important role in bringing up good citizens.
Teachers also have an important role in shaping up the character and personality of a child. I don’t agree with the argument that school is the only place to learn character and values. Home is equally important. It is the first place where a child gets to interact with other members of the society.
Because of this reason, the lessons and the skills that a child learn from school during the formative years of her life will have profound impact on her personality and character. When children interact with other children, they learn the importance of cooperation and compromise. They learn to adjust. They learn to accept success and defeat. In fact, learning social skills and values in the company of others of the same age is easier.
To conclude, children have a lot to learn from home and school and both parents and teachers are crucial to their all round development. In my opinion, both parents and teachers have equal responsibilities for shaping the character of children.",8,band-8-essay-sample-school-is-the-place-to-learn-social-values
711,Some students work while studying. This often results in lacking time for education and constantly feeling under pressure. What do you think are the causes of this?,"Education, especially long term courses or studies at prestigious universities can be very costly. To still be able to study, a lot of young adults decide to find a part time job. But often their studies and quality of life suffer from the additional responsibility. Symptoms linked to stress and work overload are known medical problems amongst students.
Multiple reasons might oblige a student to work while studying. First of all, it is the simple lack of financial support from his family. It is true that really poor families will be supported by the government to be able to send their kids to university. But this is often not the case with middle class families. Yet, middle class families do not necessarily have a lot of money to finance long studies. Another reason can be the choice of place. Some universities are better than others, but might be in a more expensive city or have higher fees. Some courses are indeed very long and it can be difficult for a family to finance long studies especially when they have more than one child. Finally, finding a part time job can also be the personal choice of a young adult seeking financial independence.
As can be seen, the motivations are various. But there are solutions to help students manage the combined burden of studies and financial commitments. Scholarships are one of them. Another solution can be to offer students job possibilities in a field linked to their studies. This will not only make them earn money but also give them experiences useful for their studies and exams. In a way, a student can work and learn at the same time.
So it seems to me that the reasons to take a part time job are diverse, inevitable and often fully understandable. I think solutions – such as scholarships and intelligent and qualifying job possibilities – should be implemented by universities in order to help the students and to increase the quality of education.",8,band-8-essay-sample-part-time-jobs-make-students-stressed-out
712,The threat of nuclear weapons maintains world peace. Nuclear power provides cheap and clean energy. The benefits of nuclear technology far outweigh the disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There are many benefits to nuclear energy.  Military powers have used them to end wars and are still using them as a deterrent. Used for civilian reasons, nuclear energy provides electricity with no negative impact on the environment. Some people, therefore, believe that the advantages of nuclear power outweigh the disadvantages. However, in my opinion, these are all misconceptions and I don’t support nuclear power.
Used as a weapon it has the most destructive power. The effects of radiation have consequences for years to come. The genetic material of human beings and of plants could be damaged from exposure to radiation. Restoring peace and rebuilding the country after a nuclear attack can be even more difficult. The radiation can even affect people living in neighbouring countries.  Today, nuclear weapons could fall in the hands of the so called rogue states or terrorist groups. If used for terrorist purposes the consequences could be quite disastrous.
As a source of energy for civilian reasons nuclear power seems very attractive, but it is also very dangerous. Accidents in nuclear power plants have happened before in Chernobyl and more recently in Fukushima. Both accidents went totally out of control and destroyed the surrounding zones. In addition to the risk of accidents, there is the problem of nuclear waste. It will keep producing radiation for centuries and today we have no satisfying solution for the transport and the storage of nuclear waste.
For the above stated reasons, I believe, that even if nuclear power has enormous benefits, the dangers inherent to this technologies are so significant that they outweigh all possible benefits.",8,band-8-essay-sample-advantages-of-nuclear-energy-outweigh-disadvantages
713,"Fresh water has always been a limited resource in some parts of the world. Today, however, growing worldwide demand has made this a global problem.","Since time immemorial, in certain drier parts of the world, fresh water has always been a scarce natural resource. However, in the present time, due to various reasons, scarcity of fresh water has become a global issue. This essay will illustrate some factors contributing to this problem and will also suggest certain steps that can help the national authorities and individuals in controlling this growing demand for natural salt free water.
Firstly, population explosion is the factor of utmost importance, which has led to the global surge in potable water requirement. Secondly, increased pollution of natural fresh water reserves due to urbanisation and industrialization has compounded this demand. Furthermore, in modern times, the growing use of fresh water for activities like recreational swimming has also catalysed the surge in global water demand.
National authorities, on the other hand, can control this surge by implementing public education schemes regarding judicious use of water. Strict national legislations for preventing natural fresh water reserve pollution are also required. Moreover, governments should build facilities for purification of seawater into saline free water. This will help in meeting the growing requirement for fresh water.
Similarly, public can also contribute towards this noble cause by conserving water and also by limiting their daily household water usage. They should refrain themselves from performing activities that will pollute natural fresh water reserves.
Thus even though, the scarcity of fresh water is a growing global problem, there are various means and methods available, by which both the government and individuals can prevent this from worsening.",8,band-8-essay-about-the-growing-demand-for-fresh-water-resources
714,The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 28 million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international las introduced to contrôle car ownership and car use. To what agree do you agree or disagree ?,"Since their invention by the end of the 19th century, the use and the number of cars on the roads have increased tremendously in Britain as well as other countries. It is true that cars have made traveling easier, but they have disastrous consequences for nature and mankind. Therefore, I agree with the argument that public measures such as enhancing other forms of transport and passing international laws should be taken to reduce the negative impact of cars.
The negative impact of abusive car use is evident. First of all there is pollution, partly induced by cars. It causes acid rains which destroys forest and water. Chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD are enhanced by pollution. But even cardiovascular diseases and mortality are largely aggravated by bad air quality. It is well known that in days of smog the mortality due to cardiovascular accidents rises in all the big cities.  The abusive car use contributes to the irreplaceable depletion of natural resources. Burning fuel warms up the atmosphere and weather condition will become more and more extreme. The overall use of cars has changed our lifestyle. We sit more and exercise less. This results in bad health conditions.
There are solutions. Governments must encourage alternative forms of transport. This can be done in various ways. Cities must be changed. The car use within town centers can be limited, the number of bicycle ways increased, green areas extended and the public transport improved. The use of car sharing services should be encouraged. This can be done with financial incentives.  The problems linked to abusive car use such as air pollution and resource consumption have become global problems. Therefore I believe they must be addressed  an an international level as well. For example, we need laws in order to limit CO emission.
Based on what I explained above, I think that abusive car use has disastrous consequences on nature and mankind. Solutions exist and must be implemented, first locally but eventually at the international level.",8,band-8-essay-sample-about-excessive-use-of-cars
715,These days literature of all sorts can be easily found on the internet; so one could think that there is no need for libraries anymore.,"While it is true that the internet is a vast treasure house of knowledge and information, I don’t agree with the argument that libraries are no longer needed. Libraries offer far more benefits to a community than online services.  First of all, they allow people to come to a quiet and peaceful place where they can look around, discover books and feel at ease. They can also meet other people sharing the same interest.
Libraries are also a very good place for children and youngsters. Teachers and parents can take them there and introduce them to the magic world of books. They can make them discover and hopefully appreciate books and the knowledge they contain.
Today we are overwhelmed by information coming from all sorts of sources. Anyone can publish information online. There is no easy way to find out whether the information we find online is true or false. Books, on the other hand, are brought out by trusted publishers. This makes books a more reliable source of information than the internet. Moreover, libraries often host cultural events such as lectures and exhibitions and contribute to the development of a community.
Last but not least, public libraries are open for everyone. Not every person has access to the internet or can afford the electronic device necessary to download and read books. Furthermore, some people, especially the elderly, are not comfortable reading on a screen.
For all the reasons listed above, I believe that public libraries are still required.  They are places that promote culture, teaching and learning. They offer opportunities for people to meet and discuss and thus strengthen the community. A healthy and dynamic community is a major asset for every town.",8,band-8-essay-sample-libraries-are-no-longer-required
716,Many people think that job satisfaction is important in work. Do you think young people these days should be sure of getting job satisfaction before taking a job or should they put salary first?,"Reader’s essay
Job satisfaction is an important criterion for many people. In my opinion, being happy with the job should be the key reason why somebody chooses a job in the first place and therefore it should be put above anything else, including salary. But, this does not mean that salary should be completely overlooked while searching for a job.
Looking for a job is a daunting process and there are key factors that must be considered. The most important one, in my view, is making sure that the individual is pleased with the job they have chosen not just because of the salary or benefits, but because of the work they will be doing. If, for example, the job an individual chooses requires a large amount of physical work with a good pay but they are not very suited for that, it would drastically affect their work performance and mood. This could lead to a huge amount of stress on the worker and they may end up quitting which puts them back to square one. So, job seekers ought to thoroughly search the requirements that comes with the job they are interested in and think if they can handle all of those personally before applying.
However, salary, the second most important factor should not be ignored or overlooked during the process of job searching. The government makes sure that all workers get paid the minimum wage, but that is not enough in many cases.
In my opinion, job satisfaction and salary are the two most important factors to be considered while choosing a job; of these, job satisfaction should always come first before making a decision in that regard.",8,band-8-essay-sample-is-job-satisfaction-important
717,The birth rate in most developed countries is predicted to begin to fall over the next 50 years. By 2030 it is estimated that over one third of the population in most developed countries will be aged 65 and over. What effects will these predictions have on developed countries if they prove true? What can be done now to deal with this situation?,"Sample essay
It has been predicted that by the year 2030 the population of senior citizens aged 65 and above will account for one third of the total, due to a decline of birthrates. I believe that, if the above prediction comes true, it will have a great impact on the countries’ economy; however, there are measures that can be taken to prevent such a situation from arising.
Modern living has made life quite a struggle. Individuals find it difficult to juggle work commitments and family demands. For example, although weekends are meant for relaxing and spending time with family, most of us use it to catch up with pending work and house chores. Most individuals prefer to have one child or no children at all as a way to overcome their hectic life; thus it is likely that the above prediction will prove true. This is a major problem as it will greatly influence the countries’ economy; income tax earned will be low and productivity and quality of work will decline as the younger generation will be required to work harder to support the elderly and their families.
Strategies need to be put in place in order to overcome the predicted situation. Individuals should be encouraged to have more children by providing incentives such as free education, health and allowance benefits for children. Companies should reduce workload on their employees and discourage the tendency to take work home. This will enable people to spend more time with their families. In my point of view, the above strategies will encourage more people to start a family and increase the overall birthrate.
To conclude, work life balance is necessary for the development of a country. Reducing work load improves performance and quality of work, at the same time enabling a person to have enough time for family, thus eliminating the possibility of the above prediction coming true.",8,band-8-essay-sample-birthrates-are-dropping-in-the-developed-world
718,Essay topic,"Sample response
Most families find it necessary for both parents to work out of the home to meet demands of this competitive world. I agree that children in these families enjoy the extra earning; however, I also believe they miss out on their parents support.
Children, who come from families where both parents work, enjoy a luxurious life; most of their demands are met; they travel often; have better education opportunities, and are financially secure. This is because of the extra earning that allows such families to afford the luxuries of life. For instance, if the father’s salary pays for house expenses, the mother’s can be used for holidays or other luxuries. This is an advantage because when families are financially stable, there is less stress in the home, bringing about a peaceful environment for children to grow up in and reducing the possibility of stress related conditions to both parents and children.
On the flip side, working parents do not know how their children spend their time in their absence. For example, when parents come home from work, they are exhausted and do not spend time with their children. This is a problem and children may resort to seeking guidance from friends or television and may be influenced by peer pressure or join gangs, increasing the rate of school dropouts. A balance between work and family is mandatory for the wellbeing of children.
In conclusion, a luxurious life is not sufficient; children need their parents’ guidance and support as they grow. It is the responsibility of parents to make sure they are aware of the happenings in their children’s life and guide them accordingly.",8,band-8-essay-sample-when-both-parents-work-how-are-children-affected

In this fast evolving world we live in, computers and other devices have almost as much capability as human do. However, even the most advanced computer is still not able to analyse natural languages in the depth that each of us do on a daily basis. Therefore, I disagree that human translators or interpreters are not in demand any more. In this essay I am going to discuss about obvious benefits that natural translators have over the Artificial Intelligence.
To begin with, any language evolves throughout its life. New slang words are developed approximately each day. Even if we had an infinite amount of storage resources, it would be impossible to save all this data. Even though human translators are not able to memorize this information as well, they can guess a meaning of a word by a context of sentences. Currently, there is no such machine that would perform this sort of analysis quickly enough.
Another advantage of natural interpreters is an ability to learn new words and grammatical structures faster than any modern device can do. There is a new field of study in Computer Science called Machine Learning that concentrates its focus on making computers think like human. In order to learn, each word has to be programmed by a person, in conjunction with its synonyms and antonyms. As can be seen, human translators are more independent and fast progressing than the programmed one.
To recapitulate, it is necessary to say that even though human interpreters may make mistakes, they still provide better services than any machine. At the current stage, Artificial Intelligence is not powerful enough to replace people in some of the fields, and I do not think it will be possible in the nearest future",8,band-7-5-essay-sample-about-translation-apps
720,"Nowadays many women are joining the police and military forces. However, some people believe that these jobs are not suitable for women. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","A lot of women joined police and military forces during the last two decades. Many of them were highly successful and they played a huge role in empowering women all over the world. They proved that nothing is impossible if one is determined to achieve it. Some people, nonetheless, feel that these jobs aren’t suitable for women. I don’t agree with this view.
Women have proved their mettle in almost every field. They have proved that they can become great scientists, soldiers, pilots, astronauts and sailors. Therefore, there is no justification for claiming that they are not suitable for joining the armed forces.
Stereotypes exist and that is the reason some people undermine the potential of women. They feel that women lack the level of fitness required for joining police or armed forces. This is a misconception and lots of women have shattered this myth. Generally speaking women are less aggressive than men. They are caring and patient. That is why they make excellent teachers and doctors. Just because women are more caring and patient than men, men never shied away from pursuing careers in those sectors. Likewise, just because women are less aggressive than men, they should not be discouraged from becoming police officers and soldiers. Countless women have already proved that they have what it takes to be successful in such sectors. They are an inspiration for thousands of other women.
People who claim that these jobs are not suitable for women are only seeing one side of the coin. They are undermining the contributions of scores of women who proved that sky is the limit.

721,"The funds for postgraduate research are limited; therefore some people think that the government should provide financial support. In their opinion, only scientific research should be funded, rather than other less useful subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Scientific research is more beneficial than research in other fields. Therefore, I agree with the argument that the government should fund it.
Post graduate research is becoming more and more expensive. As a result very few students are able to pursue it. If the government funds research, it will benefit a lot of scholars. Every stream of knowledge has its uses. It is therefore wrong to classify subjects as useful and less useful. However, certain subjects like science and technology have a greater impact on our lives than other subjects.
Government funds are limited and hence it is impossible for the government to fund all types of research. In this situation, a more sensible option is to fund research in useful subjects like medicine or technology. Research in these fields has the potential to change our lives for the better. For example, medical research may save lives and reduce the cost of healthcare. Likewise, research in the fields of physics or chemistry will result in better appliances and products.
On the other hand, post graduate studies in music or literature have less impact on the world. I am not saying that these subjects aren’t useful. They are useful and in many societies writers and musicians receive more respect than engineers, doctors or scientists. But when we consider the impact these professionals have on our lives, it is not hard to see that scientists or doctors are more useful than painters or musicians.
To conclude, I support the argument that government should fund postgraduate research in scientific subjects. If they have sufficient funds, they should fund other research as well. But if funds are limited, scientific research should be given greater preference.",8,ielts-essay-sample-government-should-only-fund-scientific-research

To what extend do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that moon landing has had little impact on the lives of common people. I agree with this view; however, I don’t think that we should underestimate the importance of this major scientific achievement.
It is certainly true that moon landing is not beneficial to common people and spending money on this adventure is meaningless from that perspective. The government uses public money to fund its space missions. It collects taxes from people. This money should be used for the benefits of the general public and there is no justification for spending it on space adventures.
Millions of people living in under developed countries suffer from famine and draughts. Thousands are dying of hunger. Developing countries are also grappling with problems like illiteracy, unemployment and malnutrition. All of these problems clearly show that the world hasn’t changed in spite of man putting his footprint on the moon.
On the other hand, sending man to the moon was one of the greatest achievements of the last century. When Neil Armstrong set his foot on the moon, scientists made the impossible possible. Moon landing improved our confidence and demonstrated that we could achieve just about anything through science. What’s more, it broke all the superstitions about the galaxy. I personally feel that moon has the potential to become a major tourist destination in the not-so-distant future. NASA has already started the process to shortlist people who would like to travel to the moon. The growth of population is becoming a major problem for us. If it grows at the current rate, the earth will not have enough space to accommodate future generations. So, if we can colonise moon or mars, it will solve the space constraints on earth. Scientists are exploring this possibility.
To conclude, I still believe that by sending man to the moon, we achieved a major scientific breakthrough; however, this achievement has had little impact on the lives of common people.

723,"Employers sometimes ask people applying for jobs for personal information, such as their hobbies and interests, and whether they are married or single. Some people say that this information may be relevant and useful, others disagree. Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.","There are people who argue that the benefits of sharing personal information with one’s employer considerably outweigh the disadvantages. That is because the employer will get to know the employee through the information they shared with them. Nowadays there are software programs that can predict the character and intelligence of an employee on the basis of their interests and hobbies. Using this information the employer can assess the amount of risk they take on by employing a particular person. Every organisation wants to hire employees who fit perfectly into their work culture. Personal information can be useful in several other ways as well.
I remember once I met with an accident while coming back from my office. An onlooker who saw my ID card called up my office and with the help of the personal information I shared with them, my office quickly informed my family.
On the other hand, some people believe that sharing personal information with the employer has no use. According to them giving personal information to the employer is a bit like giving access to your personal life. They believe that personal information is personal and should not be shared with anybody. They have their own reasons to believe so. Recently, a female employee of my organisation was stalked by a male employee who had access to her personal information. He wanted to take undue advantage of the situation.
As we can see, there is no definite answer to this question. I firmly believe that sharing personal information is not a bad idea; however, employers who request the information of their employees have a responsibility to ensure that the data is not misused or shared with a third party without the consent of the employee. In addition, personal information of the employee should be used only for their benefits.",8,band-8-essay-sample-should-employees-share-personal-information-with-the-employer
724,Nowadays businesses face problems with new employees who just finished their education and lack some interpersonal skills such as the ability to work in a team. What do you think is the main cause of the problem? How can it be resolved?,"Our education system places too much emphasis on academic excellence. Students are forced to learn lessons by heart. Unfortunately in this obsession with acquiring textbook wisdom, youngsters often ignore the need to develop good communication and interpersonal skills.
Today, in many sectors, an ability to communicate well and work in a team is important. These skills are often ignored by both parents and teachers. There are parents who don’t even allow their children to engage in extra-curricular activities because they don’t want their children’s academic grades to suffer. They don’t realize that this attitude won’t help their children’s career.
Just because someone is a graduate or a post graduate, it does not mean that they have all the skills required for the workplace. A lot of them lack interpersonal skills. This affects their efficiency and the operating costs of the organisation. Educational institutions put too much emphasis on academics. As a result many students don’t get the practical wisdom that will help them at the workplace.
Our educational system has to be revamped to solve this problem. Universities need to put emphasis on creating employable men and women who will be able to fit into their roles in the workplace. Schools and colleges should also arrange workshops where students can pick up important vocational and communication skills. In other words, universities should shift their focus from theory to practical. Students should be put in real life situations where they get to work with others and find solutions to common problems.

To what extent you agree or disagree? Give your opinion.","Nowadays, many universities require students to choose specialised subjects for their studies. Some people believe that this is a faulty approach. In their opinion, educational institutes should encourage students to study a variety of subjects. I agree with this view.
Universities should promote all subjects and explain how students can improve their career prospects by learning various subjects. Not all students are supposed to become doctors or engineers. The society needs people possessing various skills. There is yet another dimension to this. When several students learn a particular subject, the demand for that subject will eventually decrease.  For example, if everyone opted for computer science, students completing that course will find it difficult to get jobs. In such a situation, the demand for other subjects will increase.
When students learn various subjects instead of focusing on one subject, they will be able to address the needs of the society. This, in turn, will help the growth of the economy.
On the other hand, if everyone studied the same subject, they all would find job in the same industry. Any global economic crisis in that sector will ruin their future and affect the growth of the nation. For example, in India most students prefer to study computer engineering. As a result, software engineers are a dime a dozen in the country. Many of them are struggling to find employment because the supply exceeds the demand. Worse still, a crisis in the IT industry affects all of them and the economy of the nation.
To conclude, the subjects that students learn should not only support their individual growth but also help the development of the nation. Therefore, universities should promote all subjects instead of a handful of prestigious subjects.",8,band-8-essay-sample-students-should-learn-various-subjects

What can be done to prevent it? Give your opinion including reasons and examples from your own experience.","Tourist places like beaches, hills and mountains attract a large number of visitors. The increase in human activity in these places also leads to littering. In fact, littering has become a major environmental issue in many tourist places.
When tourists throw around plastic cans and bottles, they not only destroy the natural beauty of picnic places but also cause many environmental problems. Fish and wild animals often swallow polythene wrappers while trying to eat the leftover food in them. This causes infection inside their body and eventually leads to their death. People are thronging to wildlife sanctuaries to get an opportunity to watch animals in their natural habitat. Unfortunately, they also leave behind a lot of things that can harm the environment and the wildlife.
In order to prevent this from happening, we need stringent laws. The government should impose hefty fines on people who violate these laws. There is little we can achieve by enacting laws. Enforcement is the key. For example, India has plenty of laws to protect the environment. Unfortunately, these laws aren’t always enforced and littering is rampant in this part of the world.
The government should also install facilities like recycling machines where tourists can drop their plastic bottles and cans. Another solution is to encourage the use of natural and biodegradable materials instead of plastic. In addition, the government should consider running eateries in these places where people can buy good food and water at reasonable rates. In many picnic places restaurants overcharge tourists. This forces many tourists to carry food and snacks with them. If there are restaurants and eateries that offer hygienic food at affordable rates, people will be less inclined to carry their food with them.
To conclude, picnic spots attract a large number of visitors. Unfortunately, this leads to littering. The only viable solution to this problem is to limit and discourage the use of plastic in these places through stringent laws and by installing recycling machines.",8,ielts-essay-about-littering-in-public-places
727,Today more and more old cities are being rebuilt and redesigned in order to be modernized. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend? Give your opinion and relevant examples.,"Old cities lack modern amenities. They can no longer accommodate the needs of the modern society. Because of this reason, they are being rebuilt. In my opinion, there are several benefits to rebuilding old cities.
Most cities are now bulging at the seams. As more and more people move to cities in search of jobs and a better lifestyle, cities become even more congested. They are struggling to cope with the increased stress on their resources. For example in Mumbai and its suburbs, the need for homes is on the rise. Going vertical is the only situation to this problem. Because of this reason, old and dilapidated buildings are being demolished to make way for skyscrapers.
Old cities lack proper sewage or waste disposal systems. When population increases the need for water and power also increases. Many old cities lack supporting infrastructure. Narrow roads are a problem that plagues most old cities. To accommodate the growing number of vehicles, roads have to be widened. This would not be possible without demolishing the buildings on either side. In addition, bigger water pipes have to be laid to accommodate the growing need for water.
Cities are built for people. They have to evolve with the times. Otherwise, they would not be able to cope with the demands of the urban population. There is a minor disadvantage to this. When cities change, they often lose their old world charm. Sometimes historically important buildings are demolished to make way for newer structures. This practice has to be discouraged. Civic authorities can play an important role in this. They need to understand the importance of preserving historically important buildings.
To conclude, there are several advantages to redesigning old cities. Cities are meant for people. If they can’t meet the needs of the people, they become useless.",8,ielts-essay-sample-should-old-cities-be-redesigned
728,"Some say that young and energetic employees are the more valuable for the company, others argue that older employees have more experience and knowledge. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and examples, based on you own experience.","A typical organization employs both young and old people. It is impossible to say whether young employees are more valuable than old employees or vice-versa because both of them have their plusses and minuses.
Startups tend to hire younger employees because they need energetic people who are full of innovative ideas. Young people can come up with interesting and unique ideas that have the potential to become hugely successful products or services. Take a closer look at the IT sector. It is not hard to see that most startups are founded by young men or women.
There is another benefit to hiring young people. Many of them are unmarried and hence free of domestic duties and liabilities. This allows them to work long hours. Also, young people are well-versed in new technologies. They are more flexible and adaptable. Better still, they are less expensive because young employees are paid less than old employees.
On the flip side, youngsters lack experience. They may be bustling with ideas but many of them lack the skills or experience required to implement those ideas. Also, young people tend to act rashly. Older employees have years of experience in the industry. They have connections that can help their organization in many ways. They have seen the ups and downs of the business and can even foresee trends. This ability makes them an asset for the organization. They can also guide the younger folk.
After analyzing the situation, it is not hard to see that an organization needs both young and old people to function successfully and having the right mix of fresh and experienced employees will help it scale new heights.

With the technology available today there is no justification for it, and everything should be done online. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion.","Technology has changed every aspect of our life. It has changed the way we shop and communicate. It has also changed the way we access information and learn. Both students and teachers have adopted technology in a big way. Still, in a large number of schools and colleges around the world education is imparted orally. A teacher or a professor standing in front of a large number of students explains the lessons orally. Some people believe that such methods should be replaced by online teaching and learning. However, I beg to differ.
Online learning certainly has some advantages, but we still don’t have enough data to prove that it is better than conventional methods of teaching. When students learn from a teacher in a classroom, they are actively involved in the learning process. Several studies have shown that online learning is less effective than attending a classroom. Also, traditional classrooms give students an opportunity to interact with one another. And if they have any doubts, they can get them cleared instantly. Students can also exchange their notes and handbooks.
This, however, does not mean that technology hasn’t helped the process of learning. In fact, the internet has played a vital role in education. With the help of the internet, people can find information on any subject. The internet has also made it possible for students to learn a foreign language from their country. For example, a student does not have to travel to China to learn Chinese. They can find Chinese tutors online and learn from the comforts of their home.
To include, technology has certainly made learning easier. However, I don’t believe that the internet should replace teachers. In my opinion, the traditional method of teaching is way better.",8,ielts-essay-all-learning-should-be-done-online
731,"Apart from many advantages, people think the internet has created some disadvantages too. To what intent do you agree or disagree?","Ever since the advent of the internet people have wondered whether it is a boon or a curse to the society. There is no denying the fact that the internet has benefited our society. In my opinion, it has caused several problems as well.
Over the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people who use the internet. People now shop online; they perform banking transactions on the go. Unfortunately, there has also been a dramatic increase in cyber-crime. Each year, cybercrime causes losses amounting to billions of dollars. This has made people wary of online banking.
Social media addiction is another problem. Almost all of us are active on social media these days. Excessive use of social media is known to cause several psychological problems. Cyber bullying is also on the rise. People’s privacy often gets violated on the internet. The internet has also wreaked havoc with people’s lives. There have been several cases where victims of cyber bullying committed suicide. Social media has also caused alienation. In addition to this, anti-social elements sell pirated e-Books, movies and CDs on the internet and cause huge losses to the industry.
The internet provides limitless access to obscene or violent content. While surfing the web, children may access them unwittingly. When kids get exposed to inappropriate content, it can have far reaching negative consequences. Worse still, nowadays terrorist organizations use the internet to recruit youngsters and propagate their agenda.
To conclude, the internet has both positive and negative aspects. It has benefited our society in countless ways. It has also caused numerous problems. If we really want to take advantage of its potential, we should learn to use it more responsibly. In addition, there should be stringent laws to deal with cybercrime.",8,ielts-essay-is-internet-good-or-bad
732,A large number of students now prefer to work part time. Is this a positive or a negative development?,"There has been a dramatic increase in the number of youngsters who work part time. This working arrangement has several benefits and hence I believe that it is a positive trend.
Part time jobs give financial independence to young people. In western countries most university students take up part time jobs to fund their education. When students work part time, they can take care of their personal expenses such as food, accommodation and clothing on their own.
Part time jobs help students coming from both rich and poor families, but they are particular beneficial to poor students. It is not uncommon for students to drop out of school/college because of financial problems. Part time employment will help prevent this situation. Part time jobs also help youngsters to become responsible and independent. Students who work and earn do not have to depend on their family for financial assistance. They also learn the importance of spending money wisely.
It is true that part time jobs have some disadvantages as well. Students who start working at a young age may show a greater tendency to drop out of school. This is particularly true in the case of students coming from poor families. Many of them will take up a full time job and discontinue their studies. This has a negative impact on their long term career prospects. However, I feel that parents and teachers can prevent this situation from arising.
To conclude, part time employment has more advantages than disadvantages. The negative aspect of this kind of employment can be controlled by taking adequate preventive measures. In my opinion, every youngster should take up a part time job to fund their studies.",8,ielts-about-the-growing-popularity-of-part-time-jobs
733,Topic,"There has been a dramatic increase in criminal activities in urban areas. One only has to read the newspapers or watch television channels to get inundated with stories about crimes. Several factors are responsible for this development. I will discuss them in this essay.
The cost of living has increased immensely in recent times. A large number of people are not even able to put food on the table. When they fail to feed their family, they may get involved in offenses such as shop lifting and robbery. There has also been an increase in the number of people who migrate to urban areas for employment and a better lifestyle. Unfortunately, many of them fail to find jobs and eventually turn to crime to make a living.
Teenagers are often involved in criminal activities. They are influenced by movies and the programs shown on television. In addition, the internet has plenty of resources that encourage people to commit crimes.
The government can play an important role in reducing the crime rate. To start with, the number of policemen patrolling the streets should be increased. The police should also monitor the activities of young students who drop out of school. Parents too need to keep a tab on their children. Finally, the rehabilitation programs in prisons should teach prisoners personal and social skills along with vocational training in order to make them better citizens.
In conclusion, although a number of factors can be responsible for increasing the crime rate, the government can help to control the situation.",8,ielts-essay-why-is-the-crime-rate-increasing
734,"Should arts-related entertainment venues such as museums and art galleries be free of charge for the general public, or should a charge apply for admittance?","Some people believe that museums and art galleries should charge an entry fee; others, however, do not agree with this view. In my opinion, the application of the entry fee should depend upon the specific form of entertainment provided.
An exhibition of foreign arts and artefacts should be chargeable because the host country has to spend a lot of money to bring exotic artefacts and other art forms into their country. The US, for example, held an exhibition of arts and crafts about the Egyptian culture and they charged a fee. I feel that charging an entry fee is perfectly acceptable in such cases. The fee will help the host recover the transportation and maintenance costs involved in displaying those works in the museum.
On the other hand, entry to local museums and art galleries should be free for the local people as well as foreign visitors. Local museums reveal the ancient history and culture of a country. They are the pure reflection of the local culture. Many local museums store the books, magazines, video clips and important documents that help visitors understand the history of the country. By offering free entry into these museums the government can also help spread the culture of the country.
In conclusion, the specific form of the entertainment should determine whether there should be an entry fee. An exhibition of foreign arts and collections require funds for maintenance and hence there should be an entry fee in this case. Local museums and art galleries should be sponsored by the local government.

735,Nowadays in some countries the number of children aged 15 and younger are increasing. What are the current and future effects of ever increasing population?,"In many countries there is a dramatic increase in the number of young people. This development has far reaching implications. In this essay, I will examine the present and future impacts of the rise in the population of children.
When there is an increase in the number of children, the demand for schools and teachers also increases. Unfortunately, many countries do not have enough schools to admit all the children. For example, in China the number of school-aged children is very high; however, the country does not have enough good schools. As a result, many students do not have access to quality education. The situation is not much different in India.
The growth in the number of children can be attributed to the failure of family planning in these countries. When families have several children, it becomes difficult for them to cater to the needs of everyone. If families limit themselves to one or two children, they will be able to give more care and attention to those children.
The rise in the number of young people will lead to unemployment in the future. And when youngsters can’t find jobs in their country, they will be forced to emigrate. This leads to the undesirable brain drain. When several applicants fight for the same job, finding employment will become more difficult. This will encourage unemployed people from developing nations like India and China to immigrate to countries like the US and Canada.
To conclude, the growing population of children below the age of 15 will impact the present and the future in many ways. This trend calls for the allocation of more resources to education. It also demands the generation of more jobs.",8,ielts-essay-sample-effects-of-increasing-population
736,Some people believe that the internet should be regulated. Others are against any forms of internet censorship. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The internet gives us access to limitless amounts of information. There is no denying the fact that it exposes us to both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ content. Some people believe that the internet should be regulated and censored. Others disapprove of any kind of censorship because they feel that the internet is a vent through which the oppressed can express their opinion.
Supporters of internet censorship argue that the internet has content that might be inappropriate for certain people. For example, they don’t want children to be exposed to the online terrorist propaganda or pornographic materials. This is indeed a valid point. The internet does host lots of materials that are inappropriate for young children.
However, many people do not regard this argument as legit. In their opinion there are several ways to block inappropriate content. Parental control software is one of them. It is quite effective and allows parents to control the content their children access online. In fact, parents can exercise the best form of control by simply moving the computer to the living room. This way they can keep a tab on their children’s online activities.
Some totalitarian governments use the inappropriate content argument for their benefit. They censor the internet to suppress their opposition. In my opinion, this cannot be tolerated at all. Governments that control the internet are merely demonstrating their inability to manage their affairs. They are afraid of their people and don’t want their opinions to be heard. National security is important but it cannot be at the expense of freedom.
To conclude, I firmly believe that there are no valid grounds for internet censorship. I sincerely hope that governments around the world will understand this and stop censoring the internet.",8,band-8-essay-sample-the-internet-should-be-controlled
737,"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?","It is generally observed that criminals indulge in more legal offenses after being punished the first time. This is a result of improper legal system, which has a negative effect on the defected mentality that wrongdoers have in the first place. Therefore, rehabilitation measures need to be taken to remedy offender’s miss-calculations.
The reason people who are found guilty continue to breach the law once and again is their exacerbated negative state of mind. In other words, the negative psychological state which cases them to go against the legal framework in the first place is not only still existence, but it is even more entrenched after they are humiliated and punished. In most cases, people offend due to the feeling of self-worthlessness, despair or greed. In my opinion, the current reckless and brutal punishment scheme, characterized by humiliation, isolation and low social interaction, contributes to growing these traits, which instigates them to commit more illegal actions.
There are various measures that can be taken to deal with this issue. First, it is crucial to identify the negative feelings that caused the illegal action. After identifying the root cause of the offender’s action, trained psychological therapist can design a tailored program to remedy such thoughts.
In fact, the decision to attempt a crime is no different than one to commit suicide. Both may lead to consequences of different magnitude, but they both stem from negative states of mind. Therefore, people who perform criminal actions need to undergo similar therapies as those who think of taking their own lives away.  For example, in Denmark prisons have a very constructive system, where prisoners get to learn about healthy living habits, while being treated with respect. This has had tremendous results, and most Danish citizens who commit crimes, refrain from doing so after serving their sentence in prison.
In short, the conventional imprisonment system is more destructive to criminals that it is constructive. It is then apt for governments to start dealing with psychological faults that causes people to enact illegal actions.",8,band-8-essay-sample-many-offenders-commit-more-crimes-after-serving-the-first-punishment
738,There are several advantages to hosting an international sporting event. There are disadvantages too. Discuss both views and state your opinion.,"The location of global sports events often results in a competition between nations. Although there are clear downsides for hosting such events, I think the benefits make it attractive.
There are several drawbacks for countries where major sports events take place. Firstly, there is a notable security threat to the host country due to the sudden influx of people from across the globe, which makes it harder to undergo a thorough security check on all of them. Additionally, the venues of the events may be targeted by terrorist groups. Secondly, many fans often choose to use drugs while watching their favourite events. Intoxicated fans could over-react, which may lead to problems such as fights and other illegal actions. Nevertheless, I believe such negative consequences can be overcome by increasing security measures.
In fact I believe hosting sports events that are recognized worldwide bring more benefits than harm. Primarily, the host country undergoes significant financial activities, which boosts the economy. This is mainly due to the tourists coming to watch the events. As a result, local businesses also flourish. These businesses can also leverage their interaction with international costumers by learning about their tastes and preferences. This can help guide their entrepreneurial decisions if they choose to internationalize their business. Moreover, the host country gains significant prestige in the international arena, which also drives more tourists in the future.
In conclusion, I would argue that despite the apparent harmful consequences of hosting international sports events, the benefits of doing so make it a worthy venture.

739,Young people are getting more influenced by friends than parents or teachers. Do you agree or disagree?,"There is no denying the fact that young people are more influenced by their friends than their teachers or parents. They spend more time with their friends. It is quite natural for them to get influenced by the people they spend time with.
Parents are the biggest influence on children during the first few years of their life because young children don’t get many opportunities to interact with the world outside their family. When they begin to attend school, their friends begin to play a more important role in their life. Young children want to dress and behave like their friends.
Friends exert an even bigger influence on teenagers. Teens tend to have a rebellious streak in them. They seek freedom and hate it when parents or teachers try to impose restrictions on them. They find the company of their friends more attractive because people of the same age groups have similar needs, interests and tastes.
Parents and teachers often assume the role of advisors. They are well-meaning; unfortunately, teens hate advice. The huge generation gap between children and their parents do not help the situation either. Teenagers today have access to a lot of things that their parents didn’t have when they were young. At this age, boys and girls experience an irresistible need to fit in with their group. This need encourages them to adopt the beliefs and behaviors of their friends. Since parents and teachers do not always agree with them, they find solace in the company of their friends.
To conclude, I totally agree with the statement that young people are more influenced by their friends. However, I do not feel that this is a positive trend because friends are unlikely to have the unconditional love that parents have for their children. They also lack the worldly wisdom that parents or teachers have.",8,ielts-essay-friends-have-a-greater-influence-than-parents-on-young-people
740,These days many fathers stay at home and take care of their children while mothers go out to work. What could be the reason for this? Do you think it is a positive or a negative development?,"Thanks to widespread women’s rights movements, more and more women have become the breadwinners for their family while their husbands stay at home looking after the kids. In my opinion, this is the result of an extreme, yet naïve ideology that has created an imbalance in many families.
Organised groups which call for absolute equality between men and women are often shallow minded. Many such groups make illogical demands such as giving both couples exactly equal and reversible rights and responsibilities. In theory, this sounds fair and square. However, when you look at the details, it is not hard to see that this arrangement paralyzes both men and women by reversing their natural roles.
Improper allocation of roles puts exceedingly high pressure on women, and renders men’s roles rather ineffective. When women are the primary breadwinners for the family, they cannot afford to take long maternity leaves. Not only because such holidays may be unpaid, but also because they need to progress in their jobs to support their expanding family.
It is a well-known fact that mothers develop better bonds with new born babies. In addition, babies need to be breastfed multiple times during the day. This will not be possible if the mother has a demanding job that requires her to be away from the child for long hours. Therefore, it is counter-productive for the father to be the main caretaker. That said, it is indeed productive for the man to help with raising kids. The woman should also work to secure the financial future of the family.
In short, it is plausible for partners to share their domestic responsibilities, but an arrangement where mothers earn a living and fathers stay at home is way too extreme.",8,band-8-essay-sample-stay-at-home-dads
741,"With the availability of information on the internet, public libraries are no longer necessary. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is often argued that public libraries have become redundant because of the easy availability of information online. However, I totally disagree with this idea.
It is true that all information known to the mankind is now available on the internet. Internet accessibility has also improved over the years. However, this does not mean that public libraries are no longer needed.
Libraries are much more than mere access points for books and information. They serve some other purposes as well. For example, libraries provide a quiet environment where one can read and learn. Distractions of everyday life can kill the joy of reading. Libraries offer a solution to this problem.     Also, when you are in an environment where everyone is reading, you will also be motivated to get your reading done. This may not be possible at home, even if you can find the same reading material online.
The internet is a vast pool of information but if you don’t know what you are looking for, it is nearly impossible to find relevant information online. Libraries, on the other hand, make research easier by grouping books on a particular topic together. Even if you don’t know anything about a given topic, you will still be able to find relevant information on that topic. Today’s libraries also provide access to computers and tablets so that users can search online if they need more information on a topic.
Internet accessibility may have improved over the years, but there are still millions of people who do not have access to the internet. Public libraries are the only sources of information for them. If libraries were to die, they would be in trouble.
To conclude, despite the existence of all information online, libraries are still important because they provide an environment conducive to reading and learning.",8,band-8-essay-public-libraries-are-no-longer-required-because-of-the-internet
742,Some people like to work in a company which offers high salary. Some others think that it is good to work in a company which offers a good working atmosphere. What is your opinion? Discuss both the views with examples.,"Some people prefer high-paying jobs. Others place more importance on the quality of the workplace. This is basically a matter of personal preference and I don’t think that one option is better than the other. It depends on the unique circumstances of the employee.
In the developing countries many families have a single source of income. Consequently, they need a well-paying job to take care of their expenses. Also, in many of these countries, people don’t get any financial support from their governments. All of these factors encourage them to opt for a job with a higher salary. Companies also believe that employees will deliver their best performance when they are offered a good salary.
The situation is somewhat different in the developed world where many families have multiple sources of income. People in these countries also get a lot of benefits from their government. Needless to say, they are not concerned about earning more money; they would rather prefer a good working environment.
There is yet another reason for this preference. The working environment affects the employees’ performance in many ways. A study conducted by a multinational company revealed that a good working environment enhances the efficiency of the employees because it keeps them relaxed. And employees tend to work better when they are relaxed.
In my opinion, money is as important as the quality of the workplace. After all, everybody should be able to earn enough to lead a comfortable life.

744,Task,"This is a good essay. There are, however, some mistakes. Here is the corrected version of this essay.
Nowadays, money has become more important than ever. In a world where resources are diminishing and competition amongst the workforce is intensifying, earning money is getting harder by the day. Hence, one should be able to manage money wisely to control expenses as much as possible. In order to acquire money management skills, one must be trained since young (write: since childhood) to be financially responsible individual (write: a financially responsible individual).
Remarks
There are not many grammar mistakes in the opening paragraph, but it is too long. Your introduction should have just 2 or 3 sentences. Also when the prompt asks ‘do you agree or disagree’, you have to state your opinion in the opening paragraph. This is very important.
So, you could have written something like this.
Nowadays, money has become more important than ever. In a world where resources are diminishing and competition amongst the workforce is intensifying, earning money is getting harder by the day. Hence I believe that children should be taught the importance of money. However, our methods have to be appropriate for their age.
There are many benefits of teaching children about money management. First of all, when a child realizes the value of money, he is likely to develop skills and habits that would make them (write: him) great money savers (write: a great money saver).
In addition to being good with money, awareness about the value of money will help a child to be successful in every aspect of his life. Since he is likely to be financially stable, he will also have a stable family. Thus, the consequences of learning about money management have astounding effects on a child’s future.
Remarks
The words consequences and effects mean more or less the same.
You can write:
Thus good money management skills can have astounding effects on a child’s future.
However, emphasizing upon money beyond limits (write: too much emphasis on money) would cause a child to be stressed all the time. Due to being subjected to continuous stress, a child would be more susceptible to depression.
Remarks
Avoid phrases like ‘due to being’. ‘Due to’ should be followed by a noun. ‘Because of’ is a much better alternative because at least some people believe that ‘due to’ cannot go at the beginning of a sentence.
You can rewrite your sentence as:
However, too much emphasis on money will cause a child to be stressed all the time. And stress can make the child more susceptible to depression.
Also, it may alter a child’s definitions to the extent that he may consider making (remove this) money as the only measure of success.
Remarks
You can write:
Also, it may alter a child’s definitions to the extent that he will consider the size of the wallet as the only measure of success.
In conclusion, it is of paramount importance that a child learns about the significance of money in life. However, we ought not to forget that a child may not have the full capacity to grasp the impact of money on our lives. Therefore, our methods to do so (remove this) should be appropriate for our children.
Analysis
This is a good essay. There are some grammar mistakes.
You have to make some changes to the structure. When they ask ‘do you agree or disagree?’ you have to state your opinion in the introduction. You have to state it in the conclusion as well.
Overall, this seems to be a band 8 essay.

745,More and more wild animals are on the verge of extinction and others are on the endangered list. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"The last few years have experienced burgeoning growth in the number of animal species facing the threat of extinction.  In my opinion, this happens mainly due to hunting and changing environmental conditions. Some measures can be taken to prevent the situation from getting worse.
Firstly, man hunts animals not only for food but also for aesthetic products. Owing to the fact that some animals have commercial value, hunters exploit them. For instance, tiger skin is used widely for making mattresses and blankets, and this leads to indiscriminate killing and the extinction of this species, because people show interest in buying exquisite products. Although every animal is not for food, some cuisines include wild endangered ones. Secondly, due to human intervention in the previously unexploited areas, climate has changed which makes it difficult for some species to survive in their natural habitat. For example, Penguins are in the endangered list as global warming poses threats to their survival.
One way to protect endangered animals is to rehabilitate them in artificial environment such as zoo. Some animals may have special dietary and environmental needs which are only possible if they are treated separately.  Another possible solution is to establish breeding program so that there can be an improvement in the number of younger ones. Also, if strict action is taken against those who violate the law and poach wild life, then the extinction due to human intervention can be avoided.
To conclude, a variety of factors such as human intervention, excessive poaching and change in climate cause the extinction of wildlife. By enacting stringent ant-poaching laws we can improve the situation to a great extent. It is also important to protect endangered species in zoos and dedicated wildlife sanctuaries.",7.5,more-and-more-wild-animals-are-on-the-verge-on-extinction-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
746,In some societies the number of crime committed by teenagers is growing. Some people think that regardless of age teenagers who commit major crime receive adult punishment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In some countries, the number of youngsters involved in criminal activities is increasing. It is argued that youngsters who commit serious crimes ought to receive the standard penalty regardless of their age. I totally disagree with this viewpoint because children have impressionable minds so proper counselling can help to bring them to the right track. Secondly, law and order should be made as a part of their school curriculum. I will discuss these points in detail in the subsequent paragraphs.
First and foremost, since children have impressionable minds, rigorous counselling can help them to overcome criminal tendencies. As they are in their growing phase, they develop such habits through their social circle or they try to imitate the movie actors. In the USA, as per the latest survey taken by the law authorities counselling has helped a lot of young minds to come to the right track and has curbed the crime rates to a large extent. Hence, it is clear that a soft approach such as counselling is an effective method to bring back adolescents to the correct path.
Furthermore, law and order should be made as a part of their school curriculum which can further help them to better understand the legal system. We often see that adolescents are unaware of the intensity of crimes in which they get involved at a very tender age. Thus, making law and order as a part of their school studies can be an effective measure to teach and guide them. To illustrate this, as per Harvard Business Review, the educational institutions which teach law to their students have become successful in making them the good citizens of the society.
To conclude, it is quite evident that proper counselling can play a crucial role in reforming the young minds of a country. Moreover, teaching law right from the school can further aid to curb the crimes rates.",7.5,teenagers-who-commit-serious-crimes-should-receive-adult-punishment-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?,"The last few years have experienced burgeoning growth in the field of communication technology and transportation, which enables people to work and live in any part of the world. In my opinion, it has lots of advantages when compared to minor drawbacks that it might bring.
Despite the drawbacks mentioned below, I believe that advancement in communication technology and transportation offers definite perks. Firstly, it provides better employment opportunities and thereby helps in the amelioration of a person’s standard of living.  Consequently, their children also get access to better amenities so that the future generation is also benefited. Secondly, people around the world are brought together which paves the way for them to understand the world better. Distance is no more a barrier for people to reach their heights. Another point to consider is that when people flock to a certain place, to cater to their needs, there would be a development in the basic facilities.
Admittedly, when people work and settle abroad, it has some detrimental effects on the society. People seem to be ignorant of the cultural values and instead of serving their own country, they are swayed by the monetary benefits offered by the foreign country. If people move to various parts of the world, society as a whole becomes increasingly disjointed and fragmented. Moreover, instead of getting care from their grandparents, children of immigrant families are taken care of by baby sitters and after-school child care.
To conclude, in my opinion, the benefits of getting employed and settling abroad eclipse the minor drawbacks it brings. People get not only better job opportunity, but also better standard of living with the improvement of communication technology and transportation.",7.5,people-now-have-the-freedom-to-work-and-live-anywhere-in-the-world-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

Do you agree or disagree?,"While some people think that smart phones play an important role in the learning process of students, others believe that excessive use of these devices does not help to achieve academic objectives. This essay is against / I am against the excessive use of smart phones among teenagers because after spending much of their time on these devices, teenagers are left with no time for their studies. Moreover, children do not like to play sports because they prefer to play games with their mobile phones.
When teenagers spend most of their time on mobile phones, it is natural that they will not have time for academic studies. The time spent on phones is not productive; therefore, traditional academic learning should be encouraged instead. Also, juveniles who are always glued to their phone use it excessively for chatting with their friends. While chatting is not particularly bad, the problem is that they use weird abbreviations and SMS lingos to convey ideas. Their conversation makes practically no sense to someone who is not familiar with this time. At the same time, they fail to learn to communicate using standard words and expressions. No doubt, this generation of students has poor written communication skills.
Spending excessive time on their phones also prevents students from reading. Earlier people used to read when they had free time. Actually, many of them made a conscious effort to find time to read something. These days, teens are constantly hooked to their phones. They read neither newspapers nor storybooks. Instead they keep themselves busy updating their social status. Needless to say, they have limited knowledge of the world they live in.

What are the possible causes for this and what are some possible solutions?,"Safety concerns have become increasingly common among certain demographics of the society. These people feel unsafe both in public places and at homes. The fear of safety is mainly because of the increased crime rate and limited police patrolling in public places. There are several solutions which should be implemented to deal with the safety concerns of people.
Firstly, the main reason for feeling unsafe in public and at home is the increment in the crime rate over the past few years. Nowadays, the criminals are using all sorts of tactics to rob people of their hard earned money. Moreover, cyber crime has opened another channel for criminals. Another reason why people feel unsafe is the lack of adequate police force. As a result, police cannot patrol public and residential areas effectively. People naturally feel safe and secure when adequate numbers of police personnel patrol their area.
There are two effective solutions to tackle safety concerns at home and in public places. One way to improve safety is to reduce the crime rate by ensuring rehabilitation of first-time offenders. This method will ensure reintegration of criminals into the society. Another method to improve safety concerns is to recruit more police force and increase round the clock patrolling in public and residential areas. A recent study in Australia has shown that 83% of people feel naturally secure when they have some security arrangements around them.
In conclusion, reducing the crime rate and increasing patrolling are effective methods to enhance the safety of people. If the governments worked aggressively in both the areas, the society will feel much more secure.",7.5,people-feel-unsafe-in-public-and-at-home-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
750,Nowadays we are producing more and more waste. What are the causes of this? What can be done to help reduce the amount of waste?,"A significant increase has been witnessed in the amount of waste that we are producing these days. This essay will discuss how the recent surge in industrial activities has triggered this issue and how the introduction of strict regulations by governments can play an important role in reducing the amount of waste.
During the last few decades, industrial activities have increased and this has resulted in the production of higher amounts of waste. Manufacturing units and factories are operating day and night to produce goods required by industries, and at the same time they are polluting our environment with dangerous chemicals and waste materials resulting from the production activities. For instance, China faced / encountered the highest level of air pollution during the last three decades and it is exactly the same period during which the country witnessed a whopping increase in its export of locally manufactured goods.
To reduce the waste, strict regulations should be imposed by governments so that companies are encouraged to improve their waste management systems. If companies are penalized for the amount of waste produced, they will find ways to reduce their negative impact on the environment. Levying tax on polluting industries is a step in the right direction. For example, many European countries have imposed taxes on the carbon dioxide emissions and this has helped to keep the emission level in these countries at a very low level.
In conclusion, increased industrial activities are to be blamed for the higher amount of waste produced. However, governments can tackle the issue by introducing taxes and penalties on the waste material produced by manufacturing companies.

751,Shopping is now one of the most popular forms of leisure activity in many countries for young adults. Why is this? Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?,"In many countries, especially in cities, shopping has become the best way for teenagers to relax. It is because for many people it is an immediate and easy option and they do not have to plan in advance. I think this is a positive development and in this essay I will support my stand with valid arguments.
There are plenty of shopping malls in cities, which are a quick option for many people to spend their leisure time. It not only helps them to relax but also allows them to buy their necessities in their leisure time. According to a survey conducted by a magazine, 68% of young adults choose shopping as their first option whenever they feel bored or stressed out. And the survey also explained that 15% of them choose window shopping to chill out.
In my opinion, it is largely a positive development, because shopping directly generates revenue for the government in the form of tax and creates employment. If they purchase goods, 5% to 15% of the bill will go to the government. As a result the government can also provide good facilities such as proper roads and safety to citizens. That is why most of the metropolitan cities encourage shopping malls and stores to increase their revenue. For example, in Hyderabad, GHMC doubled its revenue after it permitted 50 malls, which helped to renovate 20 parks and repair all the roads in city.
In conclusion, shopping is the best way to relax as it requires hardly any planning. It also benefits the economy. However, youngsters need to take care not to spend beyond their means.",7.5,shopping-is-now-one-of-the-most-popular-forms-of-leisure-activity-for-young-adults-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
752,"Some people believe that watching TV is good and makes life more enjoyable; others, however, think it is a waste of time. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion.","Television is the main source of entertainment in many homes. Compared to a few decades ago, today almost every home has a television set. Some people think that TV brings more fun to an individual’s life, but others that believe watching TV is a waste of time.  In my opinion, watching TV is good if we can limit the amount of time spend on this activity.
On the one hand, television has evolved from what it used to be a couple of years back. Today there are numerous informative channels that children and adults can benefit from. People are updated with information from around the world through live 24 hours news channels. Channels like Discovery, BBC, and National Geographic provide information and knowledge to kids and it can be helpful for their science classes and other subjects. Secondly, television brings all family members to the living room. Today, with the help of technology, a plethora of online movie apps are present on modern televisions. For example, apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and many more bring the latest movies to home and it makes watching movies fun at home with family instead of going to movie halls which is expensive nowadays.  Therefore, television is playing a major role in making families happy and providing valuable information to kids and adults.
On the other hand, television can become a spoiler, when people do not set limit on the time spent in front of it. Individuals spend numerous hours watching TV which makes them lazy and unhealthy. For example, children spend a lot of their time watching cartoons and other movies today. They should be encouraged to engage in outdoor games so that they become healthy and not lazy.
To conclude, television can be beneficial if a person limits the amount of time spent in front of it. If too many hours are spent on viewing TV then it is wasting one’s time.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-watching-tv-is-good-and-makes-life-more-enjoyable-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
753,"Sometimes people think that young people should be encouraged to leave their family at a certain age, while others think that it is better for them to remain with their family. What is your view?","According to some people, youngsters should leave their parental home at a certain age to live an independent life. Others opine that they should live with their parents as long as they can. In my opinion, it is better for young people to live independently after a certain age.
Even though living alone is demanding, it helps the individual to develop a certain mindset and personality. When the child is faced with day to day problems especially financial ones, he will learn to cope up. If they live on their own, such situations will turn them into problem solvers and they will not run to their family for help. By contrast, if youngsters live with their parents, they will instinctively lend a helping hand when they see their children in trouble without comprehending that it is a fierce world and learning to deal with such situations is crucial for their children.
While living with parents has its own perks, it also comes with a few downsides. A parent expects a child to follow their ideas and listen to their advice. Even if, this is in their best interest, the world has changed now. For example, while growing up, we were advised to choose engineering as a field of study because it was one of the highly paid professions. These days an engineer earns peanuts compared to most of other professionals. Therefore, it might be in their best interest; still, a child must formulate his life goals based on his own experiences.
In conclusion, it is better for a child to leave their parent’s house at a certain age. It is a parent’s duty to decide and plan well in advance. Not only is this better for the mental development of the child but it also teaches them crucial life lessons.",7.5,sometimes-people-think-that-young-people-should-be-encouraged-to-leave-their-family-at-a-certain-age-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
754,"Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","There are contradictory thoughts and beliefs regarding subjects that students should learn at university. One set of people believe that students should study the subject of their choice while others believe that students should study only subjects like science and technology which will be beneficial for them in future. This essay will discuss why students should choose a subject that suits their inclination rather than studying a few popular subjects.
There are enormous job opportunities in the field of science and technology and along with that they offer fancy perks and fast growth too. Considering above things some people think that rather than studying any one subject, students should study only those subjects which have high demand and employment opportunities. For example, in the year 2017, 56 multi-national companies started their operations in different locations in India and then hired 900 software engineers on handsome salary. There is no doubt that these subjects have huge importance but other subjects are also valuable.
Students give best results when they are free to study whatever they like. It is disastrous to force students to study only a few subjects without considering their interest. For example, a student can enjoy medicine only if he wants to become a doctor. If all students learn science and technology, we will only have doctors and engineers. This will lead to many problems because the world needs professionals with a variety of skills and expertise.
This essay discussed why students should opt to study whatever they like rather than focus / focusing on a few subjects.

755,"Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles. Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some individuals contend that spare time should be spent on some healthy indoor activities such as reading and doing scrabble whereas others are inclined to the view that it is essential to rest without intentionally having any thoughts to recharge the mind. This essay will discuss both sides of this contentious argument and then I will give my own perspectives.

To begin with, reading and playing word games are effective ways for stress reduction. No matter how much stress we face in daily life, the stress may just slip away when we lose ourselves in a great story of a book or concentrate on solving the word puzzles. Reading helps to distract us from the tension we face and keeps us in the present moment.  In addition, these activities foster cognitive stimulation. Studies have shown that staying mentally active through activities such as reading and doing word puzzles preclude us from losing brain power and reduce the progress of Dementia. Just like any other muscle in our body, brain muscle needs to be exercised to stay active.

On the flip side, it is essential to not think about anything and give our mind some rest whenever we can. When we keep ourselves away from discursive thinking, it enhances our awareness and senses to engage with the surroundings without the burden to analyse every situation we observe and encounter. For instance, we always feel recharged and enter a state of peace and tranquillity when we rest our mind doing nothing especially after a busy day at work.
In conclusion, reading, solving word puzzles and keeping our mind free during leisure period bring merits to enhance the mind. Engaging in such activities is good for enhancing our creativity and cognitive skills. By contrast, resting the mind by doing nothing is a better way to beat stress.",7.5,some-people-think-that-it-is-important-to-use-leisure-time-for-activities-that-improve-mind-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
756,"An increasing number of professionals, such as doctors and teachers, are leaving their own poorer countries to work in developed countries. What problems does this cause? What can be done to deal with the situation?","A considerable / huge number of professionals like doctors and tutors are moving to developed nations. Brain drain causes numerous issues such as negligible development in the education sector and health care segment and downward economic development curve in the developing countries. I will discuss these problems in the subsequent paragraphs along with their corrective measures.
The major problem that brain drain causes is the lack of development in education and health care sectors. For instance, as the creamy layer of educators and doctors move to other nations, the scope of development in the amelioration of public hospitals and government schools become static. As a result, their mother land cannot receive the required advancement in these sectors. Another possible impact is the downward trend in the economic progress of a country. Apparently, professionals are the assets of a country who play a crucial role in the economic development. So their migration to another country causes huge economic loss.
First and foremost, the best solution to tackle this issue is to create jobs through the construction of public schools and health care centres which can generate work opportunities for these skilled workers. Apart from offering them a job, benchmarking of salaries to the international standard must be done so that they do not get attracted towards developed nations for higher packages. Moreover, to improve economic progression, authorities should make investments in existing schools and healthcare centres so that they meet global standards. If opportunities are available in their own country, young professionals will not want to leave for greener pastures.
To conclude, lack of opportunities is the main reason that encourages talented and ambitious young people to migrate to developed countries. Unfortunately, this migration hurts the development of their country and the only way to stop this is to make opportunities available for them within their own country.",7.5,an-increasing-number-of-professionals-are-leaving-their-poor-countries-to-work-in-developed-countries-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
757,"Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","It is true that languages play an important role in life. Some people argue that governments should invest money for preserving languages to avoid the loss of culture. However, I believe that spending money on saving endangered languages is unnecessary as governments should pay more attention to public services such as health care.
There is the commonly held view that governments should spend money on preventing languages from extinction so that a wide range of cultures can be protected / preserved. This is because each language usually represents one culture. For example, there are eleven types of indigenous languages in Taiwan and their mythology and ancient literature are written only in those respective languages. If these languages die out, part of their cultures will permanently vanish. However, it is widely known that the loss of minority languages does not significantly impact people’s lives as only a few people use them.
My strongly held belief is that governments should not waste money on saving endangered languages. It is evident that these languages are less valuable and less beneficial to people’s lives. Many studies show that saving a language will certainly cost a large amount of money and only a few people particularly linguistics can benefit from it and it increases the financial burden on a nation. By contrast, if governments can allocate more funds to the development of medical devices, they can certainly save many lives. Therefore, the government should focus on improving crucial sectors instead of wasting a lot of money to save local languages.
In conclusion, while it is true that saving local languages is crucial for conserving cultures associated with them, in my opinion, it is more important for the government to invest in essential services like healthcare and education. Hence, I am not in favour of spending a lot of money for saving languages.",7.5,should-governments-spend-public-money-on-saving-languages-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
758,"Many people work long hours, leaving very little time for leisure activities. Does this situation have more advantages or more disadvantages?","Nowadays, the majority of people spend longer period of time at office and allocate negligible time for their hobbies. I believe that it has more drawbacks than benefits. Although it helps a person to achieve their professional goals in the short time, eventually it will hurt their health and lead to various physical and mental ailments.
On the one hand, it inhibits the productivity of an individual at work. Due to less time spent on recreational activities, the efficiency and effectiveness is impacted negatively. It is extremely crucial to rejuvenate the mind and body to give hundred percent at office. For instance, in the multinational firms, the person should be capable of handling work pressure and maintaining the accuracy of each task simultaneously which is only attainable by involving in such activities. Furthermore, the lack of participation in leisure activities can cause psychological health problems such as Alzheimer’s. According to the Indian Medical Association, people who rarely engage in physical leisure activity have higher risk of getting stung by this disease.
On the other hand, staying late at work station helps to fulfil the professional goals and leads to career progression at a rapid pace. Workaholics are more likely to achieve their career objectives by spending major part of their day at office. For instance, as per the recent survey conducted by Harvard Business Review, people who spend an average of sixty five hours at their workplace are more likely to be rewarded with promotion.
To conclude, it is evident that career-focused individuals dedicate maximum hours at office to earn promotion, but they lack productivity and are more prone to many mental diseases.

759,"Eventually, technology will solve the most important environmental problems the world faces today.  To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Technology is growing by leaps and bounds; every day there is a new innovation that revolutionizes our way of living. There is a general notion that one day technology will help to solve all the problems related to the environment  However, in my opinion technology can only guide us or predict the future and all the precautions have to be taken by humans in order to save the environment.
The major problem faced by mankind today is the scarcity of water resources especially the water that is fit for human consumption. Technology can only help purify the water with the help of water filter and other latest technologies. However, it is we who have to use the water judiciously and conserve it in order to make it available for our coming generations. In other words technology can only assist us and ultimately the onus is on us to act.
The other prominent environmental issue nowadays is pollution. Technology is the main factor behind the increase in the level of pollution. For example, the advancement in motor vehicle technology has made it possible for each one of us to afford a car or bike, which in turn has led to sharp increase in air pollution level due to vehicular exhaust. While technology is causing the pollution humans can reduce it by limiting the use of vehicles, planting more trees and making technology more nature friendly.
To conclude, no doubt technology can help us to tackle environmental issues; however, it cannot magically solve all the problems plaguing the planet. Only humans can solve environmental issues caused by human activity.",7.5,eventually-technology-will-solve-the-most-important-environmental-problems-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
760,Some people think it’s better to choose friends who always have the same opinions as them. Other people believe it’s good to have friends who sometimes disagree with them. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Experts throughout the developing and developed world have debated whether it is better to have a friend who shares the same beliefs and thoughts as us or to have a companion who has a completely different mindset. This essay will discuss both sides after which I will provide my perspective on this controversial topic.
Those who hold the view that we should select a friend who shares the same opinion as us have their justifications. The main reason for their argument is that one can have a long lasting and harmonious relationship with someone if both of them have the same mindset. This is because there will be less conflict and fewer arguments.
In addition to this, they enjoy their time being together, make good memories and take quick decision. For instance, my relationship with each of my friends has lasted for more than a decade; this is because we hardly have any disagreement when it comes to what to eat, which movie to watch and which game to play.
Those who believe that it is better for their companions to have different beliefs and to disagree with them have their rationale. They are convinced that if they have friends with different views, they will be able to make informed decisions. This is because friends who have different perspectives will encourage us to analyse things from different angles.
In addition to this, we enhance our critical thinking abilities and increase our general knowledge. In contrast, if our friends share the same mindset as us, we will probably not be able to prevent some unfavourable outcomes of some decisions we make. Hence, a friend who disagrees with you in certain factors, in fact informs you regarding negative consequences of a step you are about to take.
In conclusion, both sides of the argument have merits. Having analysed both schools of thought, I am of the opinion that the benefits of having a partner who disagrees with us cannot be discounted especially with regard to decision making.

761,"Human activity has had a negative impact on plants and animals around the world. Some people think that this cannot be changed, while others believe actions can be taken to bring about a change. Discuss both and give your opinion.","It is an undeniable fact that humans have significantly damaged the ecological balance of flora and fauna. Although some people opine that there exist no remedies to initiate a change, I believe that it is still possible to reverse these adverse impacts on the environment. This essay will discuss the former and the latter arguments in detail.
To begin with, some people believe that nothing much can be done to reverse the damage caused to the nature. This is because the governments are not taking enough initiative to curb the overuse of fossil fuels and reduce the deforestation. For example, it was reported by International Organisation for Climate Change that the damage caused by global warming is irreversible because most of the governments have failed to act seriously. However, the government can improve the situation by amending the law and making it more stringent by including penal provisions.
However, I am of the view that that there are a lot of measures which can still be undertaken by the government and people to reverse the adverse effects. The government should make policies to reduce the consumption of plastic and fossil fuels. As a result, there will be less pollution and these measures will gradually lead to recovery of the mother-nature. To illustrate, countries like Bhutan has completely eradicated the consumption of plastic and since then there has been a significant improvement in the growth of flora and fauna. Thus, these actions can help to undo the harm caused to the environment.
To conclude, despite the fact that some people may not have any hopes in relation to the improvement of the environment due to the lack of efforts taken by the government, I believe that there are a plethora of options available such as implementing stricter polices and curbing the usage of plastic to overcome these issues.

762,The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is an irrefutable fact that shopping online has become increasingly popular these days. In this regard, there is a possibility that online shopping would lead to the closure of brick and mortar stores in cities and towns in the future. This essay will discuss the possibility of this happening.
To begin with, the vital reason for the closure of physical stores in future is that consumers are quite satisfied with the unique shopping experience provided by online sites. This is because they have wide varieties of shopping options to choose from coupled with fast and reliable delivery channels which makes most of the customers prefer e-commerce sites over traditional stores. For instance, recently, in Bengaluru many renowned stores had to shut down because of the change in shopping preferences of customers. Consequently, given the fact that e-commerce companies have entered into almost every sector, there is a high possibility that retail stores will eventually perish.
Another compelling reason that the e-commerce giants will succeed over retail shops is that they have larger capital base and lower overhead cost. These companies have enormous net worth to afford substantial marketing cost to penetrate the market despite the competition from the stores. For example, Amazon has launched plethora of drones for initiating faster delivery which would decrease the manpower cost dramatically. As a result, although these companies incur huge capital expenditure, the income generated over a period of time is multifold which makes them market leaders and thus lead to the elimination of the traditional stores.
In conclusion, it can be anticipated that e-commerce companies will acquire the entire market share in the future because they provide exceptional client service and are efficiently able to reduce the overhead expenditure.",7.5,the-growth-of-online-shopping-will-lead-to-the-closure-of-shops-in-cities-and-towns-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
763,A long prison term as a way of punishing those who break the law is not as good as other methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Awarding prison sentences has long been regarded as an effective method to fight crime. I agree with the argument / view / opinion that it can be a good approach, although we should also consider other useful correctional methods.
Imprisonment can considerably reduce crime in society, because such a punishment has deterrent effects on offenders. Being sentenced to prison means that people lose freedom they are entitled to as a law-abiding person. They are not able to keep in touch with their loved ones, including family and friends, so they tend to feel lonely and isolated in prison. Since most people cannot bear this consequence of breaking the law, they are less likely to commit crimes.
While it is true that this harsh penalty is effective at curbing crime, there are even better approaches such as community service. Unlike prison sentences, the community service can rehabilitate minor offenders by isolating them from possible negative influence that they could be exposed to in jail. Hence, drunk drivers or shop lifters will not have opportunities to befriend serious criminals. Instead, they will constantly receive education through various rehabilitation programs to realize how their behaviors have caused problems to communities, and this will encourage them to reform themselves. Another benefit of the community service sentence is that it can help many people, especially young offenders, to get reintegrated into the society.
The major reason for junior delinquency in many parts of the world is poverty, which is a result of the lack of education in these areas. Because these deprived children have not received education that teaches them how to distinguish right from wrong, they are likely to commit crimes. If they engage in lectures and events organized by governments, they can understand moral principles and improve their skills, helping them find employment when they enter society.
In conclusion, while imprisonment is a good way to control crime rates in society, community services can also work as an effective reform method.",7.5,a-long-prison-term-is-not-good-as-other-methods-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
764,Universities and colleges are now offering qualifications through distance learning from the internet rather than teachers in the classroom. Do you think the advantages of this develop outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is true that people are able to gain qualifications provided by universities and colleges via distance learning. Some people argue that people can benefit from this development and meet their learning needs. However, I believe that distance learning has more drawbacks than merits due to its lack of efficiency.
There is a commonly held view that distance learning can be beneficial for some people especially those in rural areas. This is because there are few universities or colleges in these areas due to the small population. If students can gain qualifications through distance learning, they can develop their skills, improving their employability. Another advantage of distance learning is that interested people can obtain knowledge in a variety of fields. For instance, if an Asian student wants to study how Western countries develop solar power, he/ she can easily enrol in the relevant course at an open university.
However, my strongly held opinion is that distance learning can certainly decrease the effectiveness of student learning. It is evident that students are likely to get distracted while doing a distance learning program as they might use their laptops to browse other websites which are not relevant to course contents. For example, it is widely known that learners cannot concentrate on online learning because they tend to get distracted by social media. In addition, learners cannot receive instant and constructive feedback from teachers, making the process of learning less efficient. If students are not able to focus on their learning, it is highly impossible for them to meet the requirements of qualifications.
In conclusion, although distance learning certainly enables students to acquire some academic qualifications, it is not an efficient way of learning and hence I think its disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

765,In many countries in the world people buy clothes and choose hairstyles according to latest fashion? Why is this happening? Is this a positive or a negative development?,"Worldwide people are following latest fashion and are grooming themselves accordingly. I believe easy availability of merchandise and advertising have made these revolutionary changes. It is definitely a positive trend both for the individual and the society.
To commence with, globalization and digital technology have made the way for international businesses to flourish across various nations. Top brands, trendy clothes and style which were limited to a particular country are now easily available in many countries.
People can buy them online or from stores. Moreover, advertisements have greatly influenced people to follow fashion trends. Many celebrities are made brand ambassadors and they start advertising for the products on television, newspapers and on social media. Thus, people become aware of what is trending in the market and certainly it creates an impulse in them to buy it. Perhaps, they don’t want to get bullied for doing something which is not in fashion, so they go along with the trend.
In my opinion, this is definitely beneficial for an individual because it helps in enhancing one’s personality. People who are up to date are always looked upon by their colleagues and friends, and are appreciated. This boosts their self confidence and body image. To illustrate this, studies have shown that people who are stylish and trendy are more happy and cheerful. Furthermore, due to increasing demand, there has been a tremendous growth in the business, which ultimately has increased the rate of employment. People are employed in various sections like production, marketing, packaging, sales and so on. Therefore, public is being hired for the same and this has reduced the percentage of unemployed population significantly which is good for the country’s development.
In conclusion, as new fashion is accessible to people due to globalisation they can follow it with ease. It creates employment to a large extent and also aides in boosting one’s personality and confidence, so it is indeed a positive development.

Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","According to some people it is pivotal to emphasize on the protection of animal species that are under extinction: however, others disagree. In their opinion, issues of human beings ought to be given more priority. This essay will discuss why I think that both the problems need to be treated with utmost importance.
On the one hand, some people maintain the view that attention should be given to the rising issues of animal extinction. The primary reason is that animals are an integral part of the ecosystem. When many different species of animals go extinct, the repercussions will be felt across the planet. Extinction of wildlife will disrupt the food chain and it is only a matter of time before humans find themselves in trouble. What’s more, animals also own the planet and they have the right to exist here just like us humans. Killing them for our benefits and engaging in activities that make their existence difficult is not only unethical but also dangerous.
On the other hand, problems faced by humans also need to be addressed. The truth is that a large section of humanity still lives in poverty and ill health. It is important to uplift them and a great deal of funding is essential to achieve this. Obviously, there is a limit to the amount of money governments can use for wildlife conservation.
In conclusion, every creature on earth deserves equal right to survive and it is possible only when they live in co operation with each other. Hence, I think that efforts should be made to protect all species that face the threat of extinction but it should not be at the expense of human welfare and needs.",7.5,many-people-think-that-we-have-to-focus-on-the-extinction-of-certain-animal-species-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
767,"Parents and teachers make many rules for children to encourage good behaviour and protect them from danger. However, children would benefit from fewer rules and greater freedom. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","Children are mostly bought up with a set of rules and regulations around them. Most of these rules are imposed by their parents and tutors in order to make them well behaving individual and to safeguard from any dangers. A few people believe that kids will be happy if fewer rules are imposed on them and more freedom is given. I totally agree with the argument that children deserve more freedom; however, they should be monitored and made to follow the rules that are set out for them.
On the one hand, children too undergo tension and problems. When they are granted freedom they have the opportunity to talk about their problems to their parents and teachers. For instance, today kids enjoy more freedom with their parents and they talk things openly. Since they are offered this freedom we get to know what problems they face and we can guide them on their issues. Whereas, when children do not have the freedom to express their problems with their parents they go into depression because they are worried and scared.
On the other hand, it is vital that strict rules and guidelines should be made for children. Kids are too young to understand what is good and bad. It is the responsibility of teachers and parents to ensure that kids are bought up by following the rules they have set. Moreover, making children follow rules from a young age will benefit them when they grow up because even adults are asked to follow rules such as traffic rules, and so on. So when children are trained to follow rules from a young age they will ensure that throughout their life they are good citizens by following all rules set by the government or at their workplace.
To conclude, under the guidance of parents and teachers kids have to be given their freedom. This freedom given to them can sometimes create wonders in their life by helping them find what they like doing. At the same time, they should be monitored and must be asked to strictly adhere to the rules that are set at school and home.",7.5,parents-and-teachers-make-many-rules-for-children-to-encourage-good-behaviour-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
768,"It is sometimes said that people should be encouraged to get married before they turn 30, as this is best both for the individual and for the society. Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see people entering wedlock in their thirties or forties. However, some people think that they should get married before they turn 30 because it is beneficial for themselves and the society. I totally disagree with that due to three reasons.
Firstly, young couples who rush to get married tend to have a high probability of getting a divorce. Broken families prevent children from growing up in a healthy environment. As a result, this can create social problems when children do not receive enough support from family, and they may even get involved in criminal offences outside. The taxpayers, thus, will have to waste their money dealing with these social issues instead of spending it on economic development.
Secondly, I believe that getting married at a young age can lead to serious financial problems.  Many youngsters who are in their twenties are usually people who recently graduated from the university. These people who just entered the workforce may not have enough savings, and therefore, they will struggle to financially support the family, especially if they are expecting a new born.
Finally, while it is true that women are encouraged to give birth in their twenties to prevent potential health complications to the mother and the child, I think that the current medical advancement is capable of helping older women to deliver babies safely. Hence, tying the knot early just to get pregnant early is no longer valid.
In conclusion, not only does settling down early affect the society, but it also has negative impact on the individual. Thus, I am strongly against youngsters getting married in their twenties.",7.5,it-is-sometimes-said-that-people-should-be-encouraged-to-get-married-before-they-turn-30-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
769,"Some people say cheap air travel is good because it enables ordinary people to travel, others argue that it is bad for the environment. Discuss both views, and include your opinion.","Due to the expansion of low cost airlines, more and more people can fly with cheap air tickets. Some people think that this is a positive development, but some argue that this has negative impact on the environment. In my opinion, I think that cheap flight ticket is good for two reasons.
Firstly, traveling by air used to be a luxurious method of travel; however, low cost airlines such as Air Asia and Easyjet have given the opportunity for ordinary people to travel abroad with inexpensive flight to gain more knowledge. I believe that most of the people now have equal opportunity to explore the world all because of cheap flights.
Secondly, higher inbound traffic to the country will spur the local tourism industry and eventually improve the country’s economy. Tourism makes immense contributions to the economies of countries like Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Therefore, more jobs can be created to benefit the local community when more tourists arrive.
However, some people think that busier air traffic has negative impact on the environment. This is because the rise in the number of flights will increase the amount of jet fuel burnt in the air. As a result, carbon emission and pollution will increase leading to global warming.
In conclusion, although cheap air travel can potentially accelerate global warming, I still side with those who think that it is positive to ordinary people because not only does it give everyone the opportunity to explore the world, but it also can help tourism to develop.",7.5,some-people-say-cheap-air-travel-is-good-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
770,Some psychologists say that doing absolutely nothing for a period of time each day is the key to decreasing stress in everyday life. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some psychological experts argue that in order to eliminate stress from our daily life, it is better to spend a certain amount of time without engaging in any sort of activities. However, it seems that this suggestion does not appear to be much productive due to manifold reasons.
Firstly, being idle for a period of time would probably create a state of laziness in the people. To elaborate, this practice does not significantly stimulate the body and mind. Instead of that, it leads to a more idle state. In addition, this method may become more boring for many a person, as it lacks any sort of mental or physical stimulation. For example, doing some activities like meditation increases the concentration and presence of mind; however, being idle leads to sleepiness / drowsiness. Therefore, the benefit may not be progressive as expected. What’s more, people may entertain unwanted or harmful thoughts while staying idle. In the end, this will cause more harm than good.
Secondly, there are various ways to cope with mental stress, which can deliver not only mental but also physical advantage.  Being engaged in activities like sports and games, for instance, boosts our mental health; apart from that, it helps us to stay rejuvenated throughout the day.
To conclude, it does not seem advisable that such relaxation techniques advocated by certain experts are effective for every individual in the long term, as it does not contribute significantly to deal with daily stress; actually, there are better ways to cope with stress. Hence, in my opinion, this suggestion is not likely to be productive.",7.5,some-psychologists-say-that-doing-absolutely-nothing-for-a-period-of-time-is-the-key-to-reducing-stress-in-everyday-life-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
771,The structure of families and the role of its members are changing gradually. What kind of changes are they? Do these changes have a positive effect or negative affect?,"In the modern world, families have become more independent and the part people play at home also has changed significantly. I believe this is a positive trend in terms of the quality of life.
Households are increasingly becoming less rigid as people become more independent. As the society develops, a growing number of people, especially young people who value privacy and space, have chosen to live apart from their parents and have an independent life. This allows them to make their own decisions in most cases without the interference from their parents. Meanwhile, women enjoy equality in many parts of the world today, so many of them have decided to enter the job market like their husbands to have a fulfilling career, instead of staying at home. This change in the family structure not only liberates women from their traditional gender based role but also benefits men, because when the family has more earnings, the financial burden on husbands is lessened.
I believe this is a good thing as an independent dual-income household can help people enjoy a high-quality life. When people live their own lives, it considerably reduces the family tension that often happens in an extended family. Staying away from those conflicts and arguments caused by generation gap, young people and their parents can both feel happy. What is more, as the wife also earns salaries, a family has more income sources. When people have disposable income, they will be able to spend on what they like or want. For example, they can have an exotic holiday or buy a luxury car. They are less confined to a limited budget, and this contributes a lot to the improvement in their standards of living.
In conclusion, families are changing significantly in terms of their structure and the role people play within its boundaries. This has a positive influence on households due to the fact it enables people to live a high-quality life.",7.5,the-structure-of-families-and-the-role-of-its-members-are-changing-gradually-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
772,Some people think that illegal Internet downloads are having a negative effect on the music industry. Others feel that they have little or no impact on artists. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.,"Illegal downloading of music from the internet has become a trend nowadays. Although some people believe that such activity does not affect the artists, I think that it will impact the music industry negatively.
On the one hand, it is argued that artists will not be financially affected by illegal downloads on the internet. Some people opine that they have multiple sources of income. Even though the consumers do not pay for their songs, they can still earn their money through endorsements. Therefore, it is said that as long as people continue to listen to their music by legal or illegal means, they will still be famous and able to earn their living somewhere else.
On the other hand, I believe that this will significantly affect the music sector as a whole. Firstly, in my opinion, a lot of production studios may not be sustainable if consumers do not pay for their products. Recording music incurs high production costs because it involves many professionals such as singers and composers. If they do not have enough source of income due to illegal downloading, they will not be able to survive in this competitive market in the long term. I also think that this will discourage the artists who spent hours in creating good music for their audience. They may feel that their songs are not appreciated and therefore, de-motivated to continue composing wonderful songs and quit the jobs. As a result, the music industry will become a sunset field due to lack of talents.
In conclusion, although many artists do not rely only on one source of income, I still believe that downloading music online without paying for it will cause the whole industry to slow down and production studios will not survive in the future.",7.5,some-people-think-that-illegal-internet-downloads-are-having-a-negative-impact-on-the-music-industry-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
773,Some people believe that they should keep all the money they have earned and should not pay tax to the state. Do you agree or disagree with the above notion?,"Taxes are essential for the growth of the country. A few individuals believe that the government should not deduct taxes from their earnings. I completely disagree with this notion and firmly believe that citizens are entitled to pay taxes for the betterment of the country and for an enhanced standard of living.
Firstly, it is a fact that every country runs on the taxes that are collected from their citizens. These taxes are collected for the construction of various facilities such as public transportation, medical facilities, universities, and so on. Indeed the taxes collected are used for the benefit of the public. For example, in countries like Canada and Australia, the citizens enjoy medical and primary education facilities for free, and this is possible only because their people contribute to the government in the form of taxes.
Secondly, in some countries paying taxes is a way of saving for the retirement. The people of these countries enjoy retirement benefits from the government when they are aged. People hardly find well-paid jobs when they are above 60 and might earn only minimum wages; therefore, in such a situation, the pension that the government pays will be helpful. For example, in countries like Canada and Australia, the government provides retirement benefits to their citizens since they had paid taxes when they were working.
To conclude, taxes are resources for the government to build the country and to ensure that their citizens have a good standard of living. People also require facilities like hospitals, universities and robust transportation systems and to build them the government needs money and taxes are the primary source of income for the government.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-they-should-keep-all-the-money-they-have-earned-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
774,Some people think that books should be stopped in school and that videos films and computers should be used instead. To what extent do you agree?,"In this technological era, technology has penetrated every aspect of our lives including the way we teach and learn. However, some people have gone further and think that books should be abandoned completely in the learning process and they should replaced with computers and other media forms. Personally, I do not agree with this opinion as learning from books has countless advantages.
To begin with, it is undeniable that the using of computers and other media forms in the classroom would enrich the teaching process and make it more interactive and fun. For example, computers can be used for writing assignments and other classroom activities which are interactive and easy to correct by teachers. In addition, computers provide a visual representation of information and make it easy for students to learn and remember it. Therefore, it is understandable why many people believe that books should be replaced with videos, films and computers.
Nevertheless, computers should never replace books as it has been proven that they have several benefits. Firstly, learning from books improves cognitive abilities and develop the imagination rapidly which is vital especially in early school years. Secondly, only by using books children can learn handwriting which is an essential part of learning and crucial for strengthening small hand muscles that are used in complicated and precise tasks later on in life.
In conclusion, it is true that the usage of computers and other means of media is necessary in schools nowadays. However, the existence of books is also vital. Thus, it is hoped that schools around the world embrace the approach of using both of them in their classrooms.",7.5,some-people-think-that-books-should-be-stopped-in-school-and-that-video-films-and-computers-should-be-used-instead-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
775,Some say that it would be better if the majority of employees work from home instead of travelling to a workplace every day. Do you think the advantages of working from home outweigh disadvantages?,"Working and earning an income is essential for the survival of all people. However, travelling every day to the work place is tiring as well as time consuming. Some people believe that telecommuting is better for most workers as it has several benefits. In my opinion, work from home brings numerous professional and personal benefits which outweigh its drawbacks.
On the one hand, commuting consumes considerable time every day. In the modern world, every employee demands higher productivity in which every second counts. Therefore, telecommuting helps an employee to save time in terms of travelling. That extra time could be converted into productive work, especially in urban areas where traffic congestion is high and leads to time loss. For instance, the average commuting time for an employee in a metropolitan city like Mumbai, India is two hours. Had the employers allowed their workers to work from home, it would have increased their productivity by 20 percent since two hours of commute is considerably long for an 8-hour job in a day.
On the other hand, lack of face to face interaction at office would reduce professional development of an employee. Improving communication skills and other soft skills is crucial for career development and this is not possible when employees telecommute. Additionally, it is impossible to telecommute for people who work in manufacturing sector because their work needs to be monitored continuously. However, some professionals, like those in the Information technology sector, could enjoy the benefits offered by telecommuting since most of their project could be done from a remote location.
In conclusion, although telecommuting has some drawbacks, I believe that the additional time and flexibility offered by it is extremely beneficial for employees of certain job sectors. Despite the fact that telecommuting negatively affects the rapid professional development of an individual, it increases the productivity which employers enjoy the most.",7.5,some-say-that-it-would-be-better-if-the-majority-of-employees-work-from-home-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
776,People living in the 21st century generally have better quality of lives than people born in earlier centuries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is an undeniable fact that the world has been advancing rapidly since the beginning of this century. Therefore, many people opine that today our living standards are much better than those of our ancestors. This essay concurs with this statement as it has manifold reasons to substantiate it.
To embark on, people were more susceptible to different kinds of diseases in those days and casualties were high. The revolutionary development of medical science contributed to averting such threats to a great extent. For example, the fatality rate of infectious viral diseases such as measles and polio were significantly higher in the previous century; however, nowadays these are completely eradicated from the planet. While newer diseases continue to emerge from time to time, modern medicine is able to cure many of them.
In addition, the transportation facilities available these days are more versatile. They have reduced the travelling time to a great extent as well as improved the connectivity between various destinations. Likewise, home appliances have made cooking and cleaning easier. Apart from that, the role of recent communication channels remarkably contributed to making our life more comfortable. The internet which enables us to send and receive a huge amount of data within seconds can be considered as the finest example of the power of technology. Thus, obviously, our lives are easier and more comfortable today than in the past.
In short, the people who live in the present century are enjoying the benefits of better services in the health, transport and communication sectors. Therefore, I believe, we enjoy a better quality of life than our ancestors.",7.5,people-living-in-the-21st-century-have-better-quality-of-life-than-people-born-in-earlier-centuries-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
777,Many people find it hard to balance their work with other parts of their lives. What are the reasons for this? How can this problem be overcome?,"One of the most challenging aspects of the 21st century is the difficulty in keeping balance between work and life. Most of the population is struggling to maintain a successful and comfortable environment in their workplace and at the same time spend quality time with the family. There several reasons which lead to this unbalanced life.
Firstly, in this competitive business environment, it is extremely difficult to survive if we are less ambitious and hence we spend more time at the workplace. Especially due to reforms in the education sector, more people are able to attend universities and the percentage of students who graduate with high grades and good educational qualifications is also increasing day by day. This itself creates a threat to the existing employees because employers have the option of replacing poorly performing employees with better qualified fresh graduates and post graduates. In order to ensure their job security employees are forced to spend more time at the workplace, this in turn deducts the time they get to spend with their family. Secondly, people are more attracted to material comforts and in order to satisfy these cravings / these wants, they are keen to work hard and earn more money. Spending overtime at the workplace will help them to earn more money as they earn overtime allowances apart from their regular salary.
Unfortunately, this inability to balance life and work has become a serious cause various mental and physical health problems and conflicts in the family life. In order to tackle this, people should limit the work hours and spend the rest of their time with the family. The government can also take various steps such as conducting awareness campaigns about the risks of overtime work hours and the problems faced by the children of working parents. A strict law should be imposed in order to limit the working hours.
In conclusion, keeping a balance between work and personal life is becoming a major challenge in this competitive society. Everyone should start to think of the value of our personal life and keep a balance between their quest for money and contentment in personal life.",7.5,many-people-find-it-hard-to-balance-their-work-with-other-parts-of-their-lives-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
778,It is becoming increasingly popular to have a year off between finishing school and going to university. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?,"More and more students are taking a year off after completing school and before going to university. This can help them to prepare for university studies in advance but there are drawbacks to be taken into account.
On the one hand, taking time off after finishing school can help students to prepare for university entrance exams. In other words, students can prepare for competitive exams to get admission in top universities. For instance, it is very common in India for students to take one year off after higher secondary to prepare for entrance exams of elite universities. Another benefit of this is that students can prepare for their university course in advance. As a result, the students will get an extra edge when they do / pursue graduation. Ultimately, their academic grades will be better which will help them to get a good job.
On the other hand, there are several drawbacks to having a year off. One of them is the wastage of time. If a student loses focus while preparing for university entrance exam or courses, he will waste his whole year. Moreover, a lot of employers prefer to have candidates without any gap in education or work experience. Therefore, people with a gap year find it difficult to get a job as they have to justify their gap time to the potential employers.
In conclusion, while there are advantages to having a gap year between competing school and entering university, its drawbacks  like wastage of time and fewer job opportunities after graduation cannot be ignored.",7.5,it-is-becoming-increasingly-popular-to-have-a-year-off-between-finishing-school-and-going-to-university-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
779,Some companies have uniforms for their staff which must be worn at all times. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages and give your own opinion.,"Wearing uniform in the workplace is mandatory for the employees of a few organisations. This trend of uniform has both the merits and demerits; however, I believe that this is overall a positive development.
The obligation to wear uniform everyday can reduce the productivity of an employee. This means, some workers do not want to wear the uniform that their companies require them to wear as the uniform might not suit their body shape. Therefore they might feel uneasy at work which in turn can hamper their performance at work. Additionally, seeing everyone in the same color or dress everyday can make a company’s working atmosphere dull and boring. People may not feel energetic in such a monotonous space which can certainly affect the overall efficiency of an establishment. However, these drawbacks associated with the wearing of uniform can be reduced to a great extent by allowing the employees to choose the uniform they want to wear.
On the other hand, one of many advantages of wearing uniform is that it can save the money and time of employees. This is because they do not need to waste their time while choosing a different dress for their workplaces everyday and also they can save a huge amount of money by not purchasing too many items of clothing. Moreover, a uniform can promote the brand name and it can make the company widely known amongst the general public. The increased brand recognition will certainly boost the sales and revenue.
In conclusion, although wearing the same uniform can be boring for employees, I believe that the time and cost savings associated with the uniform and the brand recognition it brings outweigh the drawbacks.",7.5,some-companies-have-uniforms-for-their-staff-which-must-be-worn-at-all-times-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
780,"Some people say that now we can see films on our phones or tablets and there is no need to go to the cinema. Others say that to be fully enjoyed, films need to be seen in a cinema. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Many people say that movies can now be seen on various smart devices without having to go to the cinema theatre; however, others still support going to the cinema in order to fully enjoy the movie. I strongly believe that nothing can beat the thrill of watching a movie in a cinema.
On the one hand, countless people are finding themselves watching films on their smart phones and tablets as it is more convenient. Furthermore, watching a movie on a mobile device is a lot less expensive than going to the theatre. For instance, the availability of entertainment websites like Netflix and Amazon Prime enables movie lovers to see their favourite movies at any time and at any place.
On the other hand, none of the aforementioned benefits of watching a movie on a phone or tablet can replace the joy of watching it in a cinema. This is because only when a movie is watched in a cinema, the audience can enjoy its visual and sound effects in its entirety. Furthermore, the lack of distractions in a theatre makes the movie experience much more joyful. For example, according to a survey 80% of movie lovers prefer watching a night show in the cinema to staying indoors and watching it on their television or laptop.
For all of the above mentioned reasons, I strongly support the statement that seeing your favourite movie on the big screen in a cinema is more thrilling than watching it on tiny handheld screens.
To conclude, watching a movie on a small device is certainly more convenient and cost effective; however, watching it on the big screen in a cinema is an altogether different and a whole lot more enjoyable experience. It is up to the movie lover to decide what suits them the best.",7.5,some-people-say-that-now-we-can-see-films-on-our-phones-or-tablets-and-there-is-no-need-to-go-to-the-cinema-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
781,Some people believe that nowadays we have too many choices. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is argued by some people that we have a lot more options to choose now than we used to have in the past. This essay completely agrees with the statement because thousands of products are displayed in shops at present and many people think it is difficult to select one from the multiple options.
Nowadays, we can find huge shopping malls which stock various products from many different brands and this sometimes makes it difficult for people to pick an item because there are so many options. For instance, about twenty years ago, when people wanted to buy clothes or electronic appliances there were not many options. As a result, they bought whatever was available to them and still they were happy. But today, the consumer is spoilt for choice when they enter a supermarket and as such they have to think many times before zeroing in on a particular product. Worse still, inspite of spending a lot of time comparing the options, they are not satisfied with the purchase because they suspect that the other options could have been better.
Choices are available in almost every area of life. For example, nowadays, there are plenty of options for higher studies and students and their parents often struggle to figure out what the right choice is. Even in the case of insurance and medical treatment choices are available in plenty. While the availability of choices is certainly good, the main disadvantage is that it makes the process of choosing difficult.

782,Successful companies use advertising to make more sales. What can make an advertisement very effective? Do you think this is a bad thing or a good thing for the society?,"Advertisement is used as a key to increase the sales made by many popular firms worldwide. In my opinion, these companies can make their adverts fruitful by leveraging celebrities as their brand ambassador. However, advertising impacts people negatively by making them get in to debt.
Powerful adverts can be made by hiring famous personalities to endorse the product. This is to say that, advertisements starring celebrities such as cinema artists or sports persons can easily reach general public. This is because people know them very well and tend to buy the products advertised by them. Another method of making effective advertising is creating adverts based on real life incidents or stories. For example, the popular Indian brand Amul often makes adverts inspired by sensational current events and thus manages to grab enough eyeballs.
However, advertising has a negative impact on the society as it encourages people to buy more products even if they are not in need of those items. Consequently, people tend to obtain more personal loans and stay in debt for life. For instance, the advertisement of sports cars tempts younger generation to buy them even if they cannot afford them. This will land them in serious financial difficulties. Moreover, it is annoying to watch repetitive advertisements while we watch our favorite program on television.
In conclusion, many giant companies increase their sales by advertising. They can make it more effective by using popular figures as their brand model and by making adverts based on real life incidents. Still, advertising is considered as disadvantageous as it makes people bound to debt and disturbs people when they watch some important program.",7.5,successful-companies-use-advertising-to-make-more-sales-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-2

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"It is said that art is something that is inseparable from our lives. While some believe that only talented people can create art, I agree with those who feel that everyone has the ability to do so.
On the one hand, some people think that creation of art is only possible for people who possess special skills. They argue that only these people can be successful. For instance, human history only recorded the achievements of those artists who were famous in their field, such as Mozart in the music industry. Furthermore, it is sometimes claimed that not every human can survive in such competitive sector. For example, someone may be interested in acting but they cannot become a successful actor unless they are extremely good at acting.
On the other hand, I hold the opinion that creation of art does not require special skills. I think that such talent can be acquired through practice. Playing piano, for example, needs passion and long hours of practice in order to play the music without error. I wholeheartedly believe that all of us can become a professional pianist as long as we are passionate about it. Moreover, I think that everyone has the ability to create art although there is a difference between a good one and a bad one. It is undeniable that some movies are not as popular as some other blockbusters; however, these are still masterpieces regardless of the quality.
In conclusion, even though usually talented people are more likely to survive in the industry, everyone can still be a professional artist as long as they put in enough effort. Therefore, on balance, I believe that creation of art is not limited to any particular individual.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-every-human-can-create-art-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

Others think there are more effective ways to do this. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"While many people believe that a day without cars across the world is a helpful way to increase the air quality, others are of the opinion that we should adopt other ways to preserve our environment and reduce air pollution. In this essay, I will delve into both views and provide my support for the latter view.
It is evident that actions which reduce the consumption of fossil fuels is good for the environment. Nowadays, a large number of people are ready to get back to nature and start caring about our planet more. I believe that actions like “a day-off from cars” will bring results, because people have already achieved positive outcomes with a similar initiative called “Earth Hour” during which people turn off electric lights for an hour in order to show their commitment to protect Mother Earth. People are getting more and more informed about the negative impact of air pollution on their health and the health of future generations.
Despite knowing that this initiative / idea can be helpful, I think it is not enough and preventive measures should be taken more comprehensively involving government support. It has to fund scientific research into eco-friendly products and inventions.  For example, Europe is already noticing the beneficial effects on the environment after the invention of electric cars. Although these vehicles are more expensive than petrol cars, people are buying them to protect our environment, especially air, from pollution.
To conclude, I believe that an international car-free day can be helpful for our planet and help people aware of the need to protect it. Even so, in my opinion, a better option is to invest in eco-friendly cars that do not consume petrol.",7.5,some-people-think-an-international-car-free-day-is-an-effective-way-to-reduce-air-pollution-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
785,"Films and games can be accessed at anytime from mobile devices, like smart phones, tablets and laptop computers. Do the advantages of such developments outweigh the disadvantages?","Owing to recent technological advancements, people can access entertainment programmes on their mobile devices at any time convenient to them. In my opinion, the detrimental effects these inventions can have on our behavior and family life outweigh any benefits they might bring.
Admittedly, the only benefit of using portable mobile phones and computers for watching our favorite content is that they are cost effective. With a one-time investment in these devices, we can eliminate the additional costs of buying movie tickets and video games each time we want to access them for higher prices, provided we have strong internet connection. For instance, the popularity of applications such as Netflix and Amazon Prime are at their peak, as they help in downloading programs, watching latest movies and playing games.
Nevertheless, despite the above advantage, I believe that there are some extremely serious issues associated with the usage of these devices/ equipments for entertainment. One such potentially dangerous problem is that it ruins morality. In other words, such devices jeopardize the character of individuals, especially of children, by provoking them to watch inappropriate movies and videos, which ultimately lead children to indulge in anti-social activities, including cybercrimes.
Another negative impact is that these gadgets conspicuously ruin family relationships. When there are more platforms for watching our favorite channels, we tend to spend less time with family members and this gradually paves the way for conflicts, dissatisfaction and disappointments among the members. That is why the number of teenagers attempting suicide and leaving home is rising. They lack emotional bonding with their parents and also lack the emotional maturity to deal with setbacks.
In conclusion, I strongly reckon that any development which would disturb the stability of our mind and relationships should not be encouraged, even if they provide some financial benefits.",7.5,films-and-games-can-be-accessed-at-anytime-from-mobile-devices-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

815,Small businesses should avoid recruiting young women who do not have their own family in order to avoid paying maternity leave later on. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"According to some people, small businesses should not hire young women who are yet to have babies so as to prevent them from claiming maternity leave in future. I firmly disagree. This is unfair to young women who want to be independent and is against the concept of equal opportunity for all.
A good reason to disagree with the idea of not recruiting young women is that it is against the fundamental principle of equality. People regardless of their gender and family background ought to have equal employment opportunities. Gender biases in the recruiting process will push the society backward. One of the reasons that prevent women from starting a family is financial liabilities. They need a job to be able to stand on their own feet and provide for their kids. By choosing not to hire childless young women, employers are denying them the opportunity to earn and become independent.
Not hiring young women will be a great loss to the company.  Many independent, talented young women, particularly in big cities, prefer to live alone and focus on their careers. However, at some point in their lives they want to start a family and later continue following their passion for work. Refusing to hire these talented, focused women would be a huge loss for the business.
In conclusion, I disagree with the idea of not employing young women just because they do not have their own family and might need maternity benefits later on.",7.5,small-businesses-should-avoid-recruiting-young-women-who-do-not-have-their-own-family-in-order-to-avoid-paying-maternity-leave-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
816,"Films and games can be accessed at any time from mobile devices, likes smart phones, tablets and laptop computers. Do the advantages of such developments outweigh the disadvantages?","People use portable mobile devices and laptop computers to watch and play films and games at any time of the day. In my opinion, there are more drawbacks than advantages to having constant access to movies and video games.
Admittedly, there are some basic advantages to using mobile devices and laptop computers anytime for entertainment. One of the minor advantages is that people can entertain themselves whenever they want. For example, people watch movies and play games while travelling on a bus or aeroplane. This helps people to stay engaged even when they have fewer options for other sources of entertainment. Another small benefit could be not having a feeling of loneliness. People who stay alone and who do not have many activities to do could potentially avoid the state of loneliness by using electronic devices for entertainment.
Despite the minor advantages written above, in my opinion, the uncontrolled use of electronic devices for entertainment has significant drawbacks. One of the significant problems is that many people, especially youngsters, get addicted to it. Young people keep themselves occupied with video games and movies in most of their free time. They do not have time for even physical activity and this affects their health adversely.
Another major issue to consider is the lack of discipline in people to control and stop electronic entertainment, specifically for resting time. For instance, people use their devices to entertain themselves even at late night, which affects their sleep.  Not sleeping well for a long time potentially creates health issues.
In conclusion, drawbacks of having unrestricted access to entertainment using portable devices far outweighs any of the minor advantages it brings for people.",7.5,films-and-games-can-be-accessed-at-any-time-from-mobile-devices-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
817,The average standard of people’s health is likely to be lower in the future than it is now. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Health is one of the most important aspects of human life. It is said that in the future, the average standard of health of individuals will deteriorate. I agree with this view. I believe that people will be dealing with decreased health because of the increasing popularity of fast foods and growing amount of stress that each person is facing in his/her everyday life.
To begin with, consuming fast foods on a daily basis contributes seriously to the decline of an individual’s health status. This is evident even in youngsters at present. For instance, the availability of fast food chains all over the country makes it very convenient for everyone to access these foods and encourage them to consume it on a daily basis. The result is people are prone to diseases related to cardiovascular disorders because of the high salt and high sugar content found in these fast food products.
In addition, stress related disorders are also becoming more common nowadays. Everyone is complaining of being subjected to stress daily.  Individuals who continually experience stress in their environment are likely to develop both mental and physical disorders. For example, employees who are overworked tend to develop headaches and stomach issues.
To sum up, I agree with the argument that the average health standard of an individual will decrease in the future. Whilst some are becoming aware of the health issues that are emerging at present, the growing consumption of fast foods and the constant exposure to stress will likely contribute to the decline of the average standard of health of many people in the coming years.",7.5,average-standard-of-peoples-health-is-likely-to-be-lower-in-the-future-than-it-is-now-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
818,Some organizations and companies say older people are better as leaders while some say young people are better as leader. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The managers and the chairmen of most of the institutions and organizations are older adults. It is generally argued that youngsters could manage these positions better than older people. However, I do not agree with this argument because of three different reasons.
Firstly, it is obvious that youths are less experienced and have least exposure to the world and the organization. With hardly any experience they will not be able to lead the organization to reach its vision and this could probably result in the closure of the company. For example, when young and inexperienced people start a company, they may taste some success initially. But as the business grows, their lack of experience may lead to problems and the company could shut down.  Therefore, it is evident that older people can do better than younger ones.
Secondly, it is a matter of fact that the youngsters are energetic, talented and judgmental. They not only make quick decisions but also end up investing in some unrelated stuffs without thinking. This is not the case with elders. They think numerous times before they make any decisions. For instance, my grandfather takes at least one day to decide anything related to the family. This behavior not only aids him to make the best decisions but also teaches his kids about the importance of patience. Hence, it is proved that elders make better decisions and help in the success of the company.
Finally, it is widely accepted that youth today are easily attracted towards the outside worldly life. If this is their mindset, then it is not beneficial for the progress of the company. For example, a negative comment on Facebook or Instagram may enrage a young proprietor and their thoughtless response could lead to many problems for the company.
This kind of attitude not only ruins the person but also their business. Therefore, seniors who have sound knowledge on everything should be on top position to guide others and this will lead to the success of the organization. To conclude, it is clearly evident that if seniors were in top levels of an organization then the company would reach its vision.",7.5,some-organizations-and-companies-say-older-people-are-better-as-leaders-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
819,"Discipline is an ever increasing problem in modern schools. Some people think that discipline should be the responsibility of teachers, while others think that this is the role of parents.","Discipline makes children always punctual, obedient and also well mannered. Because of these reasons discipline is an integral part of our lives. Some people think teachers are responsible for disciplining children while others think it is the duty of parents. In my opinion, both parents and teachers are responsible for teaching discipline to students.
To begin with, it is said that home is the first school of children and family members are the first mentors, because children spend the first four or five years of their life at home with family especially their parents. At this stage of life, it is the responsibility of parents to make them understand the importance of discipline in life and also create a routine for them. For example, parents should set a time for them to wake up and play and when they join school they should make a time table for their studies. To illustrate, a survey conducted among the teachers of various schools concluded that children who are already trained by parents to be disciplined are easy to handle and also it is very easy to make them understand about school’s rules and regulations. I believe the involvement of parents in making the child disciplined is crucial and after the child starts school teachers have an equally important role to play.
Teachers take care of the children at school and as such their duty is not limited to teaching science and maths. They monitor the kids at school and have a responsibility to discipline them whenever they cross the limits. They have the authority to punish kids when they misbehave or indulge in activities that are harmful to themselves or others. If teachers ignore this responsibility and focus only on giving academic lessons, they are doing a serious disservice to their students and the nation.
In conclusion, parents and teachers have equal contributions in making children well disciplined and also ensuring their success in life.",7.5,discipline-is-an-ever-increasing-problem-in-modern-schools-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
820,"Economic growth is the only way to end world poverty. However, some people say it leads to environment damage and should be stopped. To what extent do you agree?","Some people say that economic growth can eradicate poverty. Others opine that economic development causes environmental damage and hence it should be discouraged. In my opinion, environmental protection is of paramount importance and hence economic growth should be restricted.
A good reason to stop economic growth is to protect the environment from getting polluted by its harmful by-products. In other words, economic growth needs the establishment of many factories which emit obnoxious gases into the atmosphere and discharge other pollutants into the soil and water. If untreated, these by-products cause huge environmental complications. For instance, the demand for electricity rises due to high economic growth; the majority of power plants in the world use fossil fuels to produce electricity and thus cause considerable damage to the environment.
Another critical reason to protect the environment and discourage economic growth is the lack of any substantial evidence to prove that economic growth eradicates poverty. To put it in another way, billions of people are still living under poverty even after many decades of economic development, casting doubt on the role of economic growth in removing poverty. For example, years of economic growth has made rich people richer and poor people are still struggling for the basic necessities of life. Moreover, with the advancement of technologies less manual work is required in factories and hence fewer job opportunities are available although economy is developing. Obviously, economic growth chiefly benefits the affluent and does hardly anything for the poorest sections of the society.
In conclusion, sacrificing the environment for the sake of economic development is not a wise step, especially, when it is doubtful whether economic development can eradicate poverty.",7.5,economic-growth-is-the-only-way-to-end-world-poverty-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
821,The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life. To what extent do you agree?,"The idea of staying in the same job till retirement is changing. Many people try to build their professional life in multiple fields over the course of years. This requires hard work and passion to keep learning new things. Needless to say many middle aged people and even seniors are enrolling in various courses to acquire new skills.  In my opinion, rather than a fashion, switching jobss has become a necessity in many sectors because of the lack of job security.
To begin with, a few industries are rapidly changing in nature and individuals working in those get outdated sooner than expected and forced to look for other career choices. Technology, being one such field, is rapidly evolving every day. It registered huge growth in the last decade and a plethora of new technologies like artificial intelligence and internet of things are emerging now threatening existing jobs. People often find it challenging to keep them updated in such a dynamic industry and look to change their career after a short stint. For instance, 10 years ago, programmers used only a handful of languages to code their programs but today there are more than 100 languages that technologists use and learning everything is next to impossible. This forces people to learn new skills on the job and those who fail to do so have to switch careers.
Ambition also encourages many people to change jobs frequently. Thanks to greater exposure to the world outside, people are now keen to pursue their passion and take the road less traveled. For example, nowadays, it is not uncommon for a doctor to give up his medical profession become a photographer or a vlogger at 40. People want to live their life to the fullest and discover their talents. The rising cost of living also encourages them to do multiple jobs.
To sum up, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that having multiple jobs is the norm of the day. People are switching jobs frequently for various reasons including the lack of job security, rising cost of living and the need to pursue their passion.",7.5,the-idea-of-having-a-single-career-is-becoming-old-fashioned-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
822,Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their own countries. What are the reasons?  What are the solutions to change negative attitudes?,"It is commonly believed by a significant number of people that foreign tourists have a negative impact on their countries. There are several reasons for this negative attitude towards international travellers. This essay will first highlight price inflation and influence on local culture as the root causes of the aforementioned issue and then it will discuss certain measures that could be taken to handle the situation.
To begin with, international tourism adversely affects the prices of basic goods and services in an economy. Needless to say, whether it is for a business or leisure purpose, foreign visitors tend to spend a significant amount of money during their visit, and such transactions occur in foreign currencies which are higher in value when compared to the local currency. As a result, the local service providers charge higher for their goods and services. While this price inflation barely affects the foreigner, it hurts the local resident. For instance, according to some estimates, local food and lodging costs in Thailand increased dramatically in the last three decades. The same problem exists in almost all tourist places.
Similarly, multi-cultural visitors from different countries impact the local culture negatively. Foreign travellers tend to show disrespect towards traditional customs of the host country. As an illustration, in Malaysia, tourists consume alcohol in public and wear certain clothes which expose their bodies; consequently, local people get influenced and adopt similar practices. If tourists had respected norms and traditions of the host society, local values would not have been affected negatively.
However, aforementioned issues may be resolved by adopting certain proactive measures. Firstly, governments should design certain policies to control the price of local services regardless of foreign visitor’s spending. Likewise, airport management, in collaboration with local authorities, should run cultural awareness campaigns for non-native visitors.
To conclude, the inhospitable perception that the local people have of the international tourists can be explained in many ways. In my opinion, it is essential for the governments of hosting countries to change such negative attitude by controlling price hikes and making overseas visitors aware of local values.",7.5,many-people-believe-that-international-tourism-is-a-bad-thing-for-their-own-countries-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
823,Some people say that the education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is true that education plays a vital role in ensuring the prosperity of a nation. While some people believe that merely educating the masses can lead a country towards success, others argue that several other factors are equally important. I completely agree with the former statement and this essay will highlight how education propels a country towards economic and social progression.
First and foremost, educational institutions produce professionals, so that they may contribute to the betterment of the economy. For example, in Japan, from a plumber to a nuclear scientist one cannot work as a professional unless one undergoes the required practical training and obtains the mandatory certificate, degree or diploma from the concerned academic body. This practice helps educators and economists to work together and form beneficial economic policies since the entire data related to a worker’s roles and responsibilities, compensation and benefits, career progression and the like is available to them.
Secondly, a proper education system promotes high moral values which contribute positively to the development of a society. In addition, educated people are more aware of their rights and responsibilities and this enables to work together for the welfare of their nation. Education also helps eradicate corruption. It makes people aware that good governance is their right and then they will not want to pay bribes for getting things done. Educated people also tend to be healthier because they know what is good and bad for their health.
In conclusion, although there may be several factors that affect a country’s well-being, in my opinion, the education system is the cornerstone of economic and social progress.",7.5,some-people-say-that-the-education-system-is-the-only-critical-factor-in-the-development-of-a-country-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
824,"Some people think that the teenage years are the happiest time of most people’s lives. Others think that adult life brings more happiness, in spite of greater responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","According to some people, happiness peaks during adolescence while for others this occurs during adulthood despite all the challenges posed by it. Both views will be discussed in this essay before drawing a conclusion.
The transitional stage from childhood to adulthood is often considered to be the happiest.  Adolescents have no adult-type responsibilities apart from their daily routine of sleeping, eating, studying and enjoying.  Teenage is the time for experimentation and most children at this age self-discover how creative and talented they can be.  For instance, interviews of many famous artists revealed that they uncovered their skills between the ages 13 and 18, and those were the happiest days of their life since they performed for pleasure only.
In contrast, entering adult life means you survived adolescence.  For these people, happiness is defined by a successful career and a well-paid stable job.  At this age, people have attained physical and mental maturity.  Adults are free to make their own decisions and live their life as they desire.  Moreover, life becomes complete after marriage since you have a partner to share all your happiness. Sixty percent of the participants in a survey conducted by The Guardian said that their happiness was at its peak during their adulthood despite all job challenges and family responsibilities.
To conclude, happiness is defined in many different ways. Being able to lead a carefree life is what makes teenagers happy whereas for adults it is their achievements. I personally believe that the happiness curve fluctuates for each individual and cannot be attributed to any specific age.",7.5,some-people-think-that-teenage-years-are-the-happiest-time-of-life-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
825,"Nowadays online education has become popular as more institutes and companies are offering courses online. However, many people prefer the traditional, classroom training or study. Discuss the advantage and disadvantage of both methods.","It is often debated whether a student should enrol in a classroom programme or prefer online classes. In this essay, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both regular and online courses.
Working people benefit the most from online courses because they help them to acquire additional skills/qualifications without quitting their jobs.  With the advent of technology every day a new application is developed; hence to be at the top of the game, many workers enrol themselves in online courses to have a successful career. In addition, it gives them the freedom to study at flexible hours and at their own pace. The downside of doing an online course is that students have no one to monitor their progress or clear their doubts. Consequently, they may lose focus on their studies.
In a classroom, teachers have a structured course to teach pupil. They have years of experience and knowledge, which they gathered over the years.  Sometimes, when a person studies alone, they seem to lose interest in studies. However, it is observed that classroom oriented courses always push students to stay focused. Conversely, students who attend a classroom programme do not have the opportunity to attend the same lecture over and over again. However, online classes are pre-recorded and a student can watch them any number of times to grasp the lessons.
To conclude, I would like to say that both the online and traditional method of teaching have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is up to the user to decide what is appropriate for them.",7.5,nowadays-online-education-has-become-popular-as-more-institutes-and-companies-are-offering-courses-online-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
826,"In some countries, governments are encouraging industries and businesses to move to regional areas outside the big cities. Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?","Constant migration toward the big cities has become a common phenomenon all over the world. To prevent this, national authorities are encouraging/instigating industries and businesses to move to the suburbs. Although, this trend has minor drawbacks, the positive outcomes certainly overweigh them.
To start with, the development of metropolitan cities and the opportunities available there has attracted a large number of people from rural areas. Unfortunately, this migration of rural people into urban areas has created problems like traffic congestion and lack of basic facilities in cities. Encouraging people to move back to their native places is the only solution to this problem and the only way to achieve this is to create job opportunities in the countryside. Hence, governments are encouraging industries to set up their offices and factories in the rural areas.
This trend will shoot up employment and career opportunities in less competitive markets and at the same time it can address the problems of housing and overcrowding in cities. Since people don’t have to move or travel far for job, the road traffic will come down automatically. This will reduce pollution and improve air quality in metropolises. In addition to this, flourishment of development in country side will equal economic growth of all the areas. In the end, country will progress as a whole.
However, there is a downside to the industrialization of villages. It will cause air and water pollution there. However, in my opinion this problem can be solved to a great extent by ensuring proper waste management. Some people are also worried that urbanization will destroy the local culture. Nevertheless, these are small prices to pay for development.
In a nutshell, in spite of a few drawbacks, the idea of starting new ventures in non-urban areas can be a great solution to stop the human migration and bring equal prosperity and growth in all parts of the nation.",7.5,in-some-countries-governments-are-encouraging-industries-and-businesses-to-move-to-regional-areas-outside-the-big-cities-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
827,An increasing trend nowadays is for young adults to play computer games. Some people say this is a negative development. Discuss and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, more youngsters are engaged in online gaming than before. Many people assert that this has a negative impact on the gamer who wastes precious time and resources for this indulgence. However, I do not completely agree with this notion and believe that there are some positive aspects to gaming if it is done within limits. The main reason why people think computer games are bad is that they are addictive. Also, these games waste a lot of time.
Instead of focusing on their careers and other important aspects of their young life, many get diverted and find themselves enslaved by their consoles. Sometimes these games pamper the ego of the gamer. Young people who lack a sense of achievement are also more likely to play these games because reaching higher levels enable them to feel better about themselves and their capabilities. Unfortunately, this kind of behaviour certainly does not help and they end up wasting invaluable hours in the virtual world, making them fall behind their peers in the real world.
On the other hand, some benefits can be achieved by playing computer games. Firstly, it improves the reflexes and the strategic thinking capabilities of the user. Skills like eye-hand coordination, resource planning and team play can be improved by playing games and these skills come handy in life. In addition, gaming if taken seriously can be a viable career option and skilled gamers can be employed by multinational companies as testers and they can also win online gaming tournaments. Many professional gamers earn a handsome living by participating in international tournaments around the globe. Thus, if done sensibly and thoughtfully gaming could very well be a lucrative career option.

To conclude, the growing popularity of gaming among young adults is a matter of concern because it may have serious consequences when it becomes an obsession. Youngsters need to understand that they have a life and career outside of the virtual need and limit the amount of time spend playing games.",7.5,an-increasing-trend-nowadays-is-for-young-adults-to-play-computer-games-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
828,"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay taxes to the state. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","According to some people, income tax should be abolished and no one should have to pay any taxes to the state. I completely disagree with this notion and believe taxation is extremely crucial for the country’s development and helps in building an equitable society.
If people paid no taxes, the government would not have any treasury. Consequently, the government will not be able to build roads, rails, bridges, dams, schools and hospitals. In this scenario, even the basic necessities will have to be provided by private organizations making them expensive and unaffordable to the poor. As the government will not have any say in the administration of the country, it is hard to believe that there will be any steps taken for its development.
Another reason why I disagree with the idea of no taxation is that it would create inequality in society. The money will not be circulated through the system and as a result, the wealthy will become wealthier. The concentration of much of the wealth in the hands of a few will indirectly mean that the larger population will be exploited by a few. This will lead to the establishment of a capitalist society, removing any chances of equality and injustice. Overall, the poorer sections of the community will suffer the most and the upper class will have all the luxuries and comforts because of their money power.
To conclude, taxation is crucial for ensuring the equitable distribution of wealth. Hence, the idea of not paying taxes is dangerous because it will lead to the collapse of the nation by making the rich people richer and poor people poorer.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-they-should-be-able-to-keep-all-the-money-they-earn-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
829,"Some argue that it is responsibility of the parents to teach children about healthy eating habits, where as other believe that teachers should be responsible for teaching their students how to eat in a healthy way. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people believe that parents are responsible for developing good eating habits in children while others opine that it is the duty of teachers. In my opinion, this duty should be assumed by the parents.
Children these days are not careful about their eating habits as they are more prone to eating unhealthy foods such as burgers, chocolates and cakes. Such habits should be controlled by the parents before kids become addicted to junk food. Since the children spend most of their time at homes, I believe parents should be extra careful when it comes to their child’s eating habits. In other words they should create and follow a diet plan and strictly adhere to it so that the child receives optimum nutrition essential for his/her growth and development. For example, children can be given fresh fruits as their snacks at home rather than cookies and chocolates.
However, this does not mean that parents are the only people responsible for teaching good eating habits. It is essential that the teachers should also play a key role in teaching them about healthy lifestyle and make them understand so that they embrace / adopt the healthy habits in their day to day life. Teachers can give them an understanding of the importance of fruits and veggies and make them realize how healthy children can be by consuming them. For example, they can arrange a one day visit to the farms to teach children how the vital nutrients in fruits and vegetables keep them healthy.
In conclusion, both the parents and teachers should make an effort to ensure that children follow healthy eating habits. Even so, I believe that good eating habits start from home. If parents eat right, children will also adopt a healthy lifestyle and become fit.",7.5,some-people-argue-that-it-is-the-responsibility-of-the-parents-to-teach-children-about-healthy-eating-habits-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
830,In some countries the average weight of people is increasing and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing. What do you think are the causes of these problems and what measures could be taken to solve them?,"In some countries, obesity is becoming an epidemic. This also affects the fitness level of people. In my opinion, the main causes of obesity are the sedentary lifestyle of people and their unhealthy dietary habits. I believe the only method of combating this epidemic is to modify the life styles and food habits of those concerned.
Most cases of obesity and associated health problems are reported from developed countries. Actually, affluent people are more likely to be obese than their poor counterparts. Studies have shown that the most common causes of obesity are a sedentary lifestyle and excessive consumption of fast food and fizzy drinks. Various studies have also shown that individuals who exercise for at least 30 minutes per day and who follow a healthy diet have minimal chance of getting obese.
Another important reason for this fast growing problem is the lack of health awareness among the population. Most people including housewives and children neglect their health and that is a cause for concern. Schools in the UK now give a report of the weight of their students in the quarterly report to their parents. This shows the extent to which this epidemic has spread. In the past, the way of life itself assured good health. In a world without elevators, home appliances and luxury private transport, we were guaranteed of our daily dose of exercise.
The best way to curtail the spread of this menace is to attack it at the source. A good example is seen in Japan and Singapore where office workers and students are encouraged to get fit and exercise for 15 minutes. In countries like the UK, fast food and fizzy drinks are banned in and around schools and residential areas. More importantly, in Singapore, fitness is a measure of assessment at work and school.
In conclusion, the current lifestyle and eating habits are responsible for the rise in cases of obesity. Getting physically active and eating a healthy diet are the only way to combat this issue.",7.5,in-some-countries-the-average-weight-of-people-is-increasing-and-their-levels-of-fitness-are-decreasing-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
831,"Many Children have access to the internet and devices like smart phones, even at very young ages. Do you think this a good trend? What rules should children follow related to internet and gadget use?","Nowadays, it is commonly observed that most of the young kids are addicted to devices such as tablets, mobiles and iPods. In my opinion, excessive use of mobile devices has detrimental effects on children’s mental and physical well-being and hence parents should regulate their internet and mobile activity. This essay will give some guidelines regarding the correct use of mobile gadgets.
Mobiles and the internet certainly help children in many ways. For example, mobile games such as ‘Word Finder’ help them to make simple words out of the given set of letters. This will enhance their thought process and thus increase their cognitive skills which are very essential for a successful life. Also, learning to use these devices from a young age makes them smarter and more comfortable with technology.
On the flip side, if children are always using their mobiles and tablets, they will develop several problems. For example, mobile addicted children may perform poorly in school because of their inability to focus on their studies. They may also become introverts. In addition, there is a possibility that they will come across harmful or obscene content on the internet. However, forbidding children to use the internet or the mobile is not the solution. Instead, parents should impose some strict rules on the mobile and internet use of their children. For example, parents should monitor their children when they are on the internet. They should also set a limit to the amount of time children can use these devices.
To conclude, computers and mobiles can be both good and bad for children. Children can not only gain vast amount of knowledge by using electronic devices but also improve their analytical and cognitive skills. However, addiction to mobile devices and electronic media is detrimental for their mental and physical development. Hence, parents should monitor their internet activity and limit their screen time.",7.5,many-children-have-access-to-the-internet-and-mobile-phones-at-very-young-ages-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
832,Many countries are experiencing population growth and a need for more homes. Should these new homes be constructed in the existing cities or should new towns be built for this purpose? Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The population is increasing day by day and building housing / homes for all the people has become a major cause for concern. According to some people, new homes should be built within existing cities; however, others opine that new residential colonies should be built to house people who do not have a roof over their head. In my opinion, both options have their merits and demerits and the government should consider them both.
Expansion of existing city is a good idea as it is already functioning and has proper infrastructure. If more people join this group, there will not be any discomfort. In fact, they will also contribute towards the development and economic growth of that area by serving and paying taxes. Therefore, this would be a cheaper, easier and convenient way of accommodating the growing population. However, the government should monitor the number of occupants because over occupancy may deteriorate the quality of people’s lives in these areas.
On the other hand, building new towns is a great option if implemented in the right manner. If the government takes care of the industrial and agricultural development of a place, a new town can take birth. Also, this will generate a huge number of employment options. In addition, the creation of new small towns will discourage people from migrating to big cities. For example, Surat in Gujarat is a small town developed in this manner, today it is one of the top 10 industrial areas in India.
In conclusion, I believe that the problem of building housing for the increasing population can be tackled by expanding existing cities and constructing new towns. In either case, it is important for the government to ensure that adequate facilities are in place before cities are expanded or built.",7.5,should-new-homes-be-built-in-the-existing-cities-or-should-new-towns-be-built-for-this-purpose-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
833,"While some people consider global warming to be the most pressing environmental problem which we have at the moment, others believe that deforestation has more devastating impact on our world. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some people believe that global warming is the most challenging environmental issue that we have nowadays; however, others think deforestation has more destructive effects on earth. This essay will discuss why global warming and deforestation are both harmful for the environment.
On the one hand, global warming has caused a drastic rise in temperature all over the world. It is mainly because of the high / higher amounts of radiation reaching the earth due to the depletion of the ozone layer which is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon -dioxide and chlorofluro carbon. Because of such climatic changes, sea levels are bound to rise. For example, an article published by The Times in 2018 reported icebergs in Antarctica were melting at a higher rate than usual. If, this scenario continues increasing sea levels can cause an entire region to disappear or to be submerged. Moreover, the radiation effects can cause dreadful diseases affecting the skin and eyes.
On the other hand, the cutting down of trees on a large scale will affect the quality of air. Trees absorb carbon dioxide which emanates from the burning of fossil fuels and releases oxygen. Thus deforestation can result in high carbon dioxide levels and low oxygen levels which cause damaging effects on the environment. The high CO2 levels can actually contribute to global warming as well. Generally speaking, the effects of deforestation are usually limited to the area that has lost the forest cover. But global warming is a phenomenon which affects the living beings all over the world. If this issue is unresolved catastrophic events such as tsunamis and hurricanes can arise frequently and also make human beings vulnerable to deadly diseases.
In conclusion, deforestation and global warming are both harmful for the environment. While the effects of deforestation are limited to a particular geographical area, global warming has an impact on the whole planet.

834,"Some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and the academic world. Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Knowledge increases when it is shared and hence some people believe that scientific, technical and business information should be shared freely; however, others opine that it is better to keep some information confidential. In my opinion, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages.
We live in an age where new inventions happen almost every single day. Sharing this information is important because it helps to keep us updated with the inventions happening around us. Also, these researches can be used to develop technologies that can be used by people to ease their lives and for the betterment of the society. For instance, the invention of stem cells therapy pushed the boundaries of medical science. By using stem cells in laboratories we can create any organ we want! This regeneration helps us to avoid the danger of donor organ rejection. Sharing such useful inventions helps the students to be up to date with the recent procedures and thus become much better professionals.
On the other hand, sharing too much information can be dangerous. For example, research related to weapons and nuclear science is extremely sensitive and confidential. If it is fallen into wrong hands it can lead to wars and terrorist activity. Likewise, some information regarding business finances and the algorithm is kept confidential by companies to stay ahead of the competition. Sharing this information may incur major financial loss for the company and loss of its USP / competitive edge.
To conclude, my opinion is a neutral one. It is extremely important for the world to share knowledge regarding science and business but it is equally crucial to safeguard the information that is sensitive to companies and the country.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-it-is-good-to-share-as-much-information-as-possible-in-scientific-research-business-and-academic-world-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Several factors affect the growth and development of a child. According to some people / some people opine that parents have a greater role than school in shaping the character of children and making them good members of the society. I agree with this view.
The school is definitely an influence on children. Here they get to meet several other children coming from different social, cultural and financial backgrounds. Interacting with their peers is a great way for kids to learn tolerance and empathy. These two are the most important tools needed to keep our society safe and peaceful. It is important to understand that the school is our second home. So, the school is definitely a good place to learn values and good manners.
However, on the other side of the coin, it is my belief that our parents are more influential than our educational institutions. Our parents are our first teachers. In addition, they are the custodians of our rich culture, traditions and religious beliefs. Moreover, they hold an authority over us unlike the teachers or guides in our educational institutions. In this regard, our parents hold a moral obligation to correct us by taking strict disciplinary measures. This particular authority may not be enjoyed by the teachers in the schools. Because of this parental authority, corrective measures could be enforced by the parents whenever their children go astray. That probably also explains why successful people almost always attribute their success to their parents, and not to the institution they attended.
To conclude, I believe that parents and the environment at home play a greater role than the school in moulding a child into a responsible citizen.",7.5,some-people-think-that-parents-should-teach-children-how-to-be-good-members-of-society-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
836,Nowadays food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live?,"Food is now prepared with modern techniques which makes cooking convenient for people.  People can now make meals at much greater speed than before, without sweating much. Although this change has brought a lot gains, its drawbacks cannot be ignored.
On the one hand, people are enjoying easy cooking. In conventional methods of cooking, wood was burned to make fire. As the burning of wood produced a lot smoke, it was very difficult for people to prepare food and they often developed a lot of respiratory problems. Additionally, the utensils used for cooking were not very well engineered. For example, there was no way to control the degree of heat emerging from the flames. Also, there were no efficient tools to hold the hot utensils; people often had to use the clothes. Now people have chimney, stoves, induction cook top etc. at their disposal which make it hassle free to cook food.
On the other hand, there are some downsides to easily cooked food. These foods not only cause health problems but also make people lazy / but also develop the habit of laziness in people. Consequently, people with busy life schedules do not maintain a healthy diet and easily become addicted to these items, only to discover their harmful effects at a later date.
In conclusion, advancement of technology has led to easy preparation of foods and eliminated many problems faced in traditional methods of cooking.

837,"In some schools and universities, girls tend to choose arts subjects (e.g. literature), and boys tend to choose science subjects (e.g. physics). Why do you think this is so? Should this tendency be changed?","There are still many places in the world where science courses in schools are dominated by male students. There are many factors contributing to this phenomenon and it needs to be changed so that the choice of study is made entirely by the student’s genuine interest.
One of the reasons for this trend is that boys are generally more competitive and they choose more challenging and physically demanding courses like science and engineering while girls opt to study less competitive subjects like literature and history. Furthermore obtaining science degrees guarantee better job opportunities and hence boys who are considered as future breadwinners opt to study these courses. In developing countries, the majority of girls are still expected to become housewives to take care of the family and the idea of them pursuing a career as a medical doctor or a scientist is not much appreciated. Therefore because of the peer pressure and social influences, many female students end up taking less demanding arts courses just to receive a degree although they might have passion for studying science.
My view is that the decision to pursue art or science should be made according to their interest and preferences and not be influenced by social pressure. I have seen a medical student who wanted to study Philosophy but his parents forced him to join medical school and he ended up dropping out from the course because of his poor performance in studies. Students will excel in their chosen fields only if the choice was made willingly. Women should also be empowered to gain more confidence to enter male dominated environments like engineering or IT. History has proven that women are as good as men in science as we have witnessed a lot of female Nobel Prize winners in science.
In conclusion, gender stereotypes are still influencing the choice of study and career and I believe this trend should be changed. Every student should choose the subject they love regardless of their gender so that there will be more enthusiastic professionals in both art and science.",7.5,in-some-schools-and-universities-girls-tend-to-choose-arts-subjects-and-boys-tend-to-choose-science-subjects-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
838,Some people say that people should have a different amount of holidays according to their job. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Holidays are crucial for many people. For this reason some employees seek jobs / careers in fields that allow them more time off. Some people claim that this is unfair and argue that all jobs should have the same number of holidays. I disagree with this view for several reasons.
First of all, some jobs are more tiring than others. Office jobs, for example, are less exhausting than roles like teaching or working in a mine. Based on my personal experience, I know that teaching students, especially teenagers, is far more exhausting than doing some other jobs. Hence, certain jobs deserve and require more time off than others.
Secondly, some jobs can be performed only during certain months / periods of the year. Jobs like forest fire fighting or fruit picking are available only in the summer. Obviously, people employed in such sectors can have more holidays than others. At the same time, there are certain jobs that are so important that the holders of those jobs cannot have too many holidays. For example, a police officer cannot afford to have too many holidays because if they do not report to duty, the law and order situation will go out of control. Doctors and nurses also cannot have too many holidays because their service is crucial for keeping the society healthy.
To conclude, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that different jobs have different requirements and some jobs are mentally and physically more demanding. In my opinion, people holding such jobs should have more holidays than those who have less stressful jobs. Hence, I agree with the argument that the number of holidays should be determined by the nature of the job.",7.5,some-people-say-that-people-should-have-a-different-amount-of-holidays-according-to-their-job-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
839,It is considered by some that young people should be encouraged to leave home when they become adults; others say that it is better if they remain with family as long as possible. Discuss both view and your opinion.,"According to some people, youngsters should be motivated to leave their home and live on their own when they become adults. However, others believe that young people should stay with their families as long as possible. I personally opine that it is a wise decision to leave home at the beginning of one’s career, provided that one does not have any dependent family members. Now, I will discuss both the views in upcoming paragraphs.
Encouraging young people to leave their homes and be on their own is definitely a common trend seen nowadays and there are various reasons to support this argument. First, better job opportunities are available when people move to cities or other countries. This, therefore, helps in their career development and broadens their career prospects. Second, people become independent in addition to being confident and mature, when they leave their homes and live at far places. For example, now they learn to take decisions on their own, both personally and professionally, considering their growth and goals .
On the other hand, living with families has its own advantages which cannot be overlooked. First, people can remain under the guidance of their parents and elder members of house and develop qualities like respect, caring attitude towards them. This consequently helps them to stay connected to the roots of our culture and values. For example, studies have shown that adults who live in their families are more emotionally attached to them as compared to ones who live at distant places. Second, they can provide mental and emotional support to their parents whenever they need it.
However, in my opinion, although it is necessary for an individual to be career-orientated and independent in this competitive world, it should not be at the expense of your family and if  they are  dependent on you, it is better to stay with them and find an alternative to grow professionally and financially in your hometown. To conclude, there are certainly benefits to leaving home and being on one’s own. However, if your family is dependent on you, it is better to stay with them so that you can take better care of your needs.",7.5,young-people-should-be-encouraged-to-leave-home-when-they-become-adults-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

Discuss and give your opinion.,"There is no doubt that more and more youngsters are addicted to computer games. Therefore, a few people argue that this habit can affect their mental and personal health. I fully agree with the above statement and this essay will discuss a few concerns related to these games.
Firstly, most games are violent in nature. For instance, in games like Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty, there are many scenarios where players need to kill others violently. In addition, they have many other options which encourage everyone to perform brutal acts. This can change the behavior of young adults who may react violently over even petty issues within their home or even in college. Overall, if there is an increase in exposure to this type of electronic games they may become more aggressive.
Secondly, they can also reduce the bonding of adolescents with their friends and families as most of the games are not only addictive but also time-consuming. For example, all these games will have many levels and it may take months to complete everything. As a result, they will be spending most of their leisure time in finishing it rather than spending quality time with parents and classmates. So, these games can play spoilsport for youngsters in relationships.
In summary, this essay discussed how electronic games can cause violent behavior in youngsters and how they are affecting relationships. My opinion is in sync with the statement and I feel that they have a negative impact on young people.",7.5,an-increasing-trend-is-for-young-adults-to-play-computer-games-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
841,Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school. Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.,"Parents have always been concerned about their children’s education. Some people believe that home schooling is the best option, while others prefer regular schools. I personally believe that both systems have their own advantages but if I had to choose one I would pick the latter one.
To begin with, teaching children at home is more efficient in terms of academic performance. Pupils who are taught by their parents benefit from having one to one lessons. Instructors can pay more attention to them and therefore they boost the learning process. A research done / conducted by the US department of Education proved that kids who receive home education develop their linguistic and numerical skills earlier than their formal school counterparts. As a result, it is undeniable that children learn faster at home.
On the other hand, kids at schools not only learn academic subjects but also figure out how to socialize and cooperate with other students. Children at schools learn several social skills that will prepare them for their adulthood. For instance, they might learn how to stand up against a bully or how to work on teams. As a result, school students learn a wide range of social and academic skills that will be crucial for their future development.
To conclude, in my opinion home schooling might seem more practical but by taking this path, parents are denying their sons and daughters the opportunity to achieve key interpersonal abilities. In the future, some home schooling supporters would realize this drawback and try to develop a mixed method where students study at home some days and attend school the rest of the week.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-teaching-children-at-home-is-best-for-a-childs-development-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
842,"Today more and more tourists are visiting places where conditions are difficult, such as Sahara desert or the Antarctic. What are the benefits and disadvantages for tourists who visit such places?","Visiting remote places is becoming more popular nowadays. This kind of tourism offers new opportunities to travellers but it also has its drawbacks. In this essay I shall discuss the advantages and disadvantages of visiting areas where conditions are rough.
To begin with, certain landscapes and natural wonders located only in remote areas are unique and cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. No landscape is comparable to the Sahara desert or the Antarctic. If one wants to explore the wild nature and breathtaking scenery, one has to deal with difficult terrain. A clear example of that is the testimony of the Norwegian explorer Ann Straus. Straus, after enduring the perils of the Antarctic winter for 6 months describes in his biography one of the most beautiful sunrises ever seen by the human eye.  Thus, it is evident that there are some worthwhile places where conditions do not allow regular tourism.
On the other hand, venturing into wild places can be extremely dangerous as well. Many rookie adventurers and travellers perished / lost their lives while exploring unexplored lands. For example, the Red Cross warned that in the last two decades the casualties related with this kind of tourism increased by 75%. It is not hard to see that sometimes the price for venturing into such areas is too high.",7.5,today-more-and-more-tourists-are-visiting-places-where-conditions-are-difficult-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
843,"In some countries, men and women are having babies late in life. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative employment?","In some modern nations, more women are waiting until their late-thirties or forties to start having kids. As a result, the average age of first time mothers in increasing. This essay will explore the causes of this trend and explain why I believe it is a positive employment.
Firstly, more and more women delay marriage to gain higher educational qualifications or to establish themselves in jobs and careers. Women of this generation are not bound to the traditional concept of marriage; instead, they seek and have the freedom to pursue their own gorals. It is challenging for a woman to have babies and take good care of them while she is busy with her studies or work. What’s more, in order to have an edge in some competitive workplaces, women have no choice but to put off their plans for having babies.
Another reason why women and their partners decide to postpone having children is that advances in fertility technology allow them to make this decision. Thanks to technologies that allow the freezing of eggs, women can have babies even in their forties. This option has given women some flexibility in deciding the right time for them to have babies.
The preference for a delayed first pregnancy is a good phenomenon because it represents a stronger family focus and better parenting. Older parents who have secure jobs and income tend to have more financial ability to provide for their children with great education resources. In addition, without the stress of earning money, older parents can spend more time with their children and accompany them with patience. To conclude, the invention of fertility technology enables women to pursue their career goals and postpone the typical timeline for having kids. It is a beneficial trend because older parents can provide a better upbringing to their children.

844,Some people feel that sports are necessary to college education because they teach teamwork and other skills. Others feel that sports are a waste of money in college because athletes do not learn anything useful. What do you think?,"Sports play a vital role in developing many personality traits as well as social and moral values. For this reason, many people think that to foster these qualities in students, sports should be made an integrated part of college curriculum. However, in my opinion, sports should have no place in college programmes since it is a waste of time as well as money.
College is a place where students come to study academic subjects. They need the help and guidance of proficient teachers to comprehend and interpret difficult topics. Thus, the responsibility of teachers and college authorities is to expend their resources to upgrade teaching tools and to develop new teaching strategies rather than wasting those funds on sports’ coaches, instruments and the construction of big stadiums. After all, the objective of educational institutions is to help students achieve academic excellence.
Having said that, the students who have aptitude for sports can hone their skills by joining an institution that provides dedicated training in this field. These training institutions are designed with the sole purpose of sports education. Moreover, they hire trained teachers who can help students diagnose their weaknesses and strengths. Meanwhile, the college can devote this time for studies and vocational training that would give students practical knowledge in their field. This knowledge will help students to achieve excellence in their vocation and earn lucrative jobs.
To conclude, it is irrefutable that sports are of paramount importance in students’ lives, but providing training in it is not the responsibility of college. Instead, educational organizations should focus more on academics by utilizing its resources for educational purpose rather than physical education.",7.5,some-people-feel-that-sports-are-necessary-to-college-education-because-they-teach-teamwork-and-other-skills-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
845,Some scientists think that there are intelligent life forms on other planets and messages should be sent to contact them. Other scientists think it is a bad idea and would be dangerous. Discuss both views and give your opinion?,"A few scientists believe that we must establish contact with intelligent beings on other planets; however, others believe that it is a risky idea and can have disastrous consequences. In my opinion, contacting people from other planets can open new doors and widen our thoughts about other living beings; hence sending messages to other intelligent life forms is a good idea.
To start with, human beings have been persistently improving their knowledge over the years and the main reason behind the drastic development of human race was the urge to explore the unknown things. Furthermore, contacting other living forms is a great opportunity for humans to get exposure to the unknown facts and widen their horizons. Consequently, this exploration may unearth the facts and information about people living on other planets and shed light on some of the hidden or misunderstood facts about other planets in our solar system.
On the other hand, a few scientists believe that sending messages to aliens is a bad idea and can prove to be very dangerous. They believe that nobody can deny the fact that the operation to find other living forms may be a risky business. In addition to this, they may be more intelligent and shrewd than humans and can destroy our environment. Furthermore, the possibility of the intelligent life forms destroying humans to occupy our planet cannot be ruled out and should be thought about before initiating the operation to explore other planets for these alien life forms.
To conclude, humans have always initiated risky operations to satisfy their hunger for knowledge. This has always been the major reason for the dramatic development of human race. Hence exploring other planets for living forms may be risky but can open the door for the betterment of human race.",7.5,some-scientists-think-that-we-should-contact-intelligent-life-forms-on-other-planets-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
846,In our society there is far more attention on men’s sport than women’s sport. Do you think that this is a positive or negative development?,"In the world we live in today, people are more interested in sports played by men. In my opinion, this is an adverse trend. This essay will discuss how this over emphasis on male sports decreases interest of women in games and impacts their image in the society.
Attention and encouragement play a vital role in a person’s growth. When the female players do not get the same kind of treatment like male players do, they lose their morale and enthusiasm, since they know that no matter how hard they try, they will not get the same attention that men do In a recent study in Canada it was found that only 30% of women are interested in sports leagues and the rest cannot find a valid reason to participate.
Also, the lack of interest in female sports creates a wrong impression about the capabilities of a woman. Since women are not treated the same way as men in sports, people misjudge them and think they might not have the same talent that men have. If women are not given the chance to prove themselves, there is no way they can showcase their capabilities. For instance, in 2015 when the Men’s World Cup Cricket was played people had high hopes on the Indian team but they lost it. Immediately after, Indian women’s team won the world cup for which they did not get the much-deserved appreciation.
To recapitulate, when men’s sports gain more attention than women’s sports, it has a negative impact on the society as it not only brings down the enthusiasm of the women but also portrays them as weak and incapable.",7.5,there-is-far-more-attention-on-mens-sports-than-womens-sport-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
847,"In some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries, some people think that this is good for a country while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn. Discuss both views.","In both developing and developed countries, people often debate how much a person can earn. Some people argue that there should not be any restriction imposed on the earnings of the people as higher salaries benefit the nation. However, others tend to differ and feel that the government should cap the salaries of their citizens to reduce disparity in income.
On the one hand, it is often argued that people should be paid according to their caliber. They think that higher salary improves the standard of living which in turn contributes to the development of their nation. The higher salaried person will end up paying more income tax which is usually the major source income for the government authorities. The money collected from the tax is usually used for the development of the nation. Hence a higher salary is good for their motherland. For instance, in India, companies like Microsoft and Google are offering a handsome salary to their employees. While their employees are among the best paid in the world, they are also the highest taxpayers in the country.
On the other hand, many believe that the government should restrict the amount that their residents earn. The salary gap between them should not exist as it brings instability in the society. They prefer to keep a uniform pay-range for every job as it makes their economy stable. It reduces poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor. For instance, in Canada, every job has a minimum and maximum pay scale and their citizens are paid in that range. And because of this, Canada has become one of the most stable economies.
To recapitulate, many people across the world have relatively higher salaries which contribute to the development of their motherland. However, there are many countries like Canada, which has put up a pay range in order to maintain better parity in income.",7.5,in-some-countries-a-few-people-earn-extremely-high-salaries-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-2
848,The internet has made knowledge immediately available to people through computers and smart phones all around the world. Much of this knowledge is also free. Discuss the advantages and Disadvantages of this trend.,"The internet is like an ocean of knowledge filled to the brim that anyone can easily access on their computer or mobile phone. This essay will discuss the benefits and the drawbacks of this trend.
On the one hand, the internet offers in-depth information on any topic in a fraction of seconds. Firstly, it provides many web sites which have accumulated vast knowledge from many sources making it easier for educational purposes. If this option is not available then students will be forced to read / refer various books or speak to an expert to get answers to their questions. Secondly, the internet has made information gathering an enjoyable activity. For example, we can learn about geographical or historical information about our home or favorite places with the help of multimedia applications. Overall, we can get abundant knowledge through the internet.
However, readily available information is not without its disadvantages. Some of the materials / content we access on the internet may not be genuine. For instance, a few may carry propaganda or fake information and direct the users to do harmful things. Studies have shown that many terror outfits misuse social media platforms to lure youngsters into becoming a part of them. This is indeed a dangerous aspect of the internet and users should be prepared to protect themselves from such threats.
In conclusion, this essay discussed the advantages and disadvantages related to the availability of abundant information on the internet. In short, the benefits are enormous, but the drawbacks cannot be overlooked.",7.5,the-internet-has-made-knowledge-immediately-available-discuss-the-advantages-and-disadvantages
849,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In this era of technology, television is no more considered as a luxury; rather it is a necessity. However, it is often argued by many people that television has hindered the communication between friends and families while others tend to disagree with that argument. I personally think that television plays no role in maintaining friendship nor does it have anything to do with family ties. It is an individual’s responsibility to communicate with their friends and families on a regular basis.
Television is considered as a one of the greatest inventions by humans. It keeps us updated on the latest news from around the world. People follow various channels from across the world which suits their interest. Many youngsters watch their favorite show together which gives them a common topic of discussion. Television has also brought many cultures together. Many a time families connect over dinner and discuss their favorite shows. For instance, many reality television shows such as Indian Idol and Master Chef provide a platform to talented people to showcase their skills to the world. This also provides new opportunities for friendship.
However, the negative impact of television cannot be ignored. Some people are so much habituated to watching TV that it has become a kind of addiction to them. They tend to ignore their social and personal life because of this. This habit of theirs has also impacted their health. They are more comfortable, sitting in front of a TV, enjoying their favorite show rather than doing any physical activity. Unfortunately, this makes them obese and unhealthy.
In conclusion, television has clearly brought entertainment to our lives; however, spending too much time watching TV is never a good idea. As long as a there is a balance between the time spent in front of the TV and time spent with friends and families, no one can say that the television has impacted the relations of people.",7.5,television-has-destroyed-communication-among-friends-and-family-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
850,"The internet has transformed the way information is shared and consumed, but it has also created problems that did not exist before. What are the most serious problems associated with the internet and what solutions can you suggest?","The invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Bernese proved to be a turning point in the world of technology. It has opened various channels where users can share their information in a way that was not possible earlier. On the one hand this has made our lives easier but on the other hand it has also brought along several threats such as cyber crimes and cyber bullying. This essay will first discuss how the internet silently puts us at the risk of cyber crime and then suggest some solutions / measures to tackle these issues.
There are certain novel crimes that spread through social media platforms. Various types of cyber violation such as frauds, online money laundering and certain forms of malwares which intend to steal a user’s private data are on the rise now. Because of the anonymity offered by the platform social media has become the paradise of hate mongers. They target other users and hurl abuses at them sitting behind their screen. This is nothing but cyber bullying. Teenagers are the most vulnerable targets of the internet. Nowadays, adult content which can be really harmful for them is easily available on the internet.
However, these issues can be solved easily by implementing strict laws which intend to penalize the culprit. Many new users are not aware of the rules made by the government for these problems. Hence the government should run some kind of awareness sessions to ensure that people are aware of cyber laws and their right to privacy and protection. For instance, the Nigerian government in the year 2017 ran a successful campaign about cyber threats such as viruses and malware. This led to a dramatic reduction of data breaches. Also educating the young ones from an early age can be beneficial in stopping these crimes. Parents should also monitor the websites that are being used by their children and should implement certain firewalls to prevent their exposure to certain sensitive websites.
To sum up, the internet has made our lives easier by providing us various options to share our data. However it puts us at the risk of certain issues such as frauds, or scams. It also puts our privacy at risk. Even so, in my opinion, the impact of the internet on our lives is largely positive. As for the risks, there are several ways to mitigate them.",7.5,the-internet-has-created-problems-that-did-not-exist-before-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
851,Restricting air travel is the only way to prevent air pollution. Do you agree?,"Air travel is considered to be one of the main causes of air pollution. Some people believe that reducing the number of flights is the only way to address the problem. I completely disagree with that belief because aeroplanes are not the biggest polluters. Of course, they pollute but reducing their frequency is unlikely to have any real impact on air quality.
Decreasing the frequencies of aeroplanes is unlikely to help because the fewer planes that are still flying will continue to emit fumes. This means air pollution will still occur. In addition, if flights are not avavilable, people who use domestic airlines to travel within the country will be tempted to use their car. Cars, especially, those running on fossil fuels cause considerable pollution. In other words, air pollution levels will remain more or less the same even if air travel is restricted
What’s more, other causes of air pollution such as factories and automobiles will continue to emit harmful gases into the atmosphere. As a result, the decline in the number of airplanes will not prevent air pollution. For instance, according to Green Peace, the airplanes contribute to about 33% of air pollution and other factors such as industries and vehicles contribute to 35% and 30% respectively. Therefore, decreasing the number of flights will not prevent air-pollution as other factors will remain unaffected by that step.
In conclusion, I completely disagree with the argument that the restriction of air travel is will improve air quality because aeroplanes are not the only source of air pollution. If other factors such as the burning of fossil fuels continue unabated, we will not see any real improvement in air quality even if we reduce the number of flights.",7.5,restricting-air-travel-is-the-only-way-to-prevent-air-pollution-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
852,"By punishing murderers with the death penalty, society is also guilty of committing murder. Therefore, life in prison is a better punishment for murderers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is accepted by the whole world that a murder is the most heinous crime that can be committed by a person. Hence there are laws made in every part of the world to punish the murderer. While some people argue that a person who has committed a murder should be awarded the death penalty, others insist that the law cannot commit a murder and hence punishing the murderer with a life imprisonment is a better idea. I agree with this statement to a great extent. In my opinion, if the criminal is willing to reform himself, it is better to award life term instead of the capital punishment.
Many people believe that the death penalty is the best form of punishment for a murder since it keeps a check on the crime. Many people fear the punishment and are scared to commit these kinds of crimes due to the penalties involved. The death penalty is also useful to send a message to the rest of the world that no matter who you are if you commit a murder you are going to be executed for your actions. This fear is helpful to reduce the homicide in many countries.
On the other hand, there are people who believe that if a murderer is killed then the total number of murderers in the world remains the same. Therefore in order to penalize them, life imprisonment seems to be a better option. Firstly, the mental state of the criminal should be assessed before awarding any punishment. If the person is mentally unstable, a second chance should be given to him to rectify the crime that he has committed. Secondly, many people also believe that the execution of the murderer will not bring the victim back to life. So it is not a perfect compensation for the victim’s relatives.
In conclusion, people need to accept responsibility for their actions. Punishing murderers with death penalty is one way that the society can help people to realise the consequences of their actions. However, if the criminal repents his action life imprisonment may help him to reform himself and this in turn will benefit the whole society.",7.5,by-punishing-murderers-with-the-death-penalty-society-is-also-guilty-of-committing-murder-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
853,Most artists earn low salaries and should therefore receive funding from the government in order for them to continue with their work.  To what extent do you agree?,"Artists generally earn less all over the world; therefore it is believed that the government should help them financially so that they can continue their work. I completely agree with this sentiment as artists represent a country on the international stage so they have to be encouraged and also they play an important role in shaping the culture and history of a nation.

Art knows no boundaries and any good piece of art is appreciated around the world and this helps a nation to get recognition in the international circuit. In order to encourage this, the state has to fund the under paid artists so that they can represent their country in various fields. For instance, the greatest Bismillah Khan who used to play a musical instrument called Shehnai was from a very humble background. He was very talented and one of the best in his field. The government recognized this and supported him in every way. He went on to become the best musician in his domain globally and received many international awards. Thus we can see how funding an artist can make a country proud on the international platform.
Furthermore, artists play a significant role in taking the traditional culture forward through music, food, movies and many other artistic activities. As a result, in order to give a boost to the cultural activities the government should fund all the deserving artists. For example, handicraft industry is a very old form of art work in India. It is not a very highly paid job but directly connected to the traditions and customs of India. To support these handicraft workers the state has implemented many schemes through which they can obtain the benefits and gain reasonable amount of profit from their work. This step by the government has kept the traditional handicraft industry alive. Thus, clearly it is very vital for the administration to support the artists so that the old form of art and tradition is preserved and maintained.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the government has to support artists and fund them so that they can flourish in their fields and thus preserve the traditional culture and bring international recognition to a nation in different spheres.",7.5,artists-should-receive-funding-from-the-government-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
854,It is much more convenient to watch a movie on television or computer than buy a ticket and go to the cinema. In the nearest future the popularity of cinemas will drastically decline. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that the popularity of cinemas will reduce dramatically in the coming years because it is a lot more comfortable to watch a film on television or computer than purchasing a ticket to go to cinema. This essay disagrees with the argument that cinemas will become less popular.
Watching movies on a large screen provides better clarity of pictures and a higher level of entertainment and because of these reasons the audience, especially youngsters, will prefer to watch films in cinema theatres. Young adults enjoy going to the cinema because it is a fun and relaxing activity for them.
According to a recent article published in Times of India, a survey was conducted among young people interested in watching films. It was found that about 65 % of the younger generation chose to see movies in theatres along with their friends on weekends in order have a break from the usual routine. So, going to cinema is not only for watching movies but also for having some leisure time with friends and family. Watching movies on a large screen is a more satisfying experience than watching it on a TV or a laptop because the large screen offers more clarity.
While it is comfortable to watch films at home, people choose theaters with precise audio- visual effects because they cannot afford to have such a broad range of accuracy on their small screens. For example, nowadays there has been a rise in 3D and 4D films which can be watched only on specialized devices. Furthermore, watching movies on a big screen often makes people more delighted and satisfied.
To conclude, the popularity of cinema theatres will not diminish as young people enjoy watching movies in the theatre because they provide total entertainment and also because the large screen offers precise sound and visual effects.",7.5,it-is-more-convenient-to-watch-a-movie-on-television-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
855,Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant’s past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?,"In England and Australia, the jury is not given the previous crime history of the accused. Some lawyers believe that having access to all the previous records of the defendant helps the judges to pronounce accurate verdicts. I completely agree with the statement and shall put forth my arguments in the upcoming paragraphs.
It is pivotal for the bench to have past records of the criminal so that they do not make any prejudiced decisions. Previous history of the accused helps in deciding the severity of the punishment. For example, repeat offenders such as serial murderers and rapists should receive stringent punishment whereas someone who commits a crime under the influence of unfavourable circumstances should be treated more leniently.
Moreover, innocent people are also benefited, if the past records are taken into consideration as they will not be misjudged. For example, a girl may commit murder in order to protect herself from being raped. In other words, breaking the law for self-defense or such circumstances should not be compared with committing a crime intentionally. In this case, the clean history of the girl can save her from life imprisonment or from death sentence. Moreover, the previous history gives insight into the criminal’s social background, upbringing, education, character and mental health status. Therefore, the jury can read the subconscious mind of the convicted and take a well-defined, appropriate, conscious decision.
In conclusion, it is evident from the above arguments that the jury must be made aware of the comprehensive past records of the accused to make judgements without flaws.",7.5,under-the-british-and-australian-laws-the-jury-has-no-access-to-the-past-criminal-record-of-the-defendant-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
856,Many famous athletes advertise different products. What are the advantages and disadvantages of it?,"In the present age, a number of well-known players are doing different types of product advertisements. In this essay, we will throw some light on the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.
Let’s begin by looking into the merits of endorsements by sportspersons. Firstly, players can promote certain products in a better way because they themselves use some of these items in their line of work. Sachin Tendulkar, for example, does the advertisement of an energy drink which he consumes while playing the game. Because of this reason, his endorsement of the product sounds genuine. Secondly, players can make money by doing various types of advertisements. In general, advertisement companies give approximately 25-50 lakhs to the players who work for them. This is a great opportunity for them to convert their popularity and brand value into money.
On the other hand, there are some downsides to these celebrity endorsements. Primarily, this could take away the players’ focus from the game. To elucidate, last year, Virat Kohli, a renowned Indian cricketer, was not able to perform as expected in Asian Cup. Some people assert that this happened because he was featured in myriads of advertisements at that time which took his concentration away from the match. Furthermore, athletes could become money minded if they do a lot of advertisement campaigns. The result of this could be devastating for the players and ruin their game play. What’s more, sometimes players endorse poor quality products just because they are offered truckloads of money. In my opinion, this is a misuse of the trust their admirers have placed in them.
In conclusion, there is no doubt that popular players are advertising several products and this phenomenon has some obvious drawbacks and benefits which are given in the above paragraphs. All in all, it is up to the players to decide whether or not they should do these types of advertisements.",7.5,many-famous-athletes-advertise-different-products-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

People are travelling from one place to another place due to a variety of factors such as globalisation. Travelling assists us to learn various cultures and it helps in promoting the travel industry.
Globalisation is one of the main reasons for the increase in travelling. Nowadays, people are travelling due to various reasons, such as education, business and recreation. Globalisation has opened up the boundaries of the countries and provided ample opportunities. It is through globalisation that we are now able to expand our scopes of horizon across other nations. For instance, it is seen that students are applying to international colleges for further studies, this is mainly because of globalisation and it is noticed that there are more students enrolling for international studies than in the past.
There are many benefits that we get while travelling. One of the merits is that we learn about many different cultures and this actually assists us in making our bonds with other nations stronger. We also learn to respect the culture and values of other nations. This further assists us in showcasing our own culture on an international platform. As a result, it opens up the scope for any kind of support from the international countries. Furthermore, travelling has an impact on the growth of the travel industry. The travel industry is one of the major contributors of the GDP for many countries and regions, such as Singapore, Malaysia and the Middle East. This has also assisted us in providing many employment opportunities for the people, thus improving the lifestyle of the country.
In conclusion, globalisation is one of the major reasons for the increase in travelling.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.,"In recent decades, the world has become more connected due to the advancement in the communication technology and the economical rates of the internet services. A few educationists have put forward a proposal to include International news as a mandatory subject for secondary school students. I support this view. In this essay, I shall put emphasis on the benefits of including global news in the academic syllabus of the secondary school students.
To begin with, regular update on the worldwide news keeps the pupil aware of the international sports events and their results. It has been seen as an encouraging factor for children and inspires them to participate in various sports competitions. To explain it further, this awareness will play a vital role in India, where academics have always received paramount importance in schools. A recent study conducted by one of the famous sports institutes, shows that sports people’s struggles and achievements in different fields leaves a lifelong positive impact on youngsters than on adults.
In addition, the International news about a calamity prepares the young minds for any non-favorable conditions. It also teaches them to stay united to overcome the disaster and its aftermath. For instance, when Tsunami destroyed Japan’s historical monuments and its modern infrastructure, the tremendous effort made by Japanese people to overcome the situation motivated many young minds to think about plans to mitigate future disasters.
In conclusion, giving children a mandatory exposure to the latest happenings outside of their country always motivates them to have a healthy discussion with their peers and directs their minds towards better life and career prospects.",7.5,some-people-think-that-international-news-should-be-included-in-the-school-syllabus-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
859,Most artists earn low salaries and should therefore receive funding from the government in order for them to continue with their work. To what extent do you agree?,"In this scientific era, most people have lost interest in arts and as a result, artists are struggling to make a living. In my opinion, great things will happen if artists receive financial aid from the government.
For most artists, art is their main job and their primary source of income. In addition to that, most of them are extremely passionate about what they do and spend massive amounts of time and effort to excel in their work. Therefore, when they do not earn enough from it, they are forced to give up their pursuit of art. Hence, it will be beneficial if the government offers them a monthly stipend or pension to take care of their living expenses. This will allow them to stay committed to art. For example, my grandfather was a talented painter with great creativity yet he lived a very difficult life because he did not earn much and hence his wife and children had to live in poverty. Had the government supported him financially , he would have been able to live comfortably and produce more works of art.
Furthermore, art is essential to protect the culture and the tradition of a country. Without art, many cultures will disappear. For instance, the ancient Egyptians protected their culture with a tremendous amount of artistic designs which ornament the pyramids. Arabs, on the other hand, preserved their history through poems which they passed down from one generation to another and gave the world a clear image of their previous lifestyle.

860,"Today’s society provides people with various ways to lose weight, such as special diets or exercise regimes. Many people believe though that poor food and today’s lifestyle should be addressed first. What is your viewpoint of the situation?","Here is a band 7.5 IELTS essay on this topic submitted by one of our students. Need help with writing? Get your writing samples corrected by me.
Nowadays, people are so busy with their life that they do not have time to cook a meal for themselves and hence they prefer eating junk food or a packet food. Due to such habits our generation is more prone to developing diseases like obesity, diabetes and heart problems. Many people hit the gym or adopt a strict diet to lose weight. However, some people believe that before going on a strict diet or an exercise routine we should address poor food habits and unhealthy lifestyles. I agree with this view.
In my opinion, it is very important for us to be aware of what we are eating and how we are managing our daily life. This knowledge is essential to make healthy changes to our lifestyle. For example, it is important for us to monitor our eating habits. Eating packet food or frozen food is of no help, as it includes preservatives, chemicals and artificial flavors which are not good for the human body. Rather than eating junk, people should prefer cooking fresh meal with the fresh ingredients in their own kitchen. Eating fresh food will help them to stay active and away from many diseases. Moreover, they will get the required vitamins and nutrients as well.
Sleep is another area that we need to pay attention to. The modern lifestyle has seriously affected our sleep cycle. As we know, many people work in shifts due to which they have a complete different sleeping time. This can upset their biological clock. Even those people who work in day shifts fail to go to bed at the right time. After coming back from work people prefer to be on their phone instead of going to work. Instead of sleeping, they either play games or watch movies or talk to their friends; this keeps them awake for many hours and by the time they go to sleep, it is their wake-up time. Such habits unfortunately take a toll on their health.
In the end, I would like to conclude by saying that a strict diet and an exercise regimen are definitely good for life. However, it is important to make adequate changes to our eating habits and lifestyle before adopting a diet or hitting the gym.",7.5,today-society-provides-people-with-various-ways-to-lose-weight-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
861,The best way to improve health is to do regular exercise. To what extent do you agree?,"It is a well-known fact that exercise is essential for good health. Some people believe that the most effective solution for improving health is to exercise daily. I can only partially agree with this opinion because having a nutritious and healthy diet is equally necessary for enhancing health.
Regular exercise is beneficial for our health in several ways. It strengthens bones and muscles and thus helps avoid many health problems, especially during old age. Exercise also keeps blood pressure and cholesterol in control to prevent heart-related diseases. Additionally, scientists have proven that regular exercise increases mental fitness and helps prevent stress. Thus it is evident that exercise enhances mental ability as well as physical fitness and thus prolongs life.
However, if exercise is not supplemented with a healthy and nutritious diet, the human body will not be able to reap benefits. A research performed by students at the University of Michigan suggests that exercise will not aid health if the diet is not controlled. Muscle fibres break apart when we exercise hard and they need to be repaired by proteins in our diet. So, heavy protein intake becomes essential for regular exercise. Similarly, if we exercise for longer periods, then carbohydrates and fats are also vital for our body. Moreover, exercising daily does not mean that we are allowed to eat food with high sugar or salt.
To conclude, day to day exercise is the best solution for developing and improving health provided that it is supported well with a nutritious and balanced meal.",7.5,the-best-way-to-improve-health-is-to-do-regular-exercise-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
862,"Some people view giving presents as an important way to show care to family and friends, others think there are more important things that can be done to show care and love. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, exchange of gifts has become a trend among people of all ages. People always find a reason to give gifts- be it festivals, birthdays, anniversaries or other celebrations. While some people believe that giving presents to others is the best way to show our love and affection for them, others opine that there are many other ways to show that we care.
In my opinion, there are better ways than giving gifts to show our love for family and friends
Most of the youngsters give luxurious gifts to friends to show their love for them. They believe that the more expensive the gift, the stronger the bond.
Another reason that promotes this culture of gifting is that people are busy and feel guilty about it. They do not have much time to spend their family or friends. Consequently, they buy them gifts to overcome their sense of guilt. It is quite common for working parents to shower gifts on their children to compensate for their inability to spend quality time with them.
However, in my opinion, gifting is not the right or best way to show our affection. A gift is an object with a limited shelf life. It can never be the best expression of love. Helping family and friends during their difficult time is the best way to show our love and concern for them because only those who truly love us stand by us in our difficult situations. I think no present is more precious than the gift of time. For instance, if any of your family member or friend is suffering from some health issues, spending time with them and offering them all the support we can is the best way to show that we care for them.
To conclude, in my perspective, it is very important to show love and care to our near and dear ones but gifts are not the only way to express our feelings. There are other important ways to express it to others. Helping others in difficult times is the best way to express love and care rather than presenting them gifts on different occasions.",7.5,some-people-view-giving-presents-as-an-important-way-to-show-care-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
863,"Some employers want to be able to contact their staff at all times, even on holidays. Does this development have more advantages than disadvantages?","Many employers want to be able to contact their staff 24 hours a day 7 hours a week. In my opinion, this practice has more disadvantages than advantages.
Contacting staff outside work hours is detrimental to both the staff and the employer in the long run. To start with, this impinges on the work-life balance of employees. People have multitude of facets beyond work, such as family member, friend and last but not the least their own personal self. Logical separation of personal life from work life is critical to the wellbeing of the individual concerned and other stakeholders. Contact from work during personal or family time is a direct infringement on the life of the staff. Furthermore, everyone needs a break from work for them to sustain their productivity. In fact, the common pause that any human needs from all activities, not just work, is sleep. For example, if people are disturbed in their sleep hours by employers, it will have repercussions for their health and consequently it will impact the employer as well. Contacting staff on their holiday is counterproductive as it defeats the very purpose of holiday, which is to take quality break from the daily grind.
Having looked at the downside of contacting staff outside work hours, let us consider if there are any advantages to this approach. Proponents of this approach of contacting staff at all times claim salutary effect, thanks to the so-called avoidance of delays in decision making. However, such arguments are ludicrous. Lack of work life balance and quality time-off takes a heavy toll on the mental and physical health of employees. Needless to say, not only will this impede the productivity of the employer, but also depreciate the morale of other employees and that can further the loss for the employer.
In conclusion, there are tremendous disadvantages to this idea of contacting staff at all times, and the so-called advantages are only fictitious.",7.5,some-employers-want-to-be-able-to-contact-their-staff-at-all-times-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
864,Many criminals commit further crimes as soon as they are released from prison. What do you think are the causes of this? What possible solutions can you suggest?,"Many criminals commit crimes again after serving time in prison and thus become a threat to the society. In my opinion, lack of employment and rehabilitation opportunities is the main cause of this disturbing phenomenon. The only way to prevent ex-prisoners from reoffending is to ensure that they are properly re-inducted into the society.
Most organisations are reluctant to provide employment to a person accused of a crime or an offence. Such an individual is perceived as a threat to the organization and thus denied a job at the company. For example, the employer may fear that the convicted person will continue the malpractices and eventually cause loss to the company. Unfortunately, an unemployed ex-prisoner has a tough time making a living and in their desperation they get into crime again. The society’s apathetic attitude to convicts is another reason that prevents their reformation. Someone who committed a crime is considered as a criminal even after they complete the punishment. Consequently, many convicts tread the wrong path again.
In order to ensure that any lawbreaker walks the right path after the punishment, the government needs to provide an opportunity to improve by the provision of at least a low paying job. Convicted criminals also need counseling so that they understand the need to reform themselves. If an individual is offered a chance to live with dignity again as well as guided for personality development, he or she is less likely to reoffend. For example if someone guilty under the law for monetary theft has a chance to earn income through righteous ways, there is an assurance that the same offence will not be repeated by the person. Thus, to prevent the criminals from repeating their crimes, it is necessary that they are introduced to possible solutions to lead a good life again.
To recapitulate, many of the convicted criminals tend to continue their heinous practices even after serving time in the prison. The essay discussed how the inability to earn a living and lack of personal awareness has led criminals to commit more crimes after being released. This essay also suggested solutions to reduce re-offending by providing fair opportunity for improvement along with proper counseling.",7.5,many-criminals-commit-more-crimes-as-soon-as-they-are-released-from-prison-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
865,Some people feel online courses are better while others feel classroom courses are good. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"Whether online courses are better than classroom courses has always remained a contentious issue. While it is considered by some that the traditional way of learning i.e. classroom training is better, others go with the modern way of online learning. In my opinion, classroom training is the best. However, I also believe that online courses have their own merits.
There are numerous reasons to support the viewpoint of people who believe that classroom courses are better. Firstly, by being physically present in the classroom, a student can directly interact with the teacher and clear doubts. In addition, there is the scope of getting practical training that will benefit the pupil in acquiring in-depth knowledge. Also, a recent study by a psychologist has shown that interacting with peers in the classroom enables a child to be more socially active. This live interaction makes the learning process more enjoyable.
However, some people argue that online courses are better. According to them, online courses are more affordable than traditional ones. In addition to this, people are not bound by a timetable when they do a course online. Hence, they can study as per their convenience. Another major advantage of taking up online courses is that one can avoid the risks involved in commuting. Also, students can save the time required for commuting. Even so, the lack of supervision may hinder the progress of students when they do online classes. In my opinion, this method of learning is only suitable for the self-motivated students.
In conclusion, although both the courses have their own merits and demerits, I believe that classroom courses are the best as they help in the overall development of a student. Even so, it is good to have choice and online courses are a boon for students who cannot enroll in a regular course.",7.5,some-people-think-online-courses-are-better-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
866,"Some people think that children should learn geography in school. However, some others think that it is more important to learn subjects that are more relevant to life. What is your opinion?","According to some people subjects like geography are not particularly helpful for students and hence they should not be taught at school. In my opinion, all subjects should be given equal importance up to high school. Afterwards, students should have the option of studying only those subjects they want to study.
Contrary to what a lot of people might think, geography is actually a useful subject. It gives us information about the world we live in. It makes us familiar with our landscapes and various natural phenomena. A decent understanding of geography is essential to travel safely and efficiently. Geography can even save lives. For example, by studying weather patterns, many natural disasters can be predicted and life and property can be saved.
To exemplify, In India, the prediction of cyclone Titli in 2018, saved hundreds of lives as people were moved from the epicenter of the storm to safer refugee camps in time. Thus, it is evident that geography is certainly a useful and relevant subject and it should be taught and learned.
Having said that, other subjects like science, mathematics and computer are also important. Actually, students pursuing science subjects tend to have better career opportunities. Because of this reason many parents and teachers insist that only these subjects should be taught at school. In my opinion, it is a faulty approach because a basic understanding of every subject including history, geography and literature is essential to succeed in this world. Actually, there is no such thing as an irrelevant subject because knowledge of all kinds benefits us in one way or the other. Hence, rather than eliminating geography from the school curriculum, we should make it an optional subject after high school.
To conclude, all subjects are important and beneficial and hence all of them should be taught to school students. However, at the secondary and tertiary level, career oriented courses like science and technology should be given more importance and subjects like history and geography should be optional.",7.5,some-people-think-that-children-should-not-learn-geography-at-school-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
867,Some governments say how many children a family can have in their country. They may control the number of children someone has through taxes. It is sometimes necessary and right for a government to control the population in this way. Do you agree or disagree?,"In many countries, the government has the authority to decide how many children its people can have. Some governments try to control the population by imposing taxes on people who have more children than is permitted. In my opinion, in order to control the population growth, the government should have the legal authority to determine the size of families. In this essay, we will first examine how the problem of overpopulation can be controlled through such measures and also how proper check on population can lead to an increase in the economic growth of a nation.
The world is witnessing the negative effects of overpopulation like crime, illiteracy and pollution in many countries. With the implementation of taxes, people will understand the benefits of having a small family and this will in a way make them plan for a baby well in advance. For example, China follows a two child policy and citizens violating the law often have to pay hefty fine or face other types of punishment. Such stringent laws have enabled them to control their population growth and now China is developing rapidly.
If a state authority is able to control the birth date by imposing higher taxes or fines on violators, they will definitely observe an elevation in the economic and social growth of their country. People will have a healthy standard of living. Children will grow up to be more disciplined as well as responsible citizens of their country. Thus it is evident that this measure will boost the economic growth of the country. For example, according to a survey conducted by a UK university, families having one or two kids are the happiest.
In conclusion, the government should have the legal authority to reduce the size of families by imposing fines or other types of punishment on people who have more children than is permitted. While this might seem to be a violation of the rights of citizens, in the long run it will benefit everyone by helping the economy grow. Thus, in my opinion, such measures are justified.",7.5,some-governments-say-how-many-children-a-family-can-have-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
868,"In many countries, the amount of rubbish is rapidly increasing, why? Give your solutions.","These days the increasing volume of trash is a major concern in many countries around the world. This problem has arisen due to various reasons which I will discuss in the subsequent paragraphs along with some proposed measures to tackle this issue.
To begin with, there are many factors responsible for the increasing production of rubbish and the predominant one is the increase in population. Nations around the globe have been grappling with the problem of population explosion for more than a decade. Many people buy products they do not need and eventually they end in up landfills producing garbage at an alarming rate. Moreover, non-biodegradable products are a serious threat which leads to the production of excessive waste. For instance, it is scientifically proven that material like plastic does not decompose in the environment for several hundred thousand years.
Appropriate measures need to be taken to deal with this alarming threat. Primarily, the government should impose strict rules and regulations to replace plastic with a biodegradable materials. In addition, new technology should be introduced for the safe disposal of waste material like garbage. For example, many countries in Europe now use rubbish to build roads by converting plastic to adhesive substance. This new technology should be imported so that the amount of waste would reduce.
To recapitulate, there is no denying the fact that people all over the world are producing rubbish at an alarming rate. In order to deal with this issue, the government should enact laws that ban or limit the use of plastic. It should also encourage the use of biodegradable products.",7.5,in-many-countries-the-amount-of-rubbish-is-increasing-rapidly-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
869,"People are living in a ‘throwaway society’, using things for a short time and then throwing them away. What are the causes of this? What problems does it lead to?","Nowadays, it is increasingly common for people to buy new things frequently. Unfortunately, this also encourages them to throw away old but usable things. This trend has a negative effect on the environment.
People are inclined to buy new things mainly because of the irresistible advertisements. Manufacturers promote their new products rigorously and capitalize on the needs and wants of people. For instance, every year companies launch a new model of smart phones. Even though it would have the same functionality as the previous model, people are attracted by the promotions and buy it. Another reason for this compulsive urge to buy is the busy lifestyle of people. Nobody has time to fix things that have stopped working. Actually, buying new stuff is easier than getting things repaired.
Admittedly, this trend has become a serious threat to our environment. Excessive production of goods leads to the depletion of natural resources. For instance, many trees are cut down to produce various household items. If people wanted to replace their furniture more frequently, it would result in destruction of forests. In addition, when products are thrown away, they produce more garbage. Many consumer goods have non-recyclable parts that will remain in the soil forever. Thus by throwing away goods we are unwittingly causing damage to the environment.
To conclude, the throwaway culture is a reflection of our materialistic mentality. We have little regard for nature or natural resources. However, considering the destruction it would cause to the environment, this practice needs to be curtailed / discouraged. The government should launch campaigns to create awareness about the dangers of throwing away goods and also enact laws that make recycling mandatory.",7.5,people-live-in-throwaway-society-ielts-essay-sample
870,Successful sports professionals can earn a great deal more money than people in other important professions. Some people think this is fully justified while others think it is unfair. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"The salaries of sports professionals are much higher than those of people in other professions. Some believe that this is the right approach, whereas others consider this to be unjustifiable. In my opinion, there should not be a significant difference between the earnings of sports people and other professionals.
Those who support the high earnings of sports professionals claim that the sports stars should earn high salaries because they are under constant pressure to perform. In addition to this, they are highly skilled people who bring name and fame for the country. Talented sports men and women can even enhance the reputation of their country by winning international championships. Yet, there is no justification for giving them astronomical salaries especially since their contribution for improving the lives of their fellow people is negligible.
On the other hand, there are other professions such as teaching and medicine which are even more important than sports. The amount of money one makes should be equivalent to the value of service one provides to the society. Teachers play an important role in imparting knowledge and shaping the character and personality of children. Similarly doctors work tirelessly to save precious lives. These professionals should earn high salaries because of their valuable services. But this is not the case. For example, the annual salary of a teacher is less than the single match fee of cricketers in India. This cannot be justified in any way.
To conclude, I believe that a huge gap in the salaries of sportspersons and other professionals is neither fair nor healthy and hence the government should enact policies to narrow this pay gap. The government should raise the salaries of other valuable professions and meanwhile collect higher taxes from sports professionals to ensure balance in the society.",7.5,successful-sports-professionals-can-earn-a-great-deal-more-money-than-people-in-other-important-professions-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
871,Space exploration costs taxpayers exorbitant amount of money each year. What are the advantages and disadvantages of spending money on space exploration?,"Enormous amount of taxpayers’ money is being spent on space exploration every year. There are benefits as well as drawbacks associated with space missions.
One of the main advantages of space exploration is that it has provided us with deeper insights into the universe as well as the knowledge of the world we live in. For example, scientists are able to predict weather patterns and natural disasters with the help of satellites. Also space missions help the scientists develop new scientific technologies. These latest technological innovations have been proved useful not only for astronauts but also for people living on this planet. For instance, GPS system, which is used in smart phones and tablets, is developed with the help of satellites. It is also possible to predict natural disasters with the help of satellites.
However, there are also some downsides to exploring and finding out more about the universe. One evident drawback is that it endangers the lives of astronauts. Many accidents happened in the past. For example, the Challenger space shuttle exploded within minutes of its launch. Moreover, billions of dollars are required to build spacecrafts and shuttles. And if the mission fails, the whole of that money is lost.
This is money that could have been used to reduce the sufferings of humans on earth. Millions of people still do not have enough to eat. Countless others live in refugee camps or in extreme poverty. If even a fraction of the money spent on space research is used for improving the conditions on earth, the world would be a much better place to live in.
To conclude, space research certainly enables us to learn more about the universe and because of this reason it is worth spending money on it. However, spending too much money on space research is not a worthy endeavour because there are more pressing problems on earth. Also space missions have a higher risk of failure.",7.5,space-exploration-costs-taxpayers-exorbitant-amount-of-money-each-other-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
872,Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences.,"People often debate whether or not tourists should respect the culture and traditions of the country they visit. While some people think that they should others opine that the people of the host country should accept cultural differences. This essay will discuss both sides in depth and give my opinion.
Some people think that visitors ought to follow the traditional ways of life and cultural values of the indigenous people and they should pay respect to the local cultural perspectives. They claim that visitors should try to assimilate the culture of the host country and this can be done by learning about their ideas and views of life prior to their visit. This would also save them from culture shock.
For instance, a recent survey showed that native Australians would highly appreciate it if visitors paid respect to their sacred places. Similarly western people when visiting Asian countries should try to dress up accordingly. Following local culture and behaviours would create a sense of love and respect and as a result tourists would also be able to learn and explore more.
Others believe that local inhabitants of the host country should accept and welcome tourists with different cultural backgrounds. They argue that different traditions and different lifestyles would help promote diversity in an area. The diversity of the cultures also makes a place a popular tourist attraction. As a result, tourism would grow and the economy of the country would flourish. Take London, for example. Londoners accept people with different nationalities and cultural backgrounds and this has made it a rich and diverse cosmopolitan city.
Locals also need to understand that visitors have a different culture and perspective. It is not ethical of them to expect the visitor to behave exactly like them. Once they realize that cultural differences are normal, they can receive the visitors will open arms. Another thing that the natives need to understand is that tourism benefits them more than the visitors. Countries that appreciate cultural differences tend to attract more international visitors and have more robust economies.
To conclude, cultural differences are normal and this is something that both natives and visitors need to understand. Foreigners should make a conscious effort to follow local customs and traditions when they are abroad. At the same time, locals should not expect the foreigner to behave exactly like them or to have the same worldview.",7.5,5153-2
873,Some people believe that children are given too much freetime. They feel that this time should be used to do more school work. How do you think children should spend their free time?  Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people suggest that children should spend their free time on school work. Although  this suggestion is beneficial for their grades, this can lead to some problems. For instance, children who are forced to do more homework in their free time are becoming less sociable. Also more work increases their stress level so allowing them to be free in their leisure time may lead to an increase in their happiness.
I think that children should spend their free time with their friends in the parks or they can spend their time on activities that they enjoy doing the most. Playing in the park with their friends contributes to their social skills in a positive way. Also, they can do a variety of things that they enjoy such as, playing with their toys or drawing pictures. These activities may increase their creativity. Another benefit of having free time without extra school work could be that children may find hobbies that are enjoyable to do. So there are many fun and enjoyable activities that kids can do in their free time to keep them fruitfully occupied.
In conclusion, even though studying for school work in children’s free time could be useful, there are also negative sides to that choice and spending time on other activities like playing with friends or spending time on art could have more positive impacts on them.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-children-are-given-too-much-free-time-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
874,"Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is no doubt that technology has had a tremendous impact on our lives. Some people opine that technology is widening the difference among the rich and the poor. I agree with this idea to a certain extent but in my opinion, technology has also enhanced the living standards of the poor.
On the one hand, there are many reasons why wealth inequality is increasing. The main cause is that the rich can easily afford automatic equipment. This is because they earn more and have a huge amount of bank savings. Thus, their work is done quickly which facilitates increased income. To illustrate, rich people can purchase computers and expand their business online; hence their earning capacity increases. If computers and the internet had not been invented, the gap between upper and lower class would not have increased like this.
On the other hand, the same technology is also improving the living conditions of the poor. Smart phones and the internet have become quite accessible these days and almost everyone has them. Free or cheap internet is the biggest game changer of the 21st century. For example, Ola application on mobile phones have enabled the taxi drivers to find customers easily; thus, maximising their profits. The internet has also enabled many poor students to earn degrees through distance education from reputed colleges at a low cost. As a result, there is a drastic change in the lifestyle of those people who can easily find job on the basis of that qualification.
In my opinion, though modern technology has helped to increase the earnings of the rich, this has also assisted in uplifting the standard of living of the poor people by providing them with new opportunities to earn income through different ways.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-modern-technology-is-increasing-the-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
875,"University education should be free to everyone, regardless of income. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people believe that everyone should have the opportunity to attend university without paying tuition fee but others disagree with this idea due to some reasons. I strongly disagree with the idea of free education in university. This essay will explain why university education should not be free to everyone.
University students pay some amount of tuition fee so that universities can improve the standard of the learning materials they use. Most institutions use these fees to obtain some equipment such as projectors and computers in order to enhance the learning experience of their students. For instance, in Sabanci University, Mechanical Engineering lectures are taught with CNC machines to enable students to understand better. So, tuition fee is crucial for universities to obtain state-of-the-art equipment in order to provide quality education to their students.
On the other hand, some people believe that universities should be free to everyone because every student has the right to education regardless of their income. They argue that some people cannot get university education due to financial problems if it is not free. However, scholarships are the solution to this problem and some portion of tuition fees are used for other students who are not capable of paying for university.  This solution could prevent the inequality between students of different income levels.
In conclusion, every people should have the chance to get a university education but students should pay a fee for this. This payment is crucial for schools to obtain equipment that are beneficial for learning. Also, these fees are used for other students as a scholarship in most of the universities.",7.5,university-education-should-be-free-to-everyone-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
876,"Some people think that the main factors influencing a child’s development these days are things such as television, friends, and music. Others believe that the family still remains more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Raising children into mature and successful adults is a big responsibility and it has become even more challenging today than in the past. Parents and siblings used to be the first and foremost influence on a child’s development, but the rapid expansion of technology and cultural changes have significantly impacted the way in which a child will develop. However, I still firmly believe that family holds greater power to affect a child’s behaviour in her development stages due to the fact that it is the family that the child is going to spend more of her time with and thus get more exposure from.
Studies have shown that children learn by seeing and observing what the adults around them do. Since the father and the mother are the first point of contact for a child, they will learn a great deal from them in early years. As the child grows older, they might be introduced to new sources of information. For example, they could be influenced by their friends or the movies they watch. Even then, family will be the greatest influence on the child because parents can monitor the friend circle of the child and minimize the unwanted impact. They can also decide what programmes the child should watch on television or which songs they should listen to.
To conclude, a child may be influenced by people and factors outside of their home; even so, family will be the biggest influence on them because parents can control the external influences to a great extent.",7.5,some-people-think-that-television-friends-and-music-are-the-main-factors-that-influence-a-childs-development-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
877,Some people say that the internet is bringing people together by making the world smaller. Do you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?,"Geographical barriers have become meaningless in this age of the internet. In my opinion, the internet has certainly changed the way we communicate and made it easier and more effective although it does have some minor flaws.
Firstly, the internet made globalization possible by bringing people and communities together. Almost all the organizations, small or big, use emails which works on the internet to pass important information to all employees. Furthermore, video conferencing has been effectively introduced since long in conference rooms where executives come together under one virtual screen irrespective of their real location. In fact, even the job interviews are now being conducted using various applications like Skype which save precious time and money which would be spent otherwise on travelling. In addition, visual tele-conferencing has enormously benefited the medical field by enabling doctors in multispecialty hospitals to consult their peers. On the personal front, it is now feasible to talk to near ones sitting across the earth with astute video and audio clarity which was once limited to the realm of scientific fiction. This has greatly benefitted many lives where family members move far away to pursue their career or education.
However, the only drawback of communicating via the internet is that it lacks the personal touch and human beings are becoming more and more dependent on it which is also increasing the gap between the people residing under same roof. This in my view is changeable by making a conscious effort and utilizing this facility sensibly.
To conclude, I reiterate that in this fast paced millennium, where communication is one of the core skill sets and plays the key role in development and progress of any country or individual, the internet has proven to be a boon in many ways.",7.5,some-people-say-that-the-internet-is-bringing-people-together-by-making-the-world-smaller-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
878,Some people think that it is a good idea to have a detailed plan for activities to do in their free time. Others disagree with this. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Some people are in favour of organizing their pastime activities, whereas others opine that there is no need to plan leisure time activities. While both methods have their advantages, I am inclined to support the latter view.
Planning one’s free time activities has several benefits. To begin with, people will have a routine, which will aid their time management. To elaborate, if we do not have a plan of activities to be carried out in the leisure time, we will spend a considerable amount of time wondering what to do. This would exhaust our available time. In addition to that, having a routine hobby such as playing sports or reading books will not only help us to pass our time but also improve our lives in all aspects. For instance, training routinely for a sport as a hobby will certainly make anyone an expert in that particular game.
However, considering the hectic schedules in the contemporary world, people have a greater need to rest and relax. As such having to plan for their leisure activities will add more stress to their already stressed out life. To cite an example, more often than not people work for 10 hours a day in my country. On top of this, if they had to plan and participate in a regular activity, it would certainly not help. Furthermore, pleasurable activities should not be time bound. Whenever time comes into the equation, it brings unwanted pressure.
To conclude, planning one’s pastime activity in detail certainly allows us to use the available time in the most efficient manner. Even so, in my opinion, it is better to indulge in an activity, which we prefer to do in that particular time without prior planning so that it will not add up any stress.",7.5,some-people-think-that-it-is-a-good-idea-to-have-a-detailed-plan-for-leisure-time-activities-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
879,"Differences between countries become less evident each year. Nowadays, all over the world people share the same fashions, advertising, brands, eating habits and TV channels. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of this?","It is undeniable that the world is now turned into a “Global Village”. One of its impacts is that people around the globe are exposed to the same products and services, and share similar habits. In my opinion, the advantages of this phenomenon outweigh the disadvantages.
Globalization certainly has had some impact on indigenous cultures of many countries. However, I believe that this impact is largely harmless and at the same time, it has exposed these cultures to other cultures around the world. This is a great opportunity to learn and evolve. Also an understanding of foreign cultures benefits one when one has to travel abroad for work leisure. In other words, people exposed to other cultures can interact confidently with the locals whenever they travel abroad. They are also less likely to get culture shocks. Secondly when everyone tends to have the same tastes in fashion or food, trade and tourism flourish. It creates more job opportunities. Also, when everyone looks and thinks alike, there are fewer chances for conflict. Wearing the same kind of clothes or eating the same kind of foods also protects people from many kinds of discrimination.
In addition to this, similarity in tastes helps both the consumers and the producers in the market. This is because manufacturers can sell their goods and services with ease in any part of the world. This could encourage healthy competition and avoid any kind of monopoly in the market. As a result, consumers have access to plenty of choices and at the same time, manufacturers are forced to improve the quality of their products.
In conclusion, although globalization has a small impact on customs and traditions, I firmly believe that it has improved the lifestyle of people all over the world by making quality products and services available everywhere. It also fosters understanding among people of different nations and ethnicities.",7.5,differences-between-countries-become-less-evident-each-year-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
880,In some parts of the world it is becoming popular to research the history of one’s own family. Why might people want to do this? Is it a positive or negative development?,"People are always curious to know about their past. They want to understand who their ancestors and what their ways of living were and whether they had any major events in their life. In my opinion, researching family history is largely a positive development.
In a way, it is always good to be aware of one’s past as it unfolds many mysteries which further gives answers to many unanswered questions. The primary reason to research the history of one’s own family is to discover the origin of one’s ancestors.
Since time immemorial people have been relocating due to education or work related reasons. Generation after generation people move from one place to another to meet their needs and during this course of changing places, the place of origin is forgotten. Sometimes children are given up for adoption immediately after they are born. They lose all contacts with their biological parents. Once they become adults, many of them try to discover their roots. For them this could be a therapeutic experience. For descendants of royal or aristocratic families, researching their roots could be an opportunity to inflate their ego. Also in many cultures it is very important to worship one’s own ancestors for prosperity and good health. Therefore, it becomes imperative to know the ancestors and their origin.
There are also some health related reasons to research family history. Many diseases are hereditary and it is important to know about diseases that run in families. This is particularly important for people who have lost touch with their parents or grandparents. By tracing the history of their family, they will be able to find out whether they are at risk of developing any particular disease.
To conclude, it is always beneficial to know about one’s own family history as it proves to be helpful in various ways. Some may be doing this out of sheer curiosity. Others may have a more valid reason to do so. In either case, there is no harm in discovering who one’s ancestors are.",7.5,in-some-parts-of-the-world-it-is-becoming-popular-to-research-the-history-of-ones-own-family-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
881,"Some people spend a lot of money for their wedding ceremonies. However, others feel like it is unnecessary to spend a lot. Discuss both view points and give your own opinion.","Some people prefer to have a lavish wedding and they do not mind spending a lot of money on it. Others opine that such celebrations are a waste of money. I agree with this view. In my opinion, one can save this money and utilise it for better purposes.
An elaborate / expensive wedding has many benefits. For example, it creates memories that the couple can remember for their life. It is also an opportunity for young people to celebrate their happiness with their friends and family. Consequently, many people spend too much money on this occasion to make it memorable and to show off their wealth and status. Moreover, such occasions give family members and friends an opportunity to get together.
On the flip side, a big wedding can also waste a lot more money. Couples can achieve better things in their life with this money. For example, they can invest it for their children’s education. There are some people who take loans to celebrate their marriage lavishly. They have to grapple with the debt for years to come and that will take away all the joy in their life.
Another disadvantage of lavish weddings is that they spur competition. When someone holds an extravagant wedding celebration for themselves or their children, their friends and neighbours will feel compelled to do so. This mentality will eventually lead to a lot of problems in the society.
To conclude, although many people believe that spending a lot of money for marriages would bring happiness and contentment, I personally think that such occasions are a waste of money. Saving this money for use in the future is a much better idea.",7.5,some-people-spend-a-lot-of-money-for-their-wedding-celebrations-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
882,Some people suggest that youngsters should follow the old people but others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Even today, there are many people who insist that young people should follow their elders such as their parents and grandparents. However, there are others who feel that youngsters should make their own decisions instead of following others. In my view, youngsters have the right to make their own decisions, but they should be guided by their parents.
Young people are more educated than their parents. They are more aware of the latest happenings in the world. They know what is trendy and what is not. However, they lack maturity. They also tend to make rash decisions. For this reason, youngsters should receive the guidance of their parents. If young people do whatever they want without listening to their parents, they are more likely to land themselves in trouble.
Having said that, if young people want to make their own decisions and choose a path that is different from that of their parents they should have the freedom to do so. Youngsters these days are better educated and have a decent understanding of the world. They know what they want to do with their life. For example, most young people know what they want to be in life. Likewise, they know which ideology they should believe in and who they want to live with. In my opinion, it is important for young people to make such life decisions. Parents should be there to guide them every step of the way. However, they must not force their children to follow them blindly.
In conclusion, there are certainly some benefits to following elders; however, in my opinion, youngsters are intelligent enough to make their own decisions regarding their life and career. It is the responsibility of parents to offer them guidance whenever they need it.",7.5,some-people-suggest-that-youngsters-should-follow-the-old-people-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
883,People spend too much money on family celebrations such as birthdays and weddings. What is the importance of these celebrations? Do you think people really spend too much?,"Since time immemorial celebrations have been an integral part of any culture. Celebrations on various occasions like birthdays and marriages not only reflect joy but also help to create unforgettable memories. Although the major purpose of celebrations is to get-together, a large amount of money is spent to make the entire event look extravagant.
Celebrations have always been a way of expressing happiness because that is the only time when the entire family and even the distant relatives get-together. In many cultures, celebrations also help the younger generations to understand rituals and traditions of their community. Different communities have different ways of celebrating rituals. For instance, in some cultures offering simple prayers in the temple are enough whereas in others grand offerings are made to the priests along with meal arrangements for the guests in attendance.
Unfortunately, people these days are moving away from the main motive of celebration and trying to show off their wealth. Celebrations have become more of a show biz as people try to find out creative ways to make their celebrations stand out and this involves a lot of money. They want to show that they are superior to others and this has further converted the events into a big business. Although a lot of people get employment out of this phenomenon, one needs to see the way money is being spent.
Celebrations can be enjoyed even if kept simple as they are more of a family affair. But people seem to be mixing it up with their prestige in the society. We should understand that people have more disposable income these days but it is high time that they wake up to the importance of saving money and using it for more fruitful ways.",7.5,people-spend-too-much-money-on-family-celebrations-such-as-birthdays-and-weddings-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
884,"Employers sometimes ask people applying for jobs for personal information, such as their hobbies and interests, and whether they are married or single. Some people say that this information may be relevant and useful. Others disagree. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","These days the recruitment process of some multinational companies involves answering various questions related to the candidate’s personal and professional data. Many people opine that too many personal questions are being asked and they do not feel the need to answer them, whilst some others do not find any harm in answering such questions. I agree with the latter group, as I think that giving some general information would not pose any serious problems.
Firstly, general information is asked by the human resources department the big companies to identify the inherent and hidden talents of the employees and to provide them the right platform to showcase their talents. For instance, in my firm during the annual parties and celebrations the HR team contacts the amateur singers and dancers from among the employees using the information they provided during the interviews. Getting an opportunity to perform before their colleagues boosts the confidence of employees and makes them feel appreciated / rewarded. This makes the people feel they are valued and important at their workplace and eventually increase their productivity.
On the contrary, some people are introvert by nature, or may be too cautious when it comes to their personal data. They are worried that their information could be leaked. Moreover, a few others may think that their personal hobbies may affect their chances of securing a job as these hobbies may alter employer’s decision. However, I strongly believe that these trivial things will in no way hurt your employment prospects if you do well in the interview.
To conclude, even though some people may object to sharing their personal data with firms citing security issues and/ or due to their reserved nature, I am of the opinion that sharing our favorite pastime information with our employer would do us more good than harm. It will let people know more about us and give us more space to improve our extra-curricular talents.",7.5,employers-sometimes-ask-people-applying-for-jobs-for-personal-information-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
885,Learning to play team sports is an important part of child’s education. Do you agree or disagree? Include relevant examples from your own experience.,"Sports which are played in teams play a vital role in the overall development of children. These sports activities are essential for the child’s personality development as they learn teamwork and coordination. Therefore, I totally agree with the argument children must play team sports for educational and personal growth.
First and foremost, when children play a team game, they learn to cooperate. In other words, each player in the team is assigned a set of responsibilities to achieve a common goal and their teammates are bound to cooperate to achieve a common goal. The same rules apply when students work on an academic project. Each student is assigned with the task such as presentation and documentation. They share thoughts with one another and finish the project to the best of their ability. This enables them to obtain good grades. Therefore, the knowledge that a child acquires via team sports is pivotal in education.
Secondly, sports which are played in groups tend to be more challenging and require techniques. These technicalities help in the brain development of a child and enhance the ability to think out of the box. For instance, a student who plays cricket can have higher logical abilities / skills as he decides what shot he should play under different fielding criteria to win the game. In addition, learning these skills produces the leadership qualities in the person which one can utilize at career stage.
To conclude, team sports provide an environment where a student can learn group work strategies which help their physical and mental development. Thus it is recommended that students play / should play team sports.",7.5,learning-to-play-team-sports-is-an-important-part-of-education-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
886,More and more women go out to work. Is it the government’s responsibility to subsidise them and provide free staff and facilities to care for their children? To what extent do you agree or disagree with this idea?,"One of the biggest challenges that working women face is finding a good support system for their children. Since they contribute to the economic development of the country, some people insist that the government should provide free or subsidized childcare facilities for the benefit of these women and their children. I agree with this view.
One of the main reasons that discourage young mothers from taking up employment is the lack of a good support system for their children. While there are so many private childcare centres in cities, they often charge exorbitant fees that poor and middle class families cannot afford. Consequently, many young mothers choose not to work. If the government provides free childcare facilities more women will be willing to work and this will have a tremendously positive impact on the economy of the nation.
The government should build such facilities in all cities and towns. It should also talk to private companies and build childcare centres on their premises for the welfare of their female employees. When there are such centres on the campus, female employees can take short occasional breaks to feed their babies. Another advantage of opening such centres is that young mothers can work without having to take frequent leaves of absence. When children fall ill, mothers often take days off from work. If they have the assurance that there are trained people to take care of their babies when they are ill, they will be able to attend office without fail. This will encourage more employers to hire them.
To conclude, I agree with the argument that the government should offer subsidies and build day care facilities for the children of working parents. Working women contribute to the development of the country and the government has a responsibility to make life less stressful for them by providing them free staff and child care facilities.",7.5,more-and-more-go-out-to-work-should-the-government-provide-free-staff-and-facilities-to-care-for-their-children-band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample
887,"In many countries, people decide to have a child at a later age. Why is this? Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","In the modern society, many couples have delayed parenthood unlike in the past. There are some reasons behind this trend, and i strongly believe that there are for more drawbacks than benefits to this development.
To begin with, a few reasons can be given to justify the trend of giving birth at later stages of life. First, the labour market is becoming competitive and it is quite normal that parents decide not to have a child during the early years of their marriage. In other words, as  women start to pursue higher studies and enter the workforce, they tend to delay their marriage  and have children later in their life; they cannot balance family and work due to the responsibilities of childbearing and parenting. Second, some couples do not want to sacrifice their social life by having children when they are young. To be more precise, having children during the initial years of their marriage will deprive them of the opportunity to enjoy life as they want. For example, the majority of young couples prefer travelling and enjoying their life to sitting at home and raising their children
On the other hand, I feel that there are several negative effects to this trend. First, delaying pregnancy can lead to some health complications. Fertility starts to decline after the age of thirty, and babies born after this age can have higher risk of health conditions such as Down`s syndrome and other genetic birth defects. Second, having a child later can cause a significant age gap between the two generations and this will make it harder for parents to communicate with their children. Besides, it will be financially demanding for parents to send their young children to colleges or universities when they are close to retirement or universities, and this could mean delayed or difficult retirement for parents.
To conclude, People prefer having children later in life because they want to improve their career and enjoy their social life; however, I strongly believe that the demerits of this development far outweigh the merits.",7.5,in-many-countries-couples-decide-to-have-a-child-at-an-advanced-age-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
888,In many countries the tradition of families having meals together is disappearing. Why is this happening? What will be the effect of it on the family and society?,"In most regions of the world, the ritual of having meals with family is fading away. This situation is a consequence of the busy schedule and globalization. I believe that this situation is not good for people and leads to disintegrated and unhealthy families.
To start with, the major reason why families are unable to have meals together is the busy schedule and aspirations of the current generation. People in current times are very competitive and aspire to have high profile lives. Consequently, they take up highly paid jobs and end up having a busy lifestyle / schedule. Secondly, addiction to social media has led to a situation where people are only interested in their virtual friends. This also leaves them with no time for their family. Finally, people in this global world coordinate and work with teams located in different time zones leading to changes in lifestyle and mealtimes.
The above situation has led to detrimental effects on the family life. The most vulnerable members of the family are children and they start to disassociate themselves with the family and lose their appetite as a result. Children in current times have their meals in school with no family members, which have a lot of psychological impact on their mental health. Secondly, it leads to people having quick breaks with no proper meals with the family. Furthermore, it results in a situation where people get affected with diseases   like diabetes, acidity and other digestive imbalances.
To conclude, people are no longer having meals with their families because of their busy lifestyle and addiction to visual media.

889,Some people say that parents should encourage their children to take part in organised group activities in their free time. Others say that it is important for children to learn how to occupy themselves on their own. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.,"A child’s mind is like a piece of clay that can be moulded into any desirable form. Leisure time is a great opportunity for children to acquire useful skills and to entertain themselves. Perhaps due to this, some parents are encouraging organised activities for children while others believe in letting their children occupy themselves in their own way. I feel that children’s participation in team building activities would keep them fruitfully engaged. It will also prepare them for handling multiple endeavours in the future.
Playing regular sports such as cricket, football, and badminton or attending art classes to learn musical instruments, singing, and dancing sounds productive. Children busy with these scheduled pastimes would be less prone to spend long hours on TV, phones or the internet. Additionally, they might discover their passion while pursuing these arranged activities.
On the other side, some people would like to leave it up to the children to follow their interests. A free and non-coercive environment could foster creative abilities in children. For example, activities such as building a castle in the sand or crafting a prototype of a bus, train or animals foster creativity in children. Moreover, the instructive nature of sorted sessions may not interest everyone and leave them with minimal or no time for relaxation.
In my opinion, I feel children should be motivated to pursue systemized undertakings in their idle time. However, they should be spared some time to ponder and tinker with things around and nurture their own hobbies.

890,"Some people say that working couples must equally share the household responsibility in all cultures across the world. However, others simply do not agree with this view. What side of the given views do you agree with?","There is no doubt that in the fast paced life responsibilities of a couple have increased. Some people think that the couples who work should be equally responsible for the domestic chores; whereas, others believe that the responsibility of husband and wife should vary. In my opinion, it is important for the working couples to equally share the duties of the household.
There are many reasons why I agree with the people who are of the view that the household duties should be equally divided among the working couples. Firstly, sharing responsibility creates happiness and strong family ties as the burden of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is not the responsibility of only one person. Nowadays, expenses have increased due to the change in the lifestyle; thus, putting the whole responsibility on a single shoulder is totally unethical. Secondly, sharing duties leads to a stress free life for both the husband and the wife. For instance, working couples can enjoy a better lifestyle because of the double income.
On the other hand, there are people who believe that domestic chores are the responsibility of a woman even if she works outside of the home. This opinion stems from the age old belief that men are not responsible for cooking, cleaning or raising children. It made perfect sense in the olden days when men were the only bread winners and women confined themselves to their home. In this day and age when both the husband and the wife work this mentality cannot be encouraged.
In conclusion, it is crucial for the working couples to share household duties because it simply is not possible for a woman to have a full time job and still manage all household duties on her own. Therefore, sharing the household responsibilities is imperative if the couples want to enjoy a happy family life and financial freedom.",7.5,some-people-say-that-working-couples-must-share-household-responsibilities-equally-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
891,Some students work while studying. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this trend and give your opinion?,"There are lots of youngsters who work part time while they are still at school.  Working part-time early on helps students to gain real world experiences but this also prevent them from getting involved in various extra-curricular activities at school. This essay explores the advantages and disadvantages of working part time.
Working while in high school offers various advantages to the students. They gain real world experiences very early on and learn how to manage the time between work and school, which is a very important skill to master for future successes. The exposure to the workplace helps them build their character and discover their strengths. Working outside gives them an opportunity to meet with various people and handle difficult circumstances.
On the flip side, there are an equal number of disadvantages to working part time. Working part time means students have to manage both work and studies. This may hurt their focus and affect their performance. For example, they might have an important exam at school and a stressful situation at work simultaneously. In such situations it becomes very hard to concentrate on either of them. By contrast, a student who does not work part time is more likely to do better in their exam. Students who work also regularly miss out on various extra-curricular activities or playtime with friends. These can impact social bonding with their peers.
To conclude, working while studying definitely has advantages that help students to succeed in life; however, these children also miss out on a lot of activities that their peers engage in. It is recommended that children should understand both sides of the situation before choosing to work while they are still at school.",7.5,advantages-and-disadvantages-of-working-while-studying-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
892,"Employers sometimes ask people applying for jobs for personal information, such as their hobbies and interests, and whether they are married or single. Some people say that this information may be relevant and useful. Others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Companies are ditching the traditional method of selecting candidates. They are looking beyond the core job competencies. Employers are collecting personal data on interests, hobbies and marital statuses. In my opinion, such information can be useful for the employer; however, there is a possibility of its being misused.
One of the crucial reasons of obtaining personal information is to align the organization’s vision with that of the candidate’s goals. In other words, it is a way of figuring out whether the potential candidate is a right fit. To illustrate further, an applicant who pursues painting or graphic designing as a hobby may add value to the innovative framework / creative department of a company. Pastime interest in organising community events, conducting open forums and sessions could make a candidate more suitable for the role of an Event Manager. Furthermore, avocations such as mountaineering, sports, and fitness with some achievement records could imply attributes of perseverance and diligence. Leisure undertakings of exploring different places, photography and meeting new people could make one’s candidature favourable in the tourism industry.
There is another school of thought that does not support the idea of harvesting personal data. This is due to the unreliability of the data furnished by job seekers. For instance, one of the job surveys revealed that around 40% of the applicants record fake hobbies on their resumes. Most of which are often borrowed from standard templates on the net. Sometimes, there is a possibility that the employers could use the personal information against the employee. For example, in the case of female candidates if she is recently married, they may refuse to hire her because of her chances of becoming pregnant in the near future.
In conclusion, I feel employers can get some valuable insight from the personal information of prospective candidates. The practice of obtaining personal information can be beneficial in the long run.

While I agree with this idea to a great extent, I also believe that many aspects of the life were better in the past.
Without a doubt, life is a lot better now. A good example of this is the greater longevity that humans enjoy today. This means people spend much longer on the planet as compared to their ancestors. Much of the global population has access to improved health care systems and education. People are much more informed about the importance of sanitation and this also adds years to their life.
The quality of life has also improved over the decades. There have been no major wars in the last 50 years. People spend more time with family now than before. There are new methods of entertainment. As the world has seen the shift from the industrial revolution to service industries, more people are now free during the weekends, when they can enjoy these new modes of entertainment. With globalization, almost every corner of the planet has become accessible and each year has seen an increase in the number of tourists around the world. Globalization has also enabled people to access technologies from around the world. These technologies can be used for entertainment, productivity or relaxation. Because of the aforementioned facts, we can definitely say that the life has changed in last 100 years for the betterment of the people.
However, there is a downside to this progress. The quality of water and air has decreased over the years because of pollution. Many species of birds and animals have disappeared from the planet due to human activity.
To conclude, life has improved greatly as human race has made significant progress in most aspects of the life in the last 100 years. However, the same advancements have also adversely affected our life and planet in the form of pollution, contamination, and global warming.

894,Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reason why someone should learn a foreign language. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"Although it is sometimes thought by many people that a foreign language is only used when they travel or work in a different country, other people have a contrasting view as they think that there are much more benefits to learning a second language. In my opinion, a person can gain a lot if they know how to communicate in a foreign language.
On the other hand, some people think that they should learn a foreign language only if they decide / choose to live in a foreign country. Of course, knowledge of a foreign language is beneficial in such situations because this enables the visitor / migrant to communicate more effectively when they are abroad. For instance, someone travelling to China for work from a non-Chinese speaking state must know how to interact with locals and co-workers. Furthermore, knowing their language will make them feel comfortable at a stranger place.
However, in my opinion, the reasons for learning a non-native language should not be limited to work or travel purposes as a lot more can be achieved by mastering a foreign language.  Firstly, knowing a second / foreign language will enable someone to understand the diverse culture and the traditional aspects of the country where it is the mother tongue. For example, the language is considered as a gateway to a nation’s culture and traditions. Secondly, many studies have shown that children who can speak a second or third language have far better cognitive development than children who can speak only one language. Finally, knowing a different language can also enable people to read more books or content available over the internet and socialise with people without travelling to that country.
To conclude, people may have different opinions, but I believe that the benefits of learning a foreign language are not limited to work or travel. Acquisition of a foreign language helps with brain development.

895,Some people think that the only way to judge someone’s success in business is by the amount of money they make. Is this a true indicator of the success of a business and in what other ways could success in a business be measured?,"Many people strive hard to be successful in business. There are many indicators of a successful business. A business that reaps more profits is generally thought to be more successful, but in my opinion, money is not the only parameter of success.
Firstly, it must be agreed upon that making money is one of the primary motives behind starting any new business. Every individual wants to make a good deal of profits out of his investment. Also, a company’s annual profits are very important to pull in other investors into that business and thus achieve its expansion and growth. So, there is no question about money being one of the indicators of success. Having said that, money is not the only measure / indicator of success.
There are other important indicators of a successful business. First comes employee satisfaction. A business may make huge amounts of money but if its employees are unhappy, it is worthless. Also, employee unhappiness will eventually lead to the failure of a company. Secondly, earning name and fame is more important than making money. There are many businessmen who earn respect in the society irrespective of their business turnovers. This is because of the trust they have built over years. Last but not least, customer satisfaction is also an important measure of a successful business.
To conclude, even though profits are an important indicator of success, in my opinion, the reputation and goodwill that a company enjoys are equally if not more important. After all, only a business that earns the loyalty of its employees and customers can stay profitable in the long term.",7.5,some-people-think-that-the-only-way-to-judge-someones-success-in-business-is-by-the-amount-of-money-they-make-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
896,"Some people are happy to spend the whole of their life living in the same area. However, others prefer to live in many different areas over their lifetime. Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","Some people feel blessed and cheerful when they get an opportunity to live in various parts of the world; however, others are happy to live in the same place for their life. In my opinion, it is important to learn about different cultures and places to make our life joyful.
On the one hand, people choose to migrate from one place to another as they are keen to learn and acquire knowledge about different cultural aspects and lifestyle. Moreover, exploring various lands and meeting people from different cultural backgrounds is the hobby of many people. Professionals who lack exciting opportunities in their own country are likely to migrate to places where there is a demand for skilled people like them.
On the other hand, there are many people who prefer to reside in one area only. This is because they do not want to leave their comfort zone as many formalities and arrangements are required if shifting is involved. Furthermore, family oriented people opt to live within the joint families because they prefer the proximity of family to better career opportunities. For instance, in India, many people live in their ancestral homes as they feel blissful residing in them.
In conclusion, there are merits and demerits to staying in one place and frequently changing the place of residence. In my opinion, people who seek newer experiences and challenges are the ones who keep moving from place to place. Those who love comfort and familiarity will most probably live in the same place throughout their lives.",7.5,some-people-are-happy-to-spend-the-whole-of-their-life-living-in-the-same-area-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
897,The large number of private cars on the roads in many parts of the world has led to serious problems of pollution and may contribute to global warming. Some people think that governments should spend money for the development of public transportation systems in order to help solve this problem. Others think it is better to spend money for the development of electric and other types of cars that may cause less pollution. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.,"Over the years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of personal vehicles on roads. They have polluted the air and caused global warming. Some people argue that in order to solve this issue, the government should spend more money on public transportation; others opine that investing in electric cars is even better. In my opinion, investing in public transport is the best short term solution. A permanent solution is to adopt electric cars.
There are many studies that suggest that investing in public transportation is better for society. To start with, it significantly reduces the number of cars on the road, which in turn translates to less traffic congestion and shorter time to reach destination. Travelling on public transportation, such as buses and trains increases the productivity of a person. People can work on their projects, assignments or invest this time in learning new skills. This time would have been wasted if they had chosen to drive a personal vehicle. Investing in mass transit also means creating new jobs for the community. Thus, not only does it improve the personal life of commuters but it also helps to create a thriving community.
Spending money on the development of electric cars and other green alternatives, however, is not of any less significance. Electric cars have zero emission, which tremendously helps the planet. Significant investment in these types of vehicles is of utmost) priority, especially since we are now living on the brink of an environmental disaster). With such efforts, not only are we saving the planet, but we are also helping the human race as a whole.
In my opinion, investing  in public transportation is  the current need of the society. Electric and other green vehicles are equally important but since their research and development are still in the nascent stage, it will be a while for them to become widely popular. They are not as affordable as their fossil fuel counterparts yet. If we invest in public transportation, we can realize the effects almost instantaneously. This will help the environment in the present and once electric vehicles become more popular and affordable they too will have a significant positive impact on the overall health of the planet.",7.5,in-order-to-solve-traffic-problems-and-air-pollution-the-government-should-invest-in-public-transport-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
898,Many museums and historical sites are mainly visited by tourists rather than local people. Why is this? What can be done to encourage local people to visit museums and historical sites?,"It is true that many museums and historical sites are visited by tourists, and not local people who live there. There are several reasons for this situation. In this essay, we will discuss the reasons for this situation and suggest a range or measures that we can take to fix this issue.
One of the main reasons is that these museums and historical sites are always busy and also expensive to visit. For example, I live in Washington areas where there are several museums. These museums require reservation which need to be booked two or three months prior to the visit date. Also, these museums cost more than fifty dollars per person per visit. Another reason is the lack of awareness about these museums & historical places among local population. Local population in general may not know the prominence of these museums and sites while tourists who are coming from other places are in general curious about the places they are visiting. For example, one of my friends visited the place where I live and we started visiting the museums.
To fix these problems, museums should reserve some of the entry tickets to local people which will make it more convenient for the locals. Another solution is to reduce the ticket price to locals. This reduction in price will make these visits attractive to local people who are price sensitive. Another solution is to promote these museums as attractive weekend destinations among long people. Governments should also allocate more funds to carefully maintain and preserve these structures and make more attractive and useful to local people.
In conclusion, tourists have different interests than local people and museums concentrate more on tourists than local people. That being said the above mentioned solutions like price concessions and reserving some tickets to local people and creating awareness can encourage more local people to visit museums.",7.5,many-museums-are-visited-by-tourists-not-local-people-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
899,"Some people believe that academic subjects such as chemistry, physics and history should be taught in schools, while others believe that students will derive more benefit from studying practical subjects, such as motor mechanics and cooking. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.","Some people insist / opine that the school curriculum should give more importance to academic subjects like history or physics, while others argue that the emphasis should be on imparting practical skills. In my opinion, subjects such as science, mathematics and history prepare children for a brighter future and hence they should be given more importance.
On the one hand, there is ample evidence to prove that children are interested in practical skills. To begin with, these skills may help them make a little amount of money to fulfil their small needs and wishes. Furthermore, learning practical skills such as cooking, or carpentry is fun because the output can be seen and appreciated almost instantly. For example, in a recent survey done by the sophomores of Florida University, 65% of parents of school going children admitted that their young kids enjoy learning practical skills more than academic subjects. However, learning academic subjects leads to better career prospects in future.
On the other hand, during the past decade, job market surveys emphasized the importance of having professional skills. Firstly, scientists and technologists are paid far better than the people doing lower level jobs. In other words, this means that well educated people live more comfortable lives than those who lack it. Secondly, there is a huge demand for professionals in all fields in comparison to the saturated market of blue collar jobs and workers. It goes without saying that if children are encouraged to pursue academic subjects with more interest then they will witness a brighter future.
To conclude, practical skills may interest children in their initial stage of life but to have better opportunities and happiness in life they will need to master academic subjects.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-children-should-study-academic-subjects-at-school-others-believe-that-practical-subjects-are-more-important-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
900,"Teenagers are spending an increasing amount of time on the Internet, and this is having a negative effect on their social skills. Do you agree or disagree?","The internet has revolutionized the life of the modern man. These days, adolescents are mostly seen using the online service excessively and it is believed that it is negatively affecting their social skills. In my opinion, this belief is true but this problem can be resolved if teenagers are guided properly by their parents and educators.
There are myriads of reasons why usage of the internet is detrimental for children. Firstly, most of their time is being spent sitting on computer either doing some assignment or surfing the social networking sites which certainly isolates them from their family members. Secondly, their involvement in social events is minimal / negligible owing to their interest in making online foreign friends; thus, they remain inactive in their local surroundings. Thirdly, they usually lack in the communication skills as they persistently live in their virtual world.
However, the negative influence of the internet can be reduced if elders constantly monitor the activities of their children and advise them about the demerits of being online for long hours. Parents should devote time to their adolescence child; subsequently, it is better to form a timetable for their children and make sure that they adhere to the healthy lifestyle. Moreover, parents can even participate in leisurely activities along with their children to motivate them to remain socially active.
In conclusion, although the internet has generally had a positive impact on all spheres of life, it can be harmful for young people because they are using it to an extreme degree which prevents from being active in their local community. However, parents and teachers can improve the situation to a great extent by teaching youngsters about the downside of spending too much time online.",7.5,teenagers-are-spending-an-increasing-amount-of-time-on-the-internet-and-this-is-having-a-negative-impact-on-their-social-skills-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
901,"In many countries, schoolchildren are required to wear school uniforms. Do you think this should be enforced in all schools?","It is often believed that a uniform helps create a disciplined atmosphere at school. I agree with this view. In my opinion, students should be required to wear uniform because of the many benefits offered by it.
There are many reasons why uniform is important in schools. Firstly, it creates a positive environment in schools; consequently, the decorum of school is maintained efficiently as poor children are not bullied on the basis of their clothes. This also eradicates any disparity between rich and poor students. Thus, a happy environment is created.
Another point is that the uniform enables children to concentrate more on studies rather than on their wardrobe. When they do not have to worry about what to wear to school, they can work to achieve their goals. Moreover, parents’ hard earned money is saved as children are supposed to abide by uniforms. For instance, many parents are happy to send their children to schools where uniform is compulsory.
Nevertheless, despite the benefits, there are certain minor drawbacks. For instance, standard size uniforms may not be comfortable for obese children. However, those children can get their uniform stitched by a tailor. Another minor issue is that students may get tired of wearing the same piece of clothing every day; however, this problem can be resolved by having different uniforms on different days.
In conclusion, uniform makes it easy to maintain discipline at school and create an atmosphere of equality. Enforcing a rule that requires students to abide by a dress code has more advantages than disadvantages.",7.5,do-you-think-uniform-should-be-enforced-in-all-schools-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
902,Some people say that the reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"In the modern world, boundary lines between countries are becoming thinner thanks to newer communication technologies and open trade practices. While some people are of the opinion that the main purpose of learning a foreign language is to work or travel abroad, I believe that the reasons go beyond that.
On the one hand, people who travel to live in foreign countries usually learn the language of their host in order to have smooth integration and interaction with locals in the country. In addition, international students are often required to learn a foreign language especially if that is the language of instruction in the institution of learning. For instance, Chinese students are required to learn English language before they can be admitted into universities in the United Kingdom. Another reason for learning a foreign language is that it would help immigrants secure employment faster.
On the other hand, the need to learn / master a foreign language extends far beyond travel and employment reasons. Firstly, learning a foreign language is the easiest way to understand the culture, traditions and reasoning of the people who speak it. In addition, recent advancement in technology has made trade and commercial activities between various countries easier through the internet. For example, a retailer in Nigeria can interact with and order goods from production companies in China. Such transactions necessitate the learning of the foreign language.
In conclusion, learning a second language is the key to an endless world of opportunities for people looking to work or travel abroad as well as for those who prefer to stay in their own country.",7.5,the-only-reason-for-learning-a-foreign-language-is-to-travel-or-work-in-a-foreign-country-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
903,"By punishing murderers with the death penalty, society is also guilty of committing murder. Therefore, life in prison is a better punishment for murderers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Over the years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people who commit heinous crimes like murder or rape. Some people insist that criminals convicted of serious crimes should be given the capital punishment; others argue that putting them behind the bar for life is a better approach. I agree with the latter view because in my opinion, neither people nor judiciary has the right to take a person’s life.
To start with, people who demand capital punishment are of the opinion that it will act as a deterrent and instill fear in the minds of potential offenders. However, studies conducted on this topic have shown that the severity of the punishment has nothing to do with its being a deterrent. Rather, it depends on how fast the criminal is booked and the sentence is pronounced. In many countries it takes years for the judiciary to pronounce the verdict. This delay in awarding the sentence encourages more people to commit crimes. Also the capital punishment simply eliminates the offender from this world. It does not give them an opportunity to reform themselves. Therefore, in my opinion, the death penalty is barbaric and should be done with. Instead, the law should prefer life imprisonment.
Life in prison, on the other hand, may serve its purpose of reforming the offender by giving them an opportunity to reflect on their act and live in guilt. Each and Every one should be given second chance. We must not forget that when the law takes the life of a murderer, it is also stooping to the level of that convict.
In conclusion, criminals should be quickly brought to book for their crimes but capital punishment is not an answer for this. Life Imprisonment not only punishes offenders but also gives them a second chance to reflect on their act and mend their ways.",7.5,by-punishing-murderers-with-death-penalty-society-is-also-guilty-of-committing-murder-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
904,The restoration of old buildings in major cities around the world costs enormous amounts of money. This money would be better spent on providing new housing and road development. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, a significant amount of money is spent on the maintenance of old structures in many cities. Some people believe that the same amount may be utilized for other infrastructure projects instead of the above. I disagree with this view. In this essay, I shall explain why the budget to be spent for preserving and maintaining old buildings and monuments of cities should not be curtailed.
The road side buildings in old cities are usually stone structures that represent the culture and heritage of that place. Many of them are in poor condition. Even so, in my opinion, they should be restored because these buildings are strongly attached to the history of the city. If they are demolished, a part of the history will also die out and it is a national loss. On the other hand, maintaining buildings of historical value in good condition is a great way to bring tourism to the city. The tourism generates new employment opportunities and revenue. A part of this revenue may be utilized for new infrastructure projects like better highway connectivity, new housing schemes etc. These infrastructure projects may also provide a hassle-free experience to the city tourists. For example, good metro train connectivity to the oldest part of heavily populated city will ensure better infrastructure and it will promote tourism as well.
Having said that, those buildings that are beyond repair should definitely be demolished and new structures should be built in their place. Allowing them to stay in their dilapidated state poses serious threat to life and property.
To conclude, old structures and monuments tell us about the history and time-journey of the city. Their maintenance and preservation shall enhance the reputation of the city and create employment opportunities and revenue. Even so, buildings that cannot be restored should be destroyed.",7.5,the-restoration-of-old-buildings-cost-enormous-amounts-of-money-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
905,Young people’s ideas and attitudes are different from those of their parents and grandparents. What are the differences? What problems may be caused?,"No doubt ideas and attitudes towards some aspects change with age. Sometimes it creates conflicts between two generations and there are a lot of problems due to this, which I am going to discuss in the upcoming paragraphs.
To embark upon, when a person grows old it is but natural that his thoughts change. For example, when we were kids many of us refused to eat green vegetables. As we grew older and learned about the benefits of veggies, we started eating them. Other differences are about the choices of younger and older ones. For instance, while youngsters like to wear bright coloured clothes, seniors prefer light colours. Likewise, young people can be quite rash but seniors think twice before taking decisions. Often times parents want to impose their beliefs and value systems on their children while the kids want to follow the global culture. They want to follow the latest trends. Moreover, parents force children to choose career of their choice, but children like to walk on the untrodden path and explore more opportunities in that direction.
All the differences mentioned above are the causes of many problems. First, children start disobeying their parents  and ignore their valuable guidance and land themselves in trouble. They are of the view that parents belong to older generation and cannot understand their problems and issues. The second problem is that youngsters leave their parents due to these generation gaps and to pursue their profession. This in turn is detrimental for both parents and youngsters. Both of them start living monotonous lives and are deprived of the much wanted love and affection. What’s more, this deprivation increases their stress levels and stress is the root cause of many heath related issues.
To conclude, generation gap cannot be wished away; however, it can be bridged to a great extent if parents and children try to understand each other’s perspectives.",7.5,young-peoples-ideas-and-attitudes-are-different-from-those-of-their-parents-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
906,Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?,"Traffic congestion and pollution have become major problems worldwide. Pollution is particularly worse in the big cities. While it is possible that higher petrol prices will solve the traffic and pollution problems to a great extent, raising the price of oil is not the best solution. However, I believe that other measures are more effective.
The main reason why raising the fuel prices is not the right solution is that it is the short-term measure. Although it might cut the number of vehicles on the road, it largely affects the prices of food and other goods. For instance, in India, my home country, everything relies on the transport. If petrol prices increase, the prices of commodities in the market will also increase. This will lead to inflation in the market which has a big domino impact on what people end up paying even for a slice of bread.
A better solution is to find measures that will work in the long run. To illustrate, escalating the investment in alternative fuels and improving public transport are more effective measures than increasing petrol prices. Traffic and pollution problems will not be solved until people start using the public transport. For this reason, the government should make public transport available at cheap rates and prohibit cars from city centres.
To conclude, this essay discussed how the growing population and worsening air quality have made it imperative for governments and people to adopt change and cut the use of private transport. However, in my opinion, increasing the cost of petrol is not the right solution for traffic congestion. Instead of taking this drastic measure, governments should invest in public transport and clean fuel.",7.5,increasing-the-price-of-petrol-is-the-best-way-to-solve-traffic-problems-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
907,Some people think that international competitive sports such as football create conflicts between people of different age groups and nationalities. Others think sport is helping reach understanding between people and nations. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The issue of whether or not international sports events should be continued has sparked a heated debate. While skeptics hold the notion that such events lead to disagreements among people of different nationalities, others insist that they foster good will. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in depth and express my opinion.
Sporting events like Olympics and football world cup are full of action and energy. At times, it is irresistible for the supporters to get into a fight or an argument while supporting their teams. Often such acts create a hostile atmosphere for the neutral crowd. Moreover, sometimes these events divide the people based on their age, caste, creed and nationality. This is detrimental for the welfare of the world and civilized societies. For instance, during the recently held Common Wealth Games, fans of Chinese and Australian teams passed rather disgracing comments on one another. It is for these reasons that sporting events sometimes face criticism.
Conversely, games are the only platform where people of different nationalities can come together. The events like Asian Games not only bring people together from all walks of life but also help them to understand and respect people from different nations. Furthermore, these events are extremely effective at cementing the bilateral relationship. For instance, the cricket matches between India and Pakistan have been more successful / effective at improving the strained relationships between the two countries than government talks. What’s more, in many cases, popular teams have fans all over the world. For example, the football teams of Brazil and Argentina have millions of followers outside of their country. Such show of admiration and support actually help to bridge the gap between cultures and nations.
To conclude, international sporting events can certainly lead to some tension between fans of different teams. Even so, in my opinion, they are also good at cementing relationships because sports, after all, are a celebration of the human endurance and the best teams have fans all over the world. Thus, sporting events foster harmony and understanding among nations.",7.5,some-people-think-that-international-sporting-events-create-conflicts-between-people-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
908,Some people think that the only way to judge someone’s success in business is by the amount of money they make. Is this a true indicator of the success of a business and in what other ways could success in a business be measured?,"Everyone wants to become successful in life and business. Nowadays, many people believe that money is the only parameter to measure success in business. I strongly disagree with this view and believe that the revenue generated cannot be the only indicator of the success of an industry or organization. There are multiple other factors which must be taken into consideration while analyzing the success of an industry. In this essay, I shall explain why money cannot be the only criterion of success and also mention some other indicators of success.
Money is crucial for running a business and it plays a major role in improving the viability of a business. However, money alone cannot create a strong foundation for a business. The reputation of an industry or an organization among its consumers is more important than the profit. Profit may be the number one concern of short term businesses but for a business that is supposed to last years or decades, goodwill is more important.
For example, the valuation of the e-commerce website Flipkart, which was one of the highest loss making organizations in the previous financial year is more than that of many profit making companies. That is because Flipkart has a large customer base and also it is a name that customers trust. In other words, the net profit is not a measure of the market value or potential of a business. By contrast, factors such as a strong customer base, good reputation, quality products and loyal employees and customers are better indicators of the success of a company. For example, many companies price their products aggressively for grabbing large market share. Despite suffering loss, these companies have loyal customers and a high global rating.
To conclude, profit cannot be the single deciding factor of the success of an organization. There are a plethora of other factors for judging the success of a business and they include the customer base and reputation of the company.",7.5,some-people-think-that-money-is-the-only-measure-of-the-success-of-a-business-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
909,Some people argue that competitive sports are for bringing together different people and cultures others argue that these sports can cause problems and increase conflicts between nations. Discuss both point of views and give your opinion.,"Competitive sports attract audience from different nations and cultures. While some believe that such occasions promote unity among people of different cultures and nationalities, others fear that they lead to the escalation of tension among people. In my opinion sports always spread love and foster brotherhood among people irrespective of their nationality.
Every year teams from different countries play competitive sports in global tournaments. The popularity of these events make people visit stadiums to watch them live. People supporting their national teams are root for their team’s victory. Even then they respect their opposition team and their supporters. People enjoy the competitive nature of the game and simultaneously interact with their opponents. This interaction between the people of different cultures is of mutual respect and admiration. FIFA Football world cup, for instance, sees stiff competition between arch rivals and their supporters are seen enjoying the game with their counterparts. Thus, it is evident that people of different origins come together to enjoy and amalgamate at these events.
There are, however, many people who are wary of competitive sports and its after effects. They opine that competitive spirits in the high stake games raise tempers of the supporters of the losing team. As the emotions run high during such games there is every chance that serious altercations can occur between supporters of different teams. Sometimes emotional outburst is so phenomenal that tensions can even lead to a diplomatic crisis between the two nations. An India Pakistan cricket match, for example, is watched with fervor by the people of both the nations. It is always feared that this game might raise conflicts between two nations and aggravate their strained ties.
In conclusion, in my opinion, frequent exposure to such competitive games eases the pressure associated with them and creates the atmosphere of bonding and affection between people with different backgrounds.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-competitive-sports-can-cause-conflicts-between-nations-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
910,"As a result of tourism and the increasing number of people travelling, there is a growing demand for more flights. What problems does this have on the environment? What measures could be taken to solve this problem","Over the recent years, international tourism has seen a significant growth across the globe. This has resulted in an increasing demand for flights which has adversely affected the environment. In this essay, I intend to outline the major problems caused by this phenomenon and suggest a few measures to solve this issue.
One of the major problems with growing demand for flights is air pollution. This is because air-crafts emit an inordinate amount of exhaust fumes and toxic gases which contaminate the air. This could result in other catastrophic events such as acid rain which in turn causes soil pollution. Additionally, air pollution tends to disturb the natural ecosystem of birds and other species. Therefore, it is undeniable that an increasing number of flights has a negative impact on the environment.
Fortunately, there are a number of measures that can be taken in-order to mitigate this issue. Firstly, the government should actively promote the use of green energy sources which are more environment friendly. Secondly, other measures such as reduction of plastic usage, waste segregation and utilization of public transport should be encouraged. Thirdly, the government should build high speed rail networks to discourage people from taking domestic flights.
In conclusion, even though there are several problems associated with growing the growing number of flights, certain measures can be taken in order to reduce the negative impact on our environment.",7.5,there-is-an-increasing-demand-for-flights-what-problems-does-this-cause-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
911,"It is thought that a school teacher’s role is to motivate and inspire students. However, other people believe that a teacher’s primary role is to pass on knowledge. What do you think is the role of a teacher?","It is an undeniable fact that teachers play a significant role in shaping a child’s future. While many believe that a teacher’s role is to educate students, others believe that they should act as a beacon of hope and inspiration. In my opinion, teachers should both educate and motivate students.
Although it is conventional to think that teachers should focus solely on academics, I believe that it shouldn’t be their only role. This is because youngsters spend much of their time in schools and tend to pick up social skills and moral values from their peers and instructors. Additionally, they tend to listen to their professors as they have utmost respect for them. Therefore, it is imperative that teachers inculcate a sense of responsibility and empathy in their students, as they have the power to change a child’s life for the better.
Moreover, most teenagers rely on their teachers for support in crisis, as most parents simply do not have enough time to spend with their kids. Many teenagers suffer depression and psychological breakdown during their adolescent years and teachers play a pivotal role during this time. Therefore, it is quite evident that teachers need to be the pillar of strength for students during these tough times.
In conclusion, although academics play a crucial role in a child’s life, it is also important that they grow up into mature and responsible adults. Teachers play a huge role in this regard and therefore, in addition to sharing knowledge, they should inspire and motivate their students to be a better version of themselves.",7.5,a-teachers-role-is-to-motivate-and-inspire-students-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
912,Some people think it is more important to spend time in developing a successful career while others think it is more important to spend time with friends and family. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, many people hold the view that career development is more important due to the fierce competition in the modern society. At the same time, there are people who opine that those who live in the fast-paced life should slow down and spend more time with family and friends. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the debate before arriving at a conclusion.
To begin with, there is no doubt that career development contributes to the improvement of people’s living standard and sense of fulfilment. It is possible to say that a person who tends to devote more time on his/her job pursues more financial return. The main reason for this is that financial security now has become extremely vital to a family—a household not only has to bear the daily expenses that are continuously rising, but also pay the exorbitant tuition fee of its children. In addition, a prestigious job brings an individual a sense of fulfilment including fame and higher social status.
However, others have the opinion that it is necessary for people to dedicate more time to their friends and family, since the fast pace of life somehow leads to the disintegration of families and relationships. For example, parents who pursue money and career are more likely to neglect their children and the elders in their family; college graduates who seek better job opportunity choose to migrate to metropolises that are far away from their home.
To summarize, there is no easy answer to this debate. On balance, however, we have to admit that both career and family play a significant role in our lives. Hence, it is important for us to balance these two aspects in order to make our life happier.",7.5,some-people-think-that-it-is-more-important-to-spend-time-in-developing-a-successful-career-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
913,"Some people think that the government is wasting money on the arts and that this money could be better spent elsewhere.
To what extent do you agree with this view?","Whether art and artists should receive government funding has always been a topic of discussion. Some people opine that instead of wasting money on arts, the government should allocate its funds for the betterment of other sectors. I cannot agree with this opinion. In my opinion art is as important as any other sector and should receive government support.
There are several reasons why the government should spend money on arts. One of the predominant reasons is that art reflects the culture of a country and promotes people’s understanding of their culture and architecture. Secondly, people from outside the country come to see the historical buildings and by maintaining its artistic legacy, a country can encourage tourists to visit again and again. This practice boosts the tourism sector and eventually the economic growth of a country. Thirdly, the art sector employs many people. For example, artists like singers and dancers have huge fan following. Their shows are watched by thousands of people. Such events provide employment to hundreds of people. Without government funding many art forms will die down and that will be a huge loss for the country.
However, spending on arts should not be at the expense of other sectors like education, healthcare or defence. Those are certainly more important and hence should receive more funding. It is just that art should not be neglected.
To conclude, I believe that the government should distribute its funds evenly to all sectors including arts because every sector has its own contribution towards the development of a country.",7.5,some-people-think-that-the-government-is-wasting-money-on-arts-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
914,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Today marketers can target potential customers through a plethora of platforms like social media applications, television, radio, newspapers and so on. The ads are designed and promoted in such a fashion that they catch the attention of the consumer and convince them to buy products that are not a necessity. I advocate the view that adverts manipulate the buying needs of a consumer which eventually increases the overall sales of any product.
The marketing companies these days, focus on designing ads in such a way that they are bound to catch the attention of an online user. Social applications like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are being used bluntly to bombard users with the advertisements of the products that are trending. The buying as well as the search patterns of a user is cached and the ads related to the products of interest are then constantly flashed on his/her screen. For example, Amazon the most successful online retail store always pops up an “others also viewed” and “products recommended” sections on the side bars. This indirect method of recommending goods instigates unintentional shopping thereby increasing the sales.
Secondly, with the help of technology, the pace of information sharing has improved drastically. The news feed travels faster than a wild fire. Celebrity endorsing of products also boost sales. One clear example is the commercial of an actor selling a slimming belt. The hypothetical idea of losing weight without exercising has proven to be a fruitful selling point despite its adverse effects on the health. Another example is the “Market Bucket Analytics”, which is used for promoting the offers on the goods in such a way that the sale of one product helps the sale of another. For instance, a jar of jam free with a bigger packet of bread.
To conclude, advertisements have an extraordinary power to influence the public. The number of sales made is directly proportional to the amount of publicity done .Therefore, organizations rely on ads to generate an opportunity and capitalize on them. The ability to promote any product in the market has totally impacted the buying patterns of the buyers and has strongly worked like a boon for various industries.",7.5,the-sale-of-popular-consumer-goods-reflect-the-power-of-advertising-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
915,Some people believe that old public buildings in cities should be restored while others say that they should be demolished and new buildings should be built instead. Discuss Both sides and give your opinion.,"People often debate whether old buildings should be restored or demolished. In my opinion, they should be restored; however, I will discuss both sides of the argument in this essay.
Old public buildings are beneficial for the society as a whole in many ways. They help the younger generation to understand and appreciate their culture and tradition in a better way. In addition to that they make them learn about the architecture of that period. In the olden days, there is was electricity or modern construction equipment. Yet, skilled masons managed to build structures that remain architectural marvels even today. It is a pity and a monumental loss to demolish them. Therefore, in my opinion, instead of demolishing these buildings, the government should restore them so that they can be used as government offices, tourist attractions or hotels and by doing this the government can earn a considerable revenue. Palaces of kings being used as municipal offices in Punjab and as hotels and tourist attractions in Udaipur are some of the examples of old being used in an effective way after restoring.
On the other hand, people advocating against restoring these buildings put forth the argument that the cost of refurbishing the building is sometimes more than the cost of demolishing and constructing new building. Moreover, due to increase in population and advancement in technology the architecture of modern world has changed completely. Now emphasis has to be put on eco friendly building which can incorporate renewable sources of energy like solar energy. To add to it, the number of offices and staff has increased so the old buildings are not able to cater to the need of different departments and therefore new buildings with modern design and infrastructure are required.
To conclude, no doubt the modern buildings with the latest design and amenities are the need of the hour, but lots of sentiments and social values are attached to historic buildings. Thus the demolition of old buildings should be considered only as the last option available.",7.5,some-people-say-that-old-buildings-should-be-restored-others-say-that-they-should-be-demolished-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
916,"There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What forms do they take? Do you agree that the problems outweigh the benefits of mobile phones?","New developments in the field of technology have revolutionized our lives tremendously. These have both positive and negative impacts. One such invention is the mobile phone. It has become an extremely important part of our lifestyle. Some people claim that owning a mobile phone causes social, technical as well as health issues. However, I believe that having a mobile phone has plenty of benefits which outweigh the disadvantages. This essay takes a look at both sides of the argument.
Firstly, the mobile phones are one of the most commonly used gadgets globally. Cell phones allow us to stay in contact with our family and friends through messages and calls. They have minimized the distance between people. Now, we are able to communicate with our family no matter where we are. We can listen to their voices as well as see them through video calls. Secondly, mobile phones provide us an opportunity to make friends globally by using certain social media websites like Facebook and Instagram. This helps us to discover different cultures. Thirdly, cell phone is a very beneficial invention for students. They can get homework help online within seconds. Also, mobile phones keep them up to date with current affairs and new inventions.
On the other hand, there are a few disadvantages to mobile phones. Excessive use of mobile phones can affect our eyesight as well as cause mental stress. Moreover, these days, we are addicted to cell phones and cannot give proper time to our families. Also our social interactions have reduced and now we only greet our friends through mobile phones.
To conclude, there are plenty of benefits to having a mobile phone. However, everyone should limit their use of the mobile phone so that their health is not affected and they can give proper time to their families.",7.5,there-are-social-medical-and-technical-problems-associated-with-the-use-of-mobile-phones-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

Do you think it is important to buy organic food despite the higher prices? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There is no doubt that consumption of organically cultivated food is good for people’s health, and this is one of most important reasons why people prefer organic food over / to conventionally grown food. I think it is important to consume organic food even though it is expensive.
One of the main reasons why people think organic food is beneficial is the role it plays in the reduction of environment pollution. This is because organic farming strictly uses plant and animal waste for fertilizers and avoids the usage of chemical fertilizers. As a result, air and water pollution will reduce considerably. Also, recent studies show that chemical fertilizers is one of the most important factors which turn fertile agricultural land into barren land on which no crops can grow. This is another important reason for preferring organic food over conventionally produced food.
Another reason why organic food is being considered is the health benefits it offers to humans. Unlike conventionally produced food, organic food is good for preventing illness. To illustrate this, recent studies have shown that a number of diseases are caused by the consumption of fruits, vegetables and grains treated with pesticides.
To conclude, organic food is becoming more popular because its cultivation and consumption benefit both the people and the society. Although it is expensive, it is healthy and eco-friendly.",7.5,organic-food-is-expensive-yet-many-people-buy-it-why-is-so-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
918,"Learning English at school is often seen as more important than learning local languages. If these are not taught, many are at risk of dying out. In your opinion, is it important to learn English? Should we try to ensure the survival of local languages and so, how?","Language is crucial for expressing ideas and emotions. Although there are numerous languages in the world in my opinion it is important for everyone to learn English because of its reach; however, I also believe that it is equally important to ensure the survival of local languages.
One’s native language represents one’s culture. It is a cultural heirloom that belongs to the entire community. I am of the opinion that literature in our local language teaches us a lot of values which are required for protecting our identity in this world of commercialization and globalization.
By contrast, English is a language widely used all over the world. It is usually taught in school along with other local languages. It serves as a bridge between people whose first language is different. Moreover English literature is rich in history, values and ethics. Being able to read and write English is no doubt an achievement in this age of globalization. Hence I reemphasize the importance of learning English.
However, preserving local languages is as important as learning English. If local languages are not taught, they will soon become extinct. Therefore, efforts have to be made to ensure their survival. A good solution is to teach both the languages at school. Parents should make it a point to converse with their children in their mother tongue. Schools should also enact plays in local languages and organize reading sessions. For instance, we were taught English and Sanskrit) in school and every afternoon for about fifteen minutes, five students each had to read a few pages of the holy book Bhagavad-Gita which is written in Sanskrit . This made sure that all students learnt the language.
To summarize, English ensures barrier free communication among people and local languages help us carry forward our culture to the future generations; therefore I cannot stop emphasizing the importance of learning and teaching both the languages.",7.5,is-learning-english-more-important-than-learning-local-languages-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-2
919,"International travel brings benefits to travellers and the countries visited, but it also causes problems for the environment. Do the disadvantages outweigh the advantages?","Recent studies have shown that the number of people travelling internationally has increased tremendously. Tourism offers many advantages to the tourists as well as to the tourist places. However, this continuous growth in overseas traveling certainly creates some problems. Even so, in my opinion, the advantages of international traveling outweigh the disadvantages.
Nowadays, more people are travelling internationally than in the past. They make plans to visit a new country or place with their families and these trips give them a chance to spend some quality time together. In this era of competition, everyone is busy with their tough work commitments. Therefore, a holiday brings families together and allows them to forget their stresses and enjoy their lives. Moreover, international travel tickets are cheap, which encourage more people to explore the world and discover new customs and cultures.
International traveling also benefits the countries that are visited. For many small countries in Asia, Africa and Europe tourism is the main source of revenue. Most of the people living in famous tourist places earn money by selling souvenir and other items which represent their countries and culture. Consequently, the higher the number of visitors, stronger the economy of the nation. Last but not least, International travelling boosts peace and understanding among countries.
On the other hand, there are a few disadvantages to international travelling. The increasing air traffic causes a great deal of environmental pollution and leads to many health issues. Also when more people visit famous historical places, they may cause some damage to the monuments or artifacts.
In conclusion, the disadvantages of international traveling certainly do not outweigh the advantages. Even so, the downsides cannot be overlooked.

920,"Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","According to a section of the society, the retirement age should be increased due to the increasing lifespan of the people. I strongly disagree with this opinion because in my opinion just because people are living longer it does not mean that they can or should work beyond a certain age. Also, during their twilight years, their priority should be spending more time with their family and taking care of their health. In this essay, I will defend my perspective with valid arguments.
One of the logical reasons for not increasing the retirement age is that people work hard throughout their regular working life and they hardly get enough time for vacations and family gatherings. Considering this, during the later stage of their life, they must be given an opportunity to relax and spend enough time with their children. For example, this concept is very common in Asian countries, where most elderly people retire early and they only manage family affairs after retirement.
Another argument in support of not increasing the retirement age is that older people require sufficient medical care. Most of the people have diseases like blood pressure and heart problems, which require significant healthcare. Therefore, it is very tough for them to face the work pressure at the workplace.  For instance, recently in our office one of the older workers died because of heart attack and his medical examination revealed that the cause of his death was excessive work pressure.
In conclusion, I reiterate that retirement age should not be increased. This is because people should give maximum time to their families in the later part of their life. Also, at this age caring for their health is more important than working.",7.5,people-are-living-longer-so-the-retirement-age-should-be-raised-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
921,"Some people think that parents should teach children how to be good members of the society. Others, however, believe that the school is the best place to learn this. Discuss both views and give own opinion.","Man is a social being and no one can exist as an island. While some people hold the view that parents have the responsibility to teach their children to become a good member of the society, others feel that the school is the best place to learn social values. In my opinion, both the parents and the teachers have an indispensable role in shaping the character of their children.
Firstly, parents are the primary teachers and home is the first school where the personality development of children is initiated. From birth to preschool children are under the sole custody of their parents. They imitate the actions of their parents and for this reason it is important for parents to become a good role model for their children. Parents are the best people to teach them the concept of good and bad. When they are taught to make this distinction from a young age, they are unlikely to go astray when they grow up.
However, parents are not the only influence on children. Teachers at school have an equally important role to play in the formation of their character. The school is essentially a microcosm of the universe. Here the children get to interact with other children of different character, personality and family backgrounds. This exposure that they get at school plays a crucial role in the formation of their parents. It is the duty of parents to instil in them the values of discipline and social commitment.
To conclude, parents and teachers both have an equally important role in moulding the character of children. In my opinion, their roles are complementary.",7.5,some-people-think-that-parents-should-teach-children-to-be-good-members-of-the-society-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
922,Some people say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do you agree that the internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?,"It is argued that the internet has facilitated better connectivity and improved communication among users resulting in a more connected and accessible world. As far as I am concerned, this I true. In this essay I will support the above argument and mention the impact of the internet on communication and connectivity among people.
The internet has made it easy to connect to a person in any part of the world anytime. Earlier it was a tedious and time consuming process. In the present era, there are a number of ways such as the email, web-chat and VOIP calls to stay in touch with our near and dear ones or colleagues. Modern internet based computer and mobile applications have made it easier to establish a connection or send a message at any time we want. Ease of accessing technology has also increased the number of internet users dramatically. For instance, earlier people used to make international calls by using traditional landlines but now recent surveys show that over 85% of cross-border calls are made using the internet.
Another aspect behind the success of the internet is its exponentially falling service charges. Earlier the cost of Telegram or ISD calls was too high for ordinary people to afford. By contrast, advancement in telecommunication equipment and increased competition among internet service providers have pushed the internet service cost considerably down. This has been proven a boon for internet users. The internet is now almost free in comparison to its service charges used to be in early 20s. For example, in 1995 the connection charge for a one minute call between New Delhi and London was approximately 100 rupees while it has become free now through internet calling.
To conclude, the internet is a huge success because of the plethora of benefits offered by it. It allowed people to connect in a very easy and economical way and changed this planet into a highly connected small village.",7.5,the-internet-has-made-the-world-smaller-by-bringing-people-together-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
923,Nowadays people are affected by social media and internet. Is it a good or bad trend in your opinion? Explain it by giving your own examples.,"In the contemporary era, people are heavily influenced by the internet and social networking sites. Though this influence may be positive in terms of the virtual connectivity and better access to information, in my opinion, the internet and social media have a bigger negative impact. They make people inert and render age old traditions redundant.
Of course, technological innovations have benefitted people in many ways. People today can connect with those living at far off places and interact with them with unprecedented convenience. In older days, it was almost impossible to talk with one’s kith and kin living in foreign countries in the event of an emergency. Furthermore, the internet and social networking sites facilitate dissemination of any news or information rapidly. Any event which is happening in one part of the world can be seen / watched by people at the same time throughout the globe. For instance, social networking sites such as YouTube present live coverage of any significant event throughout the world. Even so, in my opinion, the internet and social media make people lonely and unhealthy and render customs and traditions obsolete.
I believe that Internet and social media encourage people to live in the virtual world and miss out on real personal interactions. This technology forces people to remain addicted to this form of social interaction. As a result, people avoid visiting parks, clubs and prefer solitude. This passive lifestyle gives rise to diseases such as hypertension, obesity etc. Furthermore, our age old traditions of greeting our family members and peers by visiting them physically have become obsolete. To illustrate, nowadays people send greetings on the birthdays of their family members and friends through Facebook.
In conclusion, although the internet and the social media improve virtual connectivity and communication, I believe that this technology has negatively impacted the health of the people and our age old traditions.",7.5,nowadays-people-are-affected-by-the-internet-and-social-media-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
924,Many museums and historical sites are mainly visited by tourists but not local people. Why is this the case? What can be done to attract local people to visit these places?,"This is another essay on this topic.
Museums and historical places are considered as the knowledge centers of a city. They depict the history, the culture and the tradition of that area. It can be seen that the local people do not prefer to go to these sites; only the tourists visit them. This essay will discuss why locals do not visit museums and historical buildings and also suggest some ways to attract them.
To begin with, there are several reasons why local members do not visit the local places of history and museums. First and foremost individuals are busy with their domestic chores and they are happy with their sedentary lifestyles. For example, it should be noted that Delhi boasts of a number of museums and historical monuments; the local people do not visit them because the majority of the population in Delhi is working. They have long working hours and after coming back from work they are left with very less energy. Tourists, on the other hand, are in a city to explore all places of interest, so they will definitely visit museums.
There are myriad ways to attract native people to museums and historical sites. For example, schools can give their students assignments related to the history, culture and tradition of their native place. This will encourage most parents to take their children to museums to collect useful information. In addition, local administration can conduct various exhibitions at these places to attract local people. For example, the exhibitions on local handmade products can attract locals.
To conclude, local people do not visit local museums and historical sites due to the fact that they are busy with their life. We can use various ways to get them interested. For example, conducting exhibitions and giving arts and history based assignments in schools will help.",7.5,local-people-do-not-visit-museums-and-historical-places-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
925,"Shopping is become more and more popular as leisure activity. However, some people feel that this has both positive and negative effects? Why is shopping so popular? What effects does its popularity have on individuals and on society?","The trend of shopping as a leisure activity has emerged in recent times. Nowadays, people spend their free time either in shopping malls or on e-commerce websites. This essay will discuss various causes and effects of this development on individuals and the society.
To embark on, there are several reasons why shopping has become a popular activity. First and foremost, the majority of companies give different kinds of offers and discounts on their products in order to attract customers. For example, it should be noted that big corporate houses tie-up with credit card vendors and banks. They provide many cash back offers on different products and sometimes they offer zero interest EMI schemes to lure consumers. As a result, people get mini loans without interest rates and this encourages them to buy products even if they do not need them. In addition to this, it can be seen that many e-commerce websites use data analytics techniques to know about the preferences of people and then they show advertisements of various offers on that particular product to attract customers. For instance, Amazon, an online shopping website, records the pattern of customer shopping habits and then uses this information to lure them into buying more.
People are becoming shopaholic. This development has affected the society positively and negatively. It should be noted that this trend has increased the number of sales and profits of companies which in turn lead them to open new factories and warehouses to meet the increasing demands. As a result, people get more job opportunities.
On the flip side, due to over shopping people are facing unnecessary burdens of debt. They spend a big chuck of their earnings to pay off personal loans and EMIs. Consequently, they have no money to save.
To conclude, I personally feel that people are addicted to shopping and they buy even products they do not want and put undue pressure on themselves. Corporate houses are grabbing the hard earned money of individuals by using smart marketing strategies and becoming richer.",7.5,shopping-has-become-more-and-more-popular-as-a-leisure-activity
926,"Learning English at school is often seen as more important than learning local languages. If these are not taught, many are at risk of dying out. In your opinion, is it important for everyone to learn English? Should we try to ensure the survival of local languages and, ifso, how?","Language is a way to communicate your ideas, thoughts and opinions with other people. English is one of the languages that is often considered essential to learn in today’s world. There is a considerable decline in the interest to learn the local languages. In fact, some of them are on the verge of dying out. In my opinion, it is important for everyone to learn English. At the same time, it is equally important to preserve local languages.
Firstly, English is the official language in more than 50 countries most of which are well-developed nations where one might be interested in settling down in the future. English speaking skills will come in handy in situations when you are trying to migrate abroad. The English speaking countries such as the US, the UK and Canada are considered to be the best destinations for higher education. One must, therefore, have a strong command of the language in order to successfully thrive in an English speaking country. In addition, the job opportunities for an individual with better English skills are numerous. The employers are only interested in those candidates who can have a good conversation with their clients and express their opinions fluently. This skill is extremely important in this age of globalisation as the clients of the employers are often from different parts of the world. A good knowledge of English is also required to make the best use of information available on the internet because most of the websites are in English.
However, I feel the local languages should also be taught so as to preserve them for future generations. There are many scriptures and books written in local languages that are full of knowledge and wisdom. For example, the books on Ayurveda, a traditional healing practice, are written in Sanskrit. As many people are leaning towards natural healing therapy, it has become all the more important to learn and preserve the minority languages that allow us to decipher such ancient texts. Including these languages in the school curriculum is one of the ways to preserve them. Parents should make an effort to teach their children by regularly conversing with them in their mother tongue. Also, the Government should provide incentives such as scholarship to students with local language skills.
To conclude, I believe that English is necessary to succeed in all walks of life as it makes one more confident. Nevertheless, the local language also needs to be given their due respect. I feel an equal effort should be made by individuals to learn both these languages.",7.5,is-learning-english-more-important-than-learning-local-languages-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","According to some people technological innovations have made people more sociable; however, others disagree with that view. In my opinion modern technology is making people more sociable but at the same time it hinders the face to face interaction among people. I will explain my view in this essay.
On the one hand, it is an irrefutable fact that modern technology has shrunk our big planet earth into a small global village. Now it is possible for a person to contact his kith and kin who are sitting on the other side of the planet with the use of the internet and mobile phones or laptops on a regular basis. This frequent contact among family members and friends strengthens the bond. Moreover, with the advent of fast transport systems / services like metro trains, bullet trains and flights the distance and travel time has minimised and it is now possible for people to visit their relatives living in other countries or states more frequently. Obviously, technology has increased the interactions among people.
On the other hand, sometimes, children and adults become so obsessed with technology that they avoid in-person interaction with their relatives and friends. Children become so engrossed with new gadgets that they avoid spending time with their parents and friends. What is more, with the advent of e-commerce and various other websites now people are able to buy commodities of daily need or pay their bills online and this again has limited the actual interaction among people.
To conclude, I reiterate that modern technology has given people a platform to stay in touch with their loved ones but at the same time it has taken out face to face interactions from the equation.",7.5,some-people-think-that-modern-technology-is-making-people-more-sociable-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
928,It is generally accepted that exercise is good for children and teenagers. Therefore physical education and sport should be compulsory for all students in all schools. What do you think? Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The benefits exercise has on children and teenagers are numerous. Incidences of lifestyle diseases such as obesity and diabetes are rising at an alarming rate, due to lack of regular exercise and wrong eating habits. In my opinion, one of the key ways to improve health and overall fitness is to make physical education and sport mandatory in schools.
Health benefits are the number one reason to make sports mandatory. Children who do not exercise are often found to be obese. Obesity brings with it a host of other diseases. Most of the obese children lack self esteem and are insecure about their fitness and looks. This may be one of the causes of depression among young people. By making physical education and sports compulsory in schools, the government can encourage students to engage in physical activity which will benefit them in the long run.
By participating in sports, teenagers not only get the much needed exercise but also learn skills for life. For example, most of the sports require the team members to co-ordinate and encourage fellow mates to achieve the common goal of winning the game). Interacting with team members and conveying their opinions and ideas will allow them to think and express freely. These skills will eventually make the person an extrovert and help in developing leadership qualities.
Making sport mandatory will in particular benefit those students who have a natural talent for it. By including sport in the curriculum, the government can encourage talented students to build a career out of it. Since children get to try their hands on various kinds of sports at school, they can choose the one they feel good at. There are many instances, where children from financially unstable families found their calling in sports while at school. Some of them have excelled in it and become extremely successful.
In conclusion, I feel that the schools should make sports and physical education mandatory in order to keep their students physically and mentally fit and to create awareness about the necessity of exercise in one’s lives.",7.5,sports-should-be-compulsory-for-all-students-in-all-schools-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
929,Scientists agree that many people are eating too much junk food and it is damaging their health. Some people think that these problems can be solved by educating people to eat less junk food. Other people believe that education will not work. Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.,"Health experts and researchers have proven that the excessive consumption of junk food can be troublesome for one’s health. It has now given rise to many health related concerns. A lot of fitness experts, dieticians, and nutritionists are trying to teach the people about the consequences and associated risks of junk food. In my opinion, these awareness campaigns certainly help but they are not enough.
Generally speaking, people have no idea of their daily intake of carbohydrates or fats. Both are present in higher quantity in all types of junk food. Hence excessive consumption of fast food may create many health problems in the future. The recent statistics show that there has been an increase in the incidences / cases of heart problems, diabetic issues and obesity problems amongst even young people. To counter this, the government has already launched many health education campaigns. In my opinion, these campaigns certainly help people to distinguish healthy food from unhealthy food.
However, by simply imparting education about the importance of eating right, the government cannot reduce the consumption of junk food. To start with, many people who consume these convenience foods are highly educated. They know fast food harms their health; yet they consume it because they find it easy and convenient. For example, busy executives do not have time to cook proper meals. It is easier for them to grab a packet of instant noodles than to prepare dosa or chapathi at home. Health awareness programmes may not have the right effect on them. A better solution is to make healthy food more affordable and more easily available.
To conclude, launching educational and awareness campaigns about the harmful effects of junk food is certainly beneficial; however, that alone is unlikely to reduce the consumption of junk food because lack of awareness is rarely the reason that encourages people to eat junk.

Why is shopping so popular? What effects does its increase in popularity have on individuals and on society?","Thanks to growing consumerism, there is a massive rise in the number of people who shop for fun and pleasure. This trend is galloping because of the intensive marketing techniques employed by companies and online shopping platforms such as ecommerce websites and applications. In my opinion, this is largely a positive development.
To embark on, there are some reasons why shopping activities have increased dramatically in recent times. First and foremost, business houses are using data science techniques to analyze the human psychology and their likes and dislikes. For example, Levis outlets request their customers to complete a questionnaire about their experience and suggestions. Such strategies make the customers feel that the company values their opinion and feedback. Additionally, companies hire celebrities to endorse their products. Shopping has also become easier these days thanks to the internet. People can now shop online using their computer or smart phone. There are umpteen web applications available which offer free home delivery and easy exchange and easy return facility. All of these factors encourage people to buy more and more.
This sharp increase in shopping trend has benefitted both the individual and the society in many ways. First, shopping can be a therapeutic experience. It is a great stress buster for many busy people. Secondly, the increased shopping activity will boost the economy and companies will produce better products at low prices to meet the needs of consumers. This will definitely create employment opportunities.
To conclude, shopping activity has increased because companies are using modern technologies and platforms to sell their products. This trend has affected the society and individuals positively in terms of self-satisfaction and better product selection for individuals and economical development for the society.

In my opinion, it is justified because it helps scientists to invent several medicines and antibiotics which save humans from deadly diseases. This essay will discuss why it is necessary to conduct experiments on animals.
No doubt, conducting experiments on animals is inhumane and cruel. Human beings do not have the right to harm animals because they also own this planet. However, these experiments are very beneficial for the human race and the life of a human being is more important than that of an animal.
It is a well-known fact that various experiments on mice and rabbits help scientists and doctors to invent drugs and antidotes for many life threatening diseases. For instance, it should be noted that the cure for hepatitis C was invented by doing experiments on rats. As a result, it saved millions of patients who were suffering from this deadly disease. In addition to this, the first heart transplant was performed on a dog and it became very successful. This success gave doctors a lot of confidence to perform the same procedure on human beings. On the other hand, there are several stories of inhuman acts associated with these experiments.  For example, scientists in the USA deliberately burned the skins of thousands of pigs to discover new procedures of plastic surgeries. These kinds of acts are inhumane and must be prohibited.
There are also some alternative ways of inventing drugs without conducting experiments on animals. First and foremost, now we can make various human organs from stem cells grown in laboratories. Scientists can use these cells and organs for experiments. Apart from that, many computer modelling techniques can also give results of a particular procedure without performing the actual experiment.
To conclude, although we do not have the right to perform such experiments on animals we do not have many other viable options. For the time being it is justified due to the fact that the human life is more important than the animal life.",7.5,do-you-believe-that-experimentation-on-animals-for-scientific-purposes-is-justified-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
932,"Some people think that new technology is improving the lives of workers, other say it has more disadvantages. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the modern society, technology has become a vital part of every human’s life. While some believe that technology advances the lives of individuals who use it, others counter this statement. In my point of view, technology plays an instrumental role in enhancing the productivity of the people and making the work space more comfortable.
There are many benefits to using technology and it has improved our life in various ways. Firstly, technology saves a lot of time for any individual who uses it in day to day life. For example, instead of cleaning dishes manually, people can use a dishwasher which automatically cleans and dries utensils. Consequently, people can use that time for more productive activities.
Secondly, many tasks can be completed effortlessly by using advanced devices. For example, machines can be used instead of manual labour for building residential and commercial complexes. Technology has also made people’s lives safer. For example, by installing surveillance cameras, we can protect our homes and offices from intruders.
On the other hand, technology can cause some problems in the society. It has been observed that human beings have become lethargic due to the use of technological automation and lack of manual hard work. Furthermore, technology has made people dependent on it. For example, many people become stressed out when they do not have access to their cell phone or the internet.
To sum up, technology certainly has many positive impacts on people’s lives, but it has some negative impacts too. It is the responsibility of people to use technology to their advantage.",7.5,technology-is-improving-the-lives-of-workers-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
933,Some believe that people should not continue work once they reach age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answers and include relevant examples from you experience.,"Some people opine that employees should discontinue working once they attain age of superannuation. I do not agree with this notion, as in my opinion, retired people can contribute immensely for the betterment of the society and by continuing to work they can keep themselves fit. This essay will discuss why I believe that seniors should be allowed to work as long as they want.
In my perspective, people should continue working beyond the retirement age since they can utilize their expertise for the betterment of the society. They can provide selfless service to the society which will benefit both the public and the government. Moreover, retirees can form a workforce which can deal with the problems in the society which are not solved by the authorities. To illustrate, retired doctors can provide their services free of cost in rural areas where medical facilities are appalling. Therefore, it is beneficial to the society, if people do not stop working at the age of retirement.
Moreover, I believe, continuing work even after retirement, is the key to keep your body and mind healthy. People who sit idle after superannuation, become lethargic and have a stale mind. However, people with aims in life, even if they have retired, remain energetic, disciplined and health conscious. As a result they do not suffer from diseases and remain fit in old age. To illustrate this view, I would refer to a study conducted by Geriatric society of India about reasons for remaining fit in old age. The study showed that people who follow a healthy lifestyle and keep themselves busy in some work remain fit.
In conclusion, I firmly endorse working after retirement to make selfless contributions for the betterment of the society and to remain healthy during old age.",7.5,people-should-not-continue-work-after-they-reach-age-of-retirement-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
934,Different cultures are mixing today and the world is becoming a global village. Is it a positive or a negative development? Give your own opinion and examples.,"It is true that, nowadays, people with different cultural background are interacting with one another and turning the world into a small village. In my opinion, amalgamation of different cultures is a positive trend due to economic advantages and propagation of religious harmony.
In my perspective, economic development is achieved when people from all over the world communicate. Such communication facilitates trade between different communities. Products specific / unique to a particular community or area can be exported to places where they are not available. Thus, it helps in boosting the economy of the world holistically. To illustrate, silk which is extensively produced in India is exported to European countries. This is possible only due to cultural associations between them.
Additionally, I believe that the religious harmony is promoted as a result of the cultural exchanges between different countries. People understand and respect each other’s cultures when they get the opportunity to explore them. These interactions make them more tolerant of differences. Furthermore, incidences of racial hatred and crimes have decreased in recent years. This can be firmly attributed to the rise in cultural interaction between different communities. From my personal experience, I can vouch for this change. To illustrate, cricket players from different cultures now rarely hurtle racial abuses at one another because they have started playing for the same team in cricket leagues such as IPL.
In conclusion, I believe mutual interaction between people of different cultures is a positive development because it benefits the economy and promotes communal harmony.",7.5,different-cultures-are-mixing-today-and-the-world-is-becoming-a-global-village-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
935,"The three pie charts below show the changes in annual spending by local authorities in Someland in 1980, 1990 and 2000. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.","The given pie charts show information regarding the proportion of annual budget spent on different sectors by the local authorities in Someland in the years 1980, 1990 and 2000. Overall, it can be seen that a major chunk of the budget was used for higher education during the given period. While in 1980, Someland spent 35% of its annual budget on higher education, the spending on this area in 1990 and 2000 was 45% and 40% respectively. The next biggest expenditure was K-12 education and it was at around 25%, 20% and 18% in 1980, 1990 and 2000 respectively. Interestingly, the expenditure on this area decreased over the years.
As for transportation, the proportion of money spent was as low as 6% in 1990, whereas in 2000 it was slightly more than one third of the total expenditure. The annual expenditure in health and human resources in 1990 (20%) was twice that in 2000 (10%). The expenditure on environmental services and others never rose about 10% during the three years. Actually, the expenditure on environmental services was 4% and 5% in 1980 and 1990 but it rose to 9% in 2000.",7.5,expenditure-in-someland-band-7-5-ielts-report-sample
936,Space exploration costs tax payers’ an exorbitant amount of money each year. What are the advantages and disadvantages of spending money on space exploration?,"Over the past few years, space exploration has been the most interesting topic all over the world. Research and experiments in this field involve high expenditure and money for this purpose comes from taxpayers. While it is true that spending money on space exploration offers a few advantages, there are some disadvantages as well and they cannot be overlooked.
The main advantage of space exploration is the possibility of finding another habitable place in the universe for humans to live. The reason for this is that the Earth has limited natural resources; thus, it is important to find an alternative place to live in before all its resources are exhausted. In addition to that, we need satellites in space to collect information about climatic changes and to spot extraterrestrial objects that approach earth. Satellites also help the functioning of broadcasting stations and navigational systems on earth. However, a lot of money is required to maintain these satellites.
The major disadvantage of space research is that a large amount of money is required for building a spacecraft. There had been many instances where the launch of the spacecraft had failed; thus all those money involved was wasted. The truth is that we do not have send missions to Mars or Jupiter to live peacefully on our planet. Actually if the millions or billions of dollars used for space research were used to improve the conditions on earth, we would not have to look for habitable planets elsewhere.
To conclude, space research certainly benefits humanity; however, there is no justification for spending huge amounts on it because improving the conditions on earth is much better than trying to colonise other planets.",7.5,advantages-and-disadvantages-of-space-exploration-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
937,Success is often measured by wealth and material belongings. Do you think wealth is the best measure of success? What makes a successful person?,"Some people think that money and materialistic possessions are the best measures of success. In this essay, I will discuss the role of wealth in measuring the success of a person.
A large number of people consider the financial status of a person to determine whether he is successful. I do not agree with this approach. In my opinion, wealth could be an indicator of a person’s success but it is not the only factor to consider. For example, we can look at the success stories of people like Mahatma Gandhi who didn’t possess any wealth or assets and yet was very successful as a leader and led a very meaningful life. On the other hand, we have people like Warren Buffett who donated all his wealth to charity; he is very successful in motivating a large section of people with his philanthropic ways.
A person’s success or failure in not measured by his earnings or his materialistic possessions. There is something else beyond all the money that he possesses. For example, some of the most influential people in the world were not rich; yet they changed the course of history with their life. They are the perfect epitome of success without wealth and materialistic possessions. So, in my opinion, a successful person is one who is capable of motivating others and making a difference to their lives.
Finally to conclude, we have legends like Gandhi and Warren Buffett to prove that wealth is not the only measure of success. In my opinion, the biggest measure of a person’s success is his ability to make a positive difference to the lives of others.",7.5,do-you-think-wealth-is-the-best-measure-of-success-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
938,Nowadays many people have access to computers on a wide basis and a large number of children play computer games. What are the negative impacts of playing computer games and what can be done to minimize the bad effects?,"Computers have widely penetrated into the personal lives of humans that everyone is exposed to them on a much wider scale. Children in particular have become addicted to gaming on computers. In this essay, I will discuss the negative impacts of computer games on children.
Over the past decade computers have become widely available in the market that even children below 10 years of age have access to them. This would have been a good thing if the negative effects of computers had not overshadowed the positives. It is a well-known fact that staring at computers or playing games on them for a longer duration not only affects one’s vision but also has negative implications on one’s ability to socialize with others. For example, many youngsters these days have hardly any interactions with their family members or neighbours because they are always busy playing computer games. Unfortunately, this affects their relationships and social skills.
On the bright side, there are several ways to reduce / nullify the bad effects of playing computer games. Mostly, it is the responsibility of the parents to see that their kids get enough parental attention and opportunities to socialize with other kids. Parents must ensure that their children do not spend too much time on computers or gaming consoles. Access to these should be given only for a limited period of time in a day. Parents need to learn from the saying that, “younger generation don’t hear us, they imitate us”.
To conclude / in conclusion, there are numerous demerits to spending too much time playing computer games. Parents should supervise children to ensure that their screen time is limited.",7.5,what-are-the-negative-impacts-of-playing-computer-games-on-children-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
939,News plays an important part of most people’s lives. Why is news so important to people? Why is so much news dedicated to bad news? Should the news focus on good news instead?,"News has always played an important role in people’s lives and it is not surprising.  News enables people to stay updated about the happenings in and around their world. However, much of the news deals with bad news. In my opinion, it is important to highlight bad news, but good news should be given equal importance.
News helps the human society to learn about the happenings in and around the world. I feel that news is the best way to learn about the current affairs across the globe. It plays a major role in shaping up the perspectives of a person which in turn determines what he does for the society. But off late, most of the news reporting channels dedicate a large amount of time to report bad news instead of the good news. For example, very recently an athlete won a gold medal in the Common Wealth Games; however, the media chose to neglect this news. Instead, it gave more coverage to a political scandal which was of much less importance. This is probably because bad news shocks people and grab their attention more easily. The competition among media houses is pretty high and each one is trying to grab more eyeballs. Consequently, they are after news that will create shock and awe.
However, I am of the opinion that both good news and bad news should be addressed by media houses with equal importance. Good news always motivates people to do some good deeds for the society. Take the instance of an awareness campaign run by an NGO last weekend. It motivated a lot of youngsters to openly support the cause. Bad news should also get equal coverage because it is important for people to know about the crimes and other negative things happening around them. Only then can they protect themselves from the various dangers they face.
To conclude, both good news and bad news should be given the same kind of importance as both play a major role in shaping a person’s perspective and helps them stay safe and informed.",7.5,role-of-news-in-peoples-lives
940,The best way that a government can reduce the traffic congestion in cities is to provide public transport free of cost to people 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the increase in population, the incidences of traffic jam are also rising. Some people argue that the government should provide free public transport to reduce traffic congestion. In my opinion, this measure can solve the problem only to a certain extent.
Due to urbanization most people now prefer to reside in cities or towns instead of rural areas. This is one of the main reasons for the high density of traffic on roads. At the same time, due to the advancement in technology, cars have become more affordable and fuel efficient. This has also increased the number of vehicles on the roads.
The government is certainly trying to decrease road traffic by making public transportation smooth and speedy. For example, in a highly populated city like Ahmedabad BRTS system has been introduced which facilitates bus stations around the whole city. This bus service can be availed 24*7 by public but it is not free and hence many people prefer to use their own vehicle). Even if public transportation is free, many people will still prefer to use their own vehicles probably because buses and trains congested and less comfortable. What’s more, free public transport will be a burden on the exchequer.
In my view, there are several other measures that the government can implement to reduce road traffic. For example, it should build wider roads, construct more flyovers and separate lanes for pedestrians and bicycle riders. At the same time, it should enforce strict traffic laws and encourage people to use eco-friendly modes of transport.
To conclude, making public transport free of cost will definitely encourage more people to use it; however, those who prefer comfort and convenience over cost will still continue to use private vehicles and hence it is not an effective way to reduce traffic congestion.",7.5,providing-free-public-transport-is-the-best-way-to-reduce-traffic-congestion-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
941,People no longer use newspapers and television because the internet plays the same role. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays / in the modern world the internet is widely used across the globe. With the help of the internet, people can not only read online versions of the newspapers but also watch TV programmes. Therefore, some people argue that the internet has replaced newspapers and television. In my opinion, newspapers have certainly been replaced by the internet especially in urban areas; however, I doubt that the internet has or ever will replace the television.
Most people who read newspapers are in the 35-80 age group. Compared to the tiny letters on the newspapers, the size of the font can be increased on a smartphone or a laptop. Small fonts in newspapers are an issue for many elderly readers. They find it easy to read news on a smart phone because of its ability to adjust the font size. What’s more, online versions of newspapers are updated almost every hour.
However, I cannot agree with the argument that the internet can play the role of TV. For one thing, the internet uses a lot of data while streaming videos. Consequently, streaming a video over the internet is both costly and time consuming. Surveys have shown that there are more cable TV connections than internet connections in rural areas. In addition, the majority of users in the developing world use low end mobile phones that do not support net connectivity. What’s more, watching movies on the large screen of the television is way better than watching it on the small screen of a smart phone or laptop.
To conclude, even though the internet plays a vital role in today’s world, it cannot serve the purpose of the television. However, in my opinion, newspapers are certainly getting replaced by the internet. Working people never carry a newspaper around as much as they carry the handheld devices.",7.5,people-no-longer-use-the-television-and-the-newspapers-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
942,"Some people think that children should go to kindergarten before attending primary school, while other believe that it is better for children to stay all day with their families. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is a matter of debate whether toddlers should go to pre-primary schools or spend the whole day with parents. In my opinion, small children must attend kindergarten so that they are groomed well to attend primary school efficiently. This essay shall delve into both the views and present my opinion.
Of course, young children need the love and attention of their parents. They are happiest and safest when their parents are around. Also toddlers are too young to start formal schooling. At this age, they should be allowed to have as much fun as they want. Even so, in my opinion, keeping kids at home all the time is not a wise idea because it may affect their social and communication skills. This was not really an issue when people lived in large joint families where they could meet and talk to ten or twenty people on a regular basis. However, in the modern world of nuclear families, a pre-primary school is the only place where kids can safely interact with others.
Sending children to pre primary school has a plethora of merits. Firstly, spending a couple of hours in this setting will instill confidence in toddlers. They will not feel out of place when they go to the primary school where they stay for the longer duration. Secondly, acquisition of the basic skills mentioned above is faster in children who attend these schools. To illustrate, a recent survey by Child Psychology Association of India, fortifies the above notion that children going to kindergartens acquire language and communications skills faster than their peers who stay at home all the time. Lastly, a well groomed child in pre primary school adjusts better to the requirements of primary school.
In conclusion, keeping young children at home all the time is understandable from the point of view of security. However / Even so, sending kids to pre-primary school is highly recommended because the skills they learn from this place will benefit them immensely when they go to primary school.",7.5,children-should-go-to-kindergarten-before-primary-school-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
943,Schools are spending more time teaching traditional subjects such as history. Some people think they should rather spend more time in teaching skills that can help students find a job. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, there has been a dramatic change in the school education system. Some people believe that the time invested in teaching traditional subjects such as history is not much beneficial. In their opinion, more efforts should be made to teach skills which would be helpful to get a job. I completely agree with this opinion and in this essay I will state the reasons for my view.
The most compelling reason to reduce the focus on traditional subjects like history or literature is that the knowledge of such subjects is not tested during the interview. By contrast, knowledge of subjects such as science, technology or economics will benefit a person when they enter the job market. For instance, my friend easily got a job in a pharmaceutical company because he had a degree in science. Another reason to support my stand is that these days, communication skills and leadership qualities are very important. Hence more importance should be given to teaching these skills in schools and colleges. As a result, a person becomes more confident and it is easier to find a job.
Language skills are equally important. People who speak two or more languages have improved chances of finding a job in this age of globalization. Hence schools should give importance to language learning.
To conclude, I completely agree with the opinion that job oriented skills should be given more importance in the curriculum. This approach will enhance the career prospects of students. The purpose of education, after all, is to produce youngsters who are capable of earning a living.",7.5,schools-should-spend-more-time-teaching-skills-that-can-help-students-get-a-job-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
944,"Some people think that public art should be funded by governments, while others believe that it should be funded by other sources. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","There is no doubt that public art needs funding. People have different views about who should support it. While the support of the government is important, I agree with those who believe that other sources of funding should be considered.
Some people insist that governments have the duty to financially support public art. Governments collect taxes from the public and funding public art is a good way for them to pay back.  Public art can improve the living environment and its aesthetics. Governments can give citizens instant access to works of art by placing sculptures and paintings in public squares. Moreover, unlike private companies, governments are more likely to invest in the public art which needs regular repairs and maintenance, because it is a long-term investment without obvious financial returns. Therefore, funds from governments are necessary.
Even so, in my opinion, governments have other areas to focus on. For example, providing education and healthcare is more important than supporting arts and artists. Therefore, instead of spending millions for promoting arts, the government should encourage its citizens and other organizations to promote arts. For example, when companies promote public art, they also get to advertise their brand and enhance its value. People can also use public art to support the causes they believe in. Governments can encourage public funding of arts by giving them some tax rebates.
To conclude, public art certainly needs funding because it has a positive influence in many aspects of life. In my opinion, since governments already have heavy financial burdens on their shoulders, there is no justification for them to spend huge amounts of money to promote arts. Instead, they should encourage private organizations and individuals to invest in public arts.",7.5,some-people-think-that-public-art-should-be-funded-by-governments-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
945,"In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem?","There is no doubt that food prices are gradually increasing. While there have been many technological advances in the agricultural sector and an increase in yield, many people across the globe still starve to death. This essay will explore the causes of this disturbing trend and propose a feasible solution.
Firstly, production cost involved in agriculture is the main reason for high food prices. This is due to the lack of financial support from the government and also high price of the machineries. Moreover, the tools and machines used for sowing and harvesting are expensive for the farmers and they indirectly raise food prices. As a result, low-income consumers cannot afford food and they suffer with hunger pains.
However, the government should assist the farmers financially to control the prices. For example, the government could offer low interest loans to the farming community and also subsidise farming utilities. This will aid farmers to supply quality food in bulk to the market. When the government fails to control the farming expenses, the poor section of society cannot afford the food. Thus fluctuations in food prices can be controlled to a large extent with governmental interventions and food security can be ensured for all sections of the society.
To conclude, millions of people still go hungry because they cannot afford to buy food at the current prices. It is the responsibility of the government to implement the solution mentioned above to ensure that all sections of the society have enough to eat. As long as food remains expensive, no advancement in the field of agriculture will eradicate hunger.",7.5,despite-advances-in-agricultural-sector-many-people-still-go-hungry-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
946,Many people choose to study at university in another country. What kind of problems do you think they would encounter and what are the positive aspects of a decision like this?,"More and more youngsters today are opting to pursue higher education in a foreign country. In the last decade or so, there has been an exponential growth in the number of students wanting to graduate abroad.  The reasons for the sudden surge can be attributed to many factors.
The digital media has played a vital role in giving everyone access to information regarding the universities which are located in a different country. The majority of the students select developed nations like the US, the UK and Canada for their higher studies, as these countries offer a world class platform for research and development. What’s more, a person who has a foreign degree has better career prospects.
The decision to move to a different country has its own advantages. It makes you more independent and you are able to make the right choices, as you have a broader view of life. It forces you to come out of your comfort zone and fend for yourself. It makes you smarter and more tolerant. It is a great way to interact with people from different cultures and network. A foreign degree is often considered invaluable by employers, thus giving you an edge over others.
As for the downsides, moving to different country which is a world apart from your country could be very challenging initially. Understanding the customs and cultures of the foreign land may be quite challenging for an international student. They may not be familiar with the local etiquettes, and this may land them in embarrassing situations. Often, the cost of living abroad is enormous which leads to financial strain on the family. This may lead to anxiety and the pressure to find a job as soon as one graduates. Sometimes, the absence of loved ones can make some of them homesick and lonely. In turn, this may cause stress and lead to depression.
To conclude, there are definitely some downsides to going abroad for higher education. Even so, in my opinion, the advantages of a foreign degree outweigh the disadvantages of having to leave one’s country and people.",7.5,many-people-want-to-study-abroad-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
947,Some of the methods used in advertising are unethical and unacceptable in today’s society. To what extent do you agree with this view?,"Advertising methods nowadays make use of immoral and inappropriate content. Although commercials play an important role in product marketing, I completely agree with the argument that some of the advertisements use inappropriate ways of promotion.
To begin with, some of the adverts spread / show false information about the product resulting in customer dissatisfaction. Some commercials such as fairness and skin creams try to lure the customers by making false claims but when they use these products, they do not get satisfactory results. In addition to this, some of the ads use stunts and other pernicious activities to influence people. Although these kinds of commercials target customers of all ages, their influence / impact on youngsters is the highest. Consequently, the children want to purchase these products and try to imitate the stunts shown in the commercial at home. For example, by showing dangerous car and bike stunts in the Thumps Up commercial, this company is casting the negative impression on the minds of youngsters that by consuming this drink, anyone would be capable of performing dangerous stunts.
Furthermore, some of the advertisements contain vulgar and obscene content that can badly influence the young minds and force them to go astray. In addition to this, by using child actors in fast food, cold-drinks and chocolate commercials, these companies try to attract the children. As a result, youngsters nowadays consume more fast food, cold-drinks and chocolates instead of home cooked meal. Moreover, due to the all pervasive commercials, there is an increase in the financial burden on parent’s shoulders because they have to put up with the demands of their children. To exemplify this, by getting influenced by the Sony Play station advert, my cousin forced my uncle to purchase it for him. After a lot of arguments, my uncle gave in and he had to buy that play station to his son.
In conclusion, I reiterate that some companies use inappropriate and unethical ways to advertise their products and this practice results in consumer dissatisfaction and detrimental impacts on children and individuals.",7.5,some-methods-used-in-advertising-are-unethical-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
948,Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Whether it is appropriate for children to study a foreign language from primary school has long been a hot topic of discussion. While some people oppose the idea of introducing/teaching a foreign language in the primary school, I strongly believe that it is rather beneficial for children to learn a second language from a younger age.
First and foremost, it is widely believed that language learning should start at a relatively younger age. According to scientific studies, language acquisition ability is more prominent when children are still in their early childhood. At this stage, it will take less effort and time for children to master a new language as their linguistic capacity tremendous. By contrast, if a foreign language course had not been introduced until middle school, students would have to spend more time and energy for learning it. What’s more, the language acquisition would not be strong enough because they did not learn it at the right time.
Apart from this, the way we learn a language is somewhat different from the way we learn other subjects. For learning a language, all that we need is to get exposed to it. Since young children have a greater ability to learn languages, exposing them to a second language in the primary school increases their chances of mastering it.
In conclusion, I am deeply convinced that learning a foreign language from primary school has more benefits than drawbacks. However, we should not forget that the elementary school after all is a place where children enjoy their carefree childhood. Parents and educators should hold the right attitude towards language courses and avoid exerting too much pressure on children regarding language learning. A scientific and balanced curriculum should be designed to leverage the benefit brought by early language learning.",7.5,should-children-learn-a-foreign-language-from-primary-school-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
949,Nowadays we are producing more and more rubbish. Why do you think this is happening? What can government do to reduce the amount of rubbish produced? Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The amount of waste produced by households and industries is rising / increasing at an alarming rate. This essay intends to analyze the reasons for this increase in waste production and also suggest some measures to mitigate the problem / improve the situation.
To begin with, increased use of packaged items is one of the main causes of excessive production of rubbish. Companies nowadays use a variety of packaging materials such as plastic, polythene and rubber. Although the packaging makes the item more attractive, the materials used in preparing packets are mostly non-biodegradable and they do not decompose. Since the packaging is always discarded, it increases the production of rubbish.
In addition to this, people nowadays follow the use and throw culture. As companies are now focusing more on creating cheap and disposable products, people now prefer to acquire new things instead of reusing and repairing the old ones. As a result of this mass consumption of new items, the old and used items are discarded leading to the production of more rubbish. Ultimately, such practices cause the production of more non-decomposable waste / garbage.
The solutions are not simple but they do exist. The government should enact strict laws that force companies to use only bio-degradable materials for packaging purposes. In addition to using materials that decompose easily, manufacturers should invent new packaging materials that can be recycled. This will automatically reduce the amount of waste produced. Moreover, the government should encourage people to recycle items that are made of plastic, metals and glass items. For example, recently I read on Facebook about a beach in Australia where machines are installed and people can buy a food item by just submitting used plastic bottles. These kinds of encouragement activities and events can help in persuading people to recycle.
In conclusion, although many reasons such as the use of plastic packaging materials and over consumerism contribute towards the increase in waste production, the government can reduce this growing problem by implementing stringent laws and by promoting recycling.",7.5,we-are-producing-more-rubbish-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
950,The growth in population in cities means that parks should now be used for residential and business purposes. To what extent you agree or disagree?,"Since the population in cities is growing, some people argue that green areas should now be utilized for living and commercial purposes. However, I completely disagree with this view as I feel the parks and gardens in cities are absolutely necessary for the inhabitants.
Firstly, the green areas in big cities cannot be used to cater to the needs of increasing urban population as they play an important role in improving the air quality in cities. Plants in the parks produce oxygen which counteracts against the heavy pollution in metropolis and thus cleans the air. In short, parks are the main source of fresh air in cities and, therefore they are vital for locals.
Another key reason is that gardens in urban areas create a healthy living environment for the residents. People residing in cities often use the parks for various purposes that improve their quality of life. For example, many people in the cities exercise in the parks and this helps them to stay fit. Furthermore, parks are used by kids as a play area for outdoor games. If these parks and gardens are destroyed, there will be an adverse impact on public health.
Finally, the green area in the cities often acts as a natural habitat for the urban wildlife. To illustrate, a report by National Geographic channel stated that parks and gardens in cities are the home of more than hundred species of birds in India. If there were no parks and gardens in cities, it would lead to extinction of these species and other urban wildlife and this might also affect the food chain. Therefore, existence of the green areas in cities is extremely important.
In conclusion, the green areas in metropolitan cities should not be used for residential and commercial purposes as they not only counteract against the heavy pollution in these cities, but also improve the quality of life of the locals. Therefore, I do not agree with this argument that parks in cities should now be used for catering to the needs of their growing population.",7.5,parks-in-cities-should-be-used-for-residential-and-business-purposes-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
951,Some people consider price as the most important thing to consider when buying a product (such as a cell phone) or a service (eg. medical treatment). Do you agree or disagree?,"Price is certainly an important thing to consider while buying a product or service. However, in my opinion, it cannot be the most important consideration.
When two products which serve the exact same purpose are available at different price points, it certainly makes sense to opt for the cheaper product. Take, for instance, the case of smart phones. Some models are ridiculously pricey because of their brand name. There are also considerably cheaper models with similar features and build quality. In this case, by opting for the cheaper model a buyer can save money without compromising on quality. Likewise, there is no point in buying designer garments, bags or shoes for exorbitant prices when similar quality products are available for much less. However, there are some buyers who insist on buying only branded ware. They are not exactly concerned about the usability of the product. They only want to show off and consequently, they show an unhealthy preference for expensive products.
Having said that, sometimes the price of a product/service can be an indication of its quality and in this case opting for the cheaper product will only lead to loss. For example, when it comes to medical treatment, we cannot compromise on quality. Since quality medical care is unlikely to be cheap, this will also mean that we cannot consider the price in this case because opting for cheaper treatment can result in the loss of a precious life.
To conclude, price is just one of the many factors to consider while buying a product. Other factors such as quality and durability are equally important. As for the trend of buying expensive products just to show off, I think it is foolish.

952,"Nowadays technology is increasingly being used to monitor what people are saying and doing (for example, through cell phone tracking and security cameras). In many cases, the people being monitored are unaware that this is happening. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","In the modern world, due to the advancement of technology, we are always being watched. While some people think such monitoring system brings some drawbacks, I support the positive side of it and agree with those who think such technologies are more beneficial.
Those who oppose the digital monitoring technology may argue that such systems infringe on our personal freedom. This is because since our every movement is tracked, some of us may feel uneasy and sometimes even insecure. For example, when we are shopping, the camera installed by the shop owner is recording our every movement.
We sometimes feel uncomfortable as we do not know what they will do with the recording. As a result of all of these nowadays, some people do not prefer to enjoy their leisure time in public places as they used to do in the past.
However, I think that like any other technology this innovation also brings endless benefits to our everyday life. Out of these the most significant one is that it strengthens our security system. For example, unlike a few decades ago, currently, we can refer the CCTV footage to catch a criminal or investigate a crime. Thus we can speed up the investigation process and also make the trial more efficient. Similarly, we can get immediate notification if someone is in danger. Therefore, in my opinion, it makes us feel more secure, rather than insecure.
In conclusion, despite several arguments against digital monitoring system, I strongly support this system as it makes our day-to-day life more secure and boosts efficiency in the security system.",7.5,nowadays-technology-is-increasingly-being-used-to-monitor-people-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
953,"In some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries. Some people think that this is good for a country, while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn. Discuss both views and give your opinion?","There is no doubt that there is a wide range of salaries in some nations nowadays. While some people believe that extremely high remunerations are in favour of a nation, others argue that this trend does more harm than good and hence the government should put a cap on how much one can earn. In this essay I will discuss both sides of the argument (write: the argument) and lend my support for the latter view.
Those who believe that high salary packages are good for a country might support it for various reasons. Firstly, higher salaries would bring a better lifestyle to the country. This is because the money always circulates within the country and keeps changing hands. The more the money in circulation, the more the prosperity. Secondly, they might also argue that a high salary means a better job. For example, the traders in investment banks are the people who make millions of dollars every year and undoubtedly trading is one of the most attractive professions.
On the other hand, I would argue that the free upward movement of salaries should be checked and controlled by the government because of the intense competition it creates along with the huge disparity of incomes in a society. Competitiveness beyond a certain point can make human life awful. This is because people get into the rat race and compare them with others rather than enjoying what they already have. Ultimately, this mentality results in stress and tension. Also, the wide range of income difference can lead to criminal activities. This is due to the fact that poor people would find it extremely difficult to earn higher salaries through legal means, and might get tempted into traps of easy money.
To conclude, although the very high salaries may benefit a certain section of the society, it leads to unhealthy competition and a spurt in criminal activities. Therefore, in my opinion, the advantages of this phenomenon are outweighed by the disadvantages and it is the responsibility of the government to check it.",7.5,in-some-countries-a-few-people-earn-extremely-high-salaries-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
954,"All over the world, the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. What problems does this cause?How can we overcome the problems of poverty?","Poverty continues to be a grave concern throughout the world. In fact, poor people are becoming poorer. This phenomenon will have a negative impact on global economy.
This huge income disparity between the rich and the poor has numerous negative impacts on the society. On the one hand, rich people earn a lot of money and this enables them to have access to the most expensive luxuries of life. On the other hand, throughout their lives poor people struggle to make both ends meet. The enormous gap in the economic conditions has a lot of ramifications for the growth of a nation. There may be a lot of intellectual man-power, hidden talents and skills among the poor, who can definitely outshine the abilities of the rich people, if given a fair chance. These human resources that may significantly contribute to the development of a nation go untapped.
Apart from this, extreme poverty results in an increased crime rate, as individuals putting genuine efforts to raise their living standards get de-moralized when they realize the difference between their living standards and those of rich people. They draw the conclusion that the only way to get richer is by wrong and illegal means.
In order to solve the grave problems caused by poverty, the government must take some proper measures. The rich must also show the willingness to share their wealth with the poor. The government should identify the poor and help them improve their standard of living by offering them food, health care and education for free or at concessional rates. Steps should be taken to educate the rich about the serious setbacks to the nation as a whole due to the non-uniform distribution of wealth among its citizens. The rich should be motivated to voluntarily donate funds towards government schemes so as to provide an opportunity for the poor to acquire a decent living.
In conclusion, it is very important to bridge the gap between the economic conditions of the rich and the poor to ensure consistent growth /development of a nation. Efforts applied in this direction will have long-term benefits that improve the global ranking of a nation.",7.5,rich-are-becoming-richer-and-poor-are-becoming-poorer

Some people think that this is good for a country, while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn. Discuss both views and give your opinion?","Salaries of people working in different professions vary across the countries. A small section of the society take home a handsome salary package but for most of the people the amount of money earned is just sufficient to support their basic requirements. While some people think that the government should cap the amount a person can earn, I do not agree with that view.  In my opinion, when a few people earn large sums of money, it is beneficial for the country.
A group of individuals are of the view that the government should control people’s salaries. They think that by limiting the amount of money which people can earn, a government can reduce the difference between the rich and the poor in a country. Although doing this would reduce the income of those capable of earning high salaries, it would not motivate poor people to put in more efforts to increase their incomes. Hence, I think by controlling the upper limit of salaries, the socio- economic differences between various classes of people cannot be altered to a significant degree.
Conversely, if the government does not control the salaries, it is advantageous for the country. This is because the higher salaries of their peers often motivate people to work hard. Often professionals such as doctors, engineers, chartered accountants and college lecturers earn very good salaries. And it is this handsome salary package which encourages our young adults to study rigorously and work for long hours. It would be unfair not to allow one to earn as per his potential. If people are allowed to earn as per their capabilities, more and more people will be encouraged to pursue professions known for the handsome salary amount. It would result in a country full of professionals. In addition, these people will spend the money they earn and thus increase the economic activity within the country. Therefore, it is definitely beneficial for the country if people are allowed to earn as much as they can.
To conclude, although opinions vary, in my perspective, the government should not control the maximum amount of salary that a person can earn. When a few people earn an exceedingly high salary it is good for the country.",7.5,some-people-think-that-the-government-should-cap-the-salaries-of-people-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Some people think that graduation is the key to getting a good job in the society, while others argue that work experience and soft skills development are even more crucial for a good job. Although practical knowledge is important for a job, I believe that academic qualifications are essential for getting a high-profile job.
On the one hand, some people say that practical experience and soft skills are vital for getting a good job. This is because they can handle a job better than a fresher graduate. They might have faced similar challenges in the past and hence they know how to tackle them. Furthermore, there are a few jobs, which require a good interaction with people. These jobs require candidates who have good communication skills and are able to socialize with others. For instance, marketing sector companies recruit employees who can communicate effectively in front of their clients. However, I think that having only communication skills and training will not guarantee them a good job.
On the other hand, some people think that educational qualifications are necessary to land a good job. This is because big tech companies often look for people who have better academic qualifications and tend to filter out unqualified candidates during the screening process itself. In addition, employers feel that they should have prior knowledge of the subject matter before they join their workforce. For example, many software giants such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft recruit only IT and computer science graduates who can solve their latest business problems. I agree with this approach because qualified professionals can think of multitude ways to solve a problem.
To conclude, although practical exposure can be important in the job market, this does not necessarily guarantee you a good job. At the same time, qualified people are the most sought-after candidates and they get highly paid jobs.",7.5,completing-university-education-is-the-best-way-to-get-a-good-job-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
957,Medical professionals such as doctors and nurses from poorer countries often migrate to richer countries to work. What problems arise from this situation? What measures can be taken to deal with it? Give reasons for your answer and include and relevant examples.,"It is observed that medical professionals migrate to foreign countries for financial reasons. Nowadays, many nurses and doctors leave their home country and settle abroad for work. This situation causes many problems. This essay will discuss what these problems are and possible measures that the government can take to stop them,
Multiple issues arise when these professionals move to a foreign country. First and foremost, the home country loses qualified people. In India, most of the doctors and nurses recently left their home town for better prospects and as such there is a shortage of experienced doctors in many states. Secondly, as these professionals leave their home country there is no one to teach and train the aspiring medical students. Expertise can only be gained with proper training under well qualified and experienced professionals. Thus, lack of experienced people in the medical field may pose a threat to the society as a whole. Though these problems cannot be solved easily, we can definitely offer some solutions.
The most important solution is to offer lucrative benefits in order to stop migration. In addition to this, the government should enforce laws that require these professionals to serve their country for at least 5 years before they migrate. However, this measure may not completely resolve the issue. In addition to enacting laws that check migration, the government should offer qualified doctors and nurses certain tax benefits or loans at subsidised interest rate so that they can open a clinic or a hospital. In other words, by offering financial assistance and enforcing laws that make service in the country mandatory, the government can deal with this issue to a great extent.
To conclude, the migration of doctors and nurses to foreign countries leads to an acute shortage of qualified medical professionals in their home country. The government can arrest this migration by offering better opportunities within the country and also by enforcing laws that make it mandatory for doctors and nurses to serve in the country for at least a few years before moving abroad.",7.5,when-doctors-and-nurses-migrate-what-problems-do-they-cause-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
958,Eating a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. To what extent do you agree?,"It is often thought that consuming nutritious meals / having a balanced diet is the key to a healthy life. I can only partially agree with this opinion because I believe most of the food items nowadays are contaminated with chemicals. Additionally, physical activities have a significant role in keeping our body healthy. In this essay, I will be analysing these points in detail.
Firstly, most of the vegetables, meats and fruits that are available in the market are not healthy due to contamination. Pesticides are applied to the vegetables and fruits during their growth process while most of the meat items are preserved with chemicals. Consequently, these toxic substances reach human body causing many diseases. For instance, a recent study conducted among people who take balanced food revealed that their body had traces of dangerous chemicals.
By contrast, exercise helps to keep our body fit and free from illness. Even if someone eats healthy and balanced food, small amount of fat is still accumulated in the human body. Adequate amount of calories ought to to be burned to get rid of this fat. Physical activities such as swimming, running and weight lifting are extremely helpful. For example, my father used to have high blood pressure and heart issues due to the accumulation of fat in the arteries. The exercise turned out to be highly helpful because as soon as he started getting involved in physical activities his health problems disappeared.
In conclusion, it is imperative that we realize the importance of exercise and regularly engage in physical activities. Depending only on balanced food will not help as food contamination is a reality.",7.5,balanced-diet-is-the-key-for-good-health-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
959,Violence in media promotes violence in society. To what extent do you agree?,"It is often argued that violent programmes on television and the internet influence people to commit crime and incite violence. I completely agree with this opinion. In this essay, I will be analysing the negative impacts of media on the society before arriving at a conclusion.
Firstly, people tend to believe that brutality shown in movies is heroic and they imitate them blindly. Film stars perform stunts and crimes in their movies, making the audience believe that such activities are essential to become a super human. Viewers are influenced when they watch actors perform violent activities on screen. For example, there are many reports of people committing crimes as a result of watching crime thriller films. These audience turned criminals plot their brutal acts by imitating what they saw in such movies.
Secondly certain kind of media allows people to form groups, which can be misused as a platform to spread hatred among people. Social media such as Facebook and Whatsapp have features that allow users to communicate and spread violence without any censorship. Issues like religious intolerance and racial discrimination often hurt individual sentiments. Consequently, people become selfish and they start hating each other. For example, nowadays, terrorists use social media to brainwash people to perform violent activities such as bombing and explosions.
In conclusion, different forms of media like movies and social media promote brutality as people get inspired and brainwashed by its contents.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-violence-in-media-promotes-violence-in-society
960,"Some people think that older school children should learn a wide range of subjects to acquire more knowledge, while other people believe they should learn a small number of subjects in detail. Discuss both views and give your opinions.","Some people insist that schools should offer comprehensive education which covers a variety of subjects, but others opine that studying a small range of subjects in depth gives students more benefits.
On the one hand, comprehensive education helps realise students’ interests and potentials. Comprehensive education offers students a wide range of subjects, from which they can easily find out where their interests and potentials are.
Students, especially senior school students, have to choose what to study at university so it is necessary for them to identify their true interests and goals. For example, if students have learned both science and arts subjects, they could easily decide whether they should choose biology or sociology as their majors at university.
On the other hand, senior students who study specific subjects in depth stand a better chance of finding a good job. Learning specific subjects in detail can help students develop specific skills, which are essential for finding a job. More specifically, the student who is studying Java or C++ subjects deeply will have a higher chance of getting hired as a software engineer than their counterparts who just study general science courses.
On balance, for the comprehensive development of students, the school should not only provide a well-rounded education, but also offer a few elective subjects for students to develop in-depth knowledge. For example, in China, most public senior high schools provide students with the N+1 model, which means various foundation subjects plus one specific subject. This model helps students find their interests as well as develop the skills needed for job search. This model has been awarded as one of the most successful education models in China.",7.5,senior-school-students-should-learn-a-wide-range-of-subjects-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample

While it may have a few advantages, I believe that the disadvantages of this extended contact after office hours and even on holidays outweigh any possible benefit.
There are only a few positive aspects to being able to contact employees at at all times. It allows smooth flow of information between colleagues and enhances their coordination. It may be necessary in the case of people working in fields such as police department or emergency health care. In these occupations it may be pertinent to obtain certain pieces of information from employees immediately, and one cannot wait for their vacations to get over. However, only a handful of jobs would necessitate such a situation.
Conversely, there are numerous drawbacks to being in constant touch with one’s official colleagues. Invariably, such flexibility results in employers repeatedly contacting their workers beyond their stipulated official hours for trivial things. The result in that some employees are never able to take work off their minds even during holidays. Their mind is constantly thinking of some official work or the other. This leads to unnecessary stress among employees. And their work efficiency reduces drastically. Furthermore, being in constant touch with colleagues through phone or emails hampers the family relationships and the social life of most people. This adds to their stress levels leading to further decline in their work output. Hence, such frequent contacts are not beneficial for either employees or employers.
To conclude, in my perspective, barring a few professions, employers should not be encouraged to contact their workers after office hours.

While some people think that most celebrities are famous just for their wealth and glamour, and that they negatively influence our younger generation, I disagree with this view. In my opinion, although some celebrities try to achieve name and fame through short cut, not all of them are in the limelight for superficial things like money or glamour.
It cannot be denied that certain celebrities adopt quick methods to become famous. For example, certain film stars wear glamorous or revealing dresses either in their movies or during social gatherings to grab attention. Some also flaunt their ancestral money. These tactics can bring them lots of attention. Such celebrities may come across as a bad role model for young people. However, fortunately, often name and fame achieved through such means is short lasting. Most of them disappear from the limelight in the blink of an eye.
Conversely, not all celebrities are alike. Many of them put in years of hard work and face long lasting struggle to reach their current status.  For instance, many movie artists and social activists are world famous for their struggles and resultant achievement. The example of the youngest Nobel Prize winner Ms. Malala, can illustrate it extremely well. She has spent many years working for the protection and empowerment of women and children. She was once fatally attacked by militants but she did not give up. She is now an inspiration of millions of women across the world. Hence, there are many famous personalities who have become famous due to years of strenuous work and their achievement. Such celebrities also act as good role models for our society. They encourage young minds to focus on working for the betterment of themselves and the society.
To conclude, in my perspective, although a certain number of celebrities become famous using superficial ways, a large number of world renowned people come to limelight due to their work and achievement.

963,"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?","There has been an increase in the number of crimes committed by criminals once they are out of the prison. This is mainly happening because the laws are not stricter and I believe stricter punishments should be enforced to deal with this problem.
The reason why offenders repeatedly commit crime is that laws are not stringent in many countries. These criminals easily find the loop holes in the legislations and utilize those to come out of the jail. As a result, they are not afraid to commit the crime again, thinking that they can easily get off. For instance, in India, many criminals commit crimes but they roam free within a few days of getting convicted. Thus it is clear that the loopholes in legislation are the main reason offenders commit crimes more often.
The best way to reduce the crime rate is for governments to impose stricter punishments on the criminals. This action creates a sense of fear among those who commit premeditated crimes. If they realize the consequences, they will never try to commit crime again. Take the UAE, for example, where punishments, such as stone pelting and hanging to death in front of the public are so common and this immensely helped to curb the crime rates. This nation has recorded the lowest crime figures compared to any other nation in the world.
To conclude, the crime rate is definitely on the rise because of the weaker laws existing in practice, but this problem can be significantly reduced, if governments award capital punishments for the offenders. I hope in the future crime rates will be reduced and the world will be a better place to live in.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-many-criminals-commit-crimes-after-serving-punishment
964,Some people think that they should not have to pay any tax and should be able to keep all the money that they earn. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Every individual works very hard to earn a living, and therefore they are unhappy about having to pay a part of their income to the government. Many people are of the opinion that they have the right to enjoy their hard earned money without paying tax. In my opinion, although it may seem to be unfair, tax payment is very essential and plays a significant role in the economic development of the nation.
To begin with, the government needs funds to discharge its numerous responsibilities for the development of the country and the betterment of the society. Administration, defense and infrastructure development all come within the purview of these responsibilities. These services are of utmost importance and would eventually prove to be advantageous for the people of the country as this money would return to them in some form of service. Therefore, people are the real beneficiaries when the nation develops and because of this reason they should pay taxes.
In addition to this, there is a limit to what an individual can achieve on their own. The government, by contrast, is capable of doing a lot for the country and hence it needs money.  These funds can only be generated by the taxes paid by its citizens. For example, national defense provides security for the people. For defending people, it needs to be ready with the arms and ammunitions. The money for these demands can only be raised by the taxes paid by the citizens from their earnings. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the individual to contribute to the social and economic progress of the country.

How far do you agree or disagree with this argument.,"People’s opinion seems to differ as to whether or not museums should charge a fee for allowing visitors to enter. While some people argue that the entry should be free to such places, I strongly believe that a charge should be levied for the entry.
There are myriad reasons to advocate the entry fees for the museums. First and foremost, a museum is a place where artifacts from the past civilizations are exhibited. Hence, to maintain and preserve them from dust and decaying, a maintenance fee is collected from the visitors. Secondly, an entrance ticket filters out unnecessary crowd from entering the museum premises. It actually discourages the uninterested and anti-social elements of the society such as beggars and vagabonds from entering.
Furthermore, most of the museums offer world class facilities such as air conditioned halls, safe drinking water, cafes and seating arrangements for visitors. Such facilities are not possible without collecting a fee from the public. In addition, a museum may need to upgrade its technology and add more to its existing collection from time to time.
Finally, a museum reflects the traditions, cultures and beliefs of a bygone-era. Therefore it becomes imperative to maintain it with the best possible facilities and latest technology. It is often seen that well maintained museums are thronged by the local people as well as tourists and thus they boost economy of a nation.

966,Artists need a certain amount of freedom to develop their creativity. Some people think that artists should have total freedom to express any thoughts and ideas. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Artistic creations are often the subject of many public debates and controversies. Some individuals think that to bring out their creativity, artists should be given complete freedom of expression. I, however, disagree with this view and believe that only a certain degree of freedom is necessary and should be given.
Allowing complete freedom to express artistic thought and ideas has many drawbacks. Art pieces often deals with subjects such as religion and history which have high emotional significance for many groups of people. If such things are not taken into account, art works are likely to draw widespread criticism and public outrages. For instance, a few years ago, the nude portrayal of a Hindu goddess by a famous Indian painter provoked widespread outrage in the country. Hence, artists should not be given total freedom to express their thoughts and feelings.
Conversely, a certain degree of freedom is necessary for the development and expression of creativity. Artistic creativity involves making new, innovative works of arts. Without providing them an encouraging environment and a certain degree of freedom, an artist cannot be expected to develop masterpieces of art. Hence, it is essential to provide such an environment which encourages the formation of new ideas in the artistic brain. If we compare the artistic works of different nations we can easily find out how freedom or the lack of it affects the quality of the artistic creations.  Needless to say, the countries that give considerable amount of freedom to their artists are the ones that have always been able to produce masterpieces. This is not the case in societies which are extremely orthodox and impose unnecessary restrictions on their artists. Therefore, certain degree of freedom is vital.
To conclude, in my perspective, an artist should not be given complete freedom of expression as this can disrupt the peace and harmony of a nation. However, certain degree of freedom is necessary to encourage artistic expression.",7.5,some-people-think-that-artists-should-be-given-total-freedom-band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample
967,Solar energy is becoming more and more popular as a source of household energy in many countries around the world. Why is this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy?,"These days, the consumption of renewable energy such as solar is growing in many countries. Solar energy gained more popularity all around the world over the past two decades because of its unlimited benefits. This essay will discuss the pros and cons of solar energy and also the need to promote it.
It is a fact that scientists particularly those in developed countries are attempting to replace non renewable sources with renewable sources of energy. Solar energy is the most prominent among them. It is a proven fact that solar energy is a highly efficient source of energy that can be used to run a variety of household appliances without causing any harm to the environment. Compared to conventional resources like gasoline or coal which goes extinct with time, solar energy is never depleted. Hence its popularity is growing.
There are multiple reasons to promote solar energy. To begin with, its consumption requires only one time investment. For instance, to have a solar inverter, solar panels need to be installed at home. Since these panels do not require any maintenance, their upfront cost is easily justified. Secondly, solar power is unlimited. To cite an example, as per a recent survey, it was proved that only a fraction of solar energy is being utilized by mankind for his benefits. If we utilize it to its full extent, scarcity of resources will be a thing of past.
On the down side, solar has a few disadvantages as well. Firstly, solar energy will not be available in some western countries which are away from the equator where winter prevails throughout the year. They cannot benefit from this inexhaustible source of energy. For example, solar cannot be a source of energy in countries like Canada, Norway or Sweden. Secondly, its installation costs people a small fortune which everyone cannot afford, particularly, people in underdeveloped or developing countries like India.
To conclude, considering all points it is not hard to see that solar energy is the most efficient form of energy that can be used for household purposes. However, it does have a few downsides, but in my opinion, the popularity of solar energy will only increase in the coming years.",7.5,solar-energy-is-becoming-more-popular-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
968,Today many countries import food from different parts of the world. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.,"Due to globalization, trade is flourishing and many consumer goods are being traded across the globe. It has been noticed that even food is being imported from or exported to different countries. In my opinion, the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages. To begin with, the import and export of food materials provides people with an opportunity to taste exotic foods and cuisines.
Some fruits and vegetables can only be grown in specific regions. By importing them, people living in other parts of the world can also enjoy them. For example, kiwi fruit cannot be produced in India, but all Indians can still enjoy the fruit, thanks to imports. Moreover, this trend gives the poor, developing countries an opportunity to earn foreign exchange by selling their rare products to the world. This eventually helps those countries economically.
On the flip side, the importing and exporting of food does have a few downsides. To start with, imported food is not always healthy. As those food materials have to be transported over long distances, they are preserved with the help of chemicals to increase their shelf life. These preservatives are sometimes carcinogenic and could cause dreadful diseases like cancer. Thus, they are a potential threat to the health of the people. Furthermore, the importing of food can weaken the economy of poor countries.
To conclude, although imported food is not always healthy, the import and export of food products is an opportunity for sellers to earn valuable foreign exchange and for buyers to enjoy exotic foods all year round. As for the health consequences, well, healthier preservatives may be available in near future.",7.5,today-many-countries-import-food-from-different-parts-of-the-world-ielts-essay-sample
969,Nowadays many young people are attracted to dangerous sports. What makes these activities so attractive? What measures should be taken to regulate such sports and minimize their risks?,"The craze for adventurous and thrilling sports is increasing day by day and attracting a lot of young people. Youngsters most often get attracted and try these sports without being aware of the dangers involved. To reduce the risk, sports agencies or the government can certainly take a few measures.
Youngsters are adventurous and courageous. They always love to try all the sports for the thrill and to gain experience without even thinking about the consequences. Social media is one of the reasons that get them attracted to these sports because teenagers usually take pictures while they participate in the adventurous sports and upload them to the internet to gain more likes and followers. In addition, adventurous sports need a lot of concentration, so they do not think of any other issues while participating in them and get relieved of stress. Therefore, they actively participate in the dangerous sports, so as to get that adrenaline rush of excitement and enjoyment.
In order to prevent the risks associated with these sports, a set of safety guidelines should be handed to all the participants beforehand. The organizing team should be well trained and certified to teach participants all the required skills to handle any difficult situation. The concerned team should accurately check the health condition of the people and the equipment to avoid mishaps. A rescue team must be available in case of any mishaps.
In conclusion, it is always fascinating for youngsters to participate in thrilling sports when they get a chance, but they should be physically fit and get proper training to reduce the risk factors.",7.5,nowadays-many-young-people-are-attracted-to-dangerous-sports-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
970,"Some people say that in all levels of education, from primary school to universities, too much time is spent on learning facts and not enough learning practical skills. Do you agree or disagree.","Due to growing competition, schools and colleges are giving emphasis on quality education. While some people argue that the students are being taught more theoretical knowledge and facts I believe that practical skills are also an equally important part of their curriculum.
There are numerous reasons to believe that practical knowledge is being imparted to pupils. To begin with, most of the educational institutions, mandate practical as well as theoretical learning. In fact both these are part of compulsory education and equal weight age is given to them during exams. Secondly, the governments around the world understand the importance of practical skills in today’s evolving world; hence the students are provided with dedicated hours for experimenting with the theories and facts they learned in the classroom. For example, biology students also get lab hours when they can dissect living organisms such as frogs and mice to learn more about the anatomy of living organisms.
Thirdly, it is a well-known fact that no knowledge is complete without its practical as well as theory side. Thus taking this into consideration, the universities and colleges do not award their degrees before a student successfully completes their final leg of study with a firm and gains practical / work experience. For example, engineering students must do on-the-job training for a few weeks in a company before they are presented with a degree.
Therefore, to encapsulate, I assert that most educational institutions understand that both aspects of learning are equally important for the youngsters and hence they provide facts and practical skills to the students without depriving them of either.",7.5,too-much-time-is-spent-on-learning-facts-in-all-levels-of-education-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
971,People find it very difficult to speak in public or to give a presentation before an audience. Do you think public speaking skill is really very important? Give reasons. Some people say that public speaking should be taught at school. Do you agree or disagree?,"Public speaking and oratory are valuable skills that one should have. A good orator can easily win an argument, get their message across and enjoy immense popularity among people. Unfortunately, many people lack this skill and therefore there is an argument that it should be taught at schools. I agree with this view. In this essay, I shall explain why good public speaking skills are important in life.
The major argument in favor of public speaking is that it develops one’s personality. When a person successfully delivers a good speech, it enhances his sense of self-worthiness. A positive response from the audience can help him to develop confidence. More than that, it improves relationships. A marked improvement can be seen in his interpersonal skills which, in turn, will help him maintain healthy relation with friends, family and his colleagues at work. In addition, it acts as a stress buster for an individual and will help him overcome his stage fear or shyness.
Since good public speaking skills are essential for success in personal and professional life, I agree with the argument that they should be taught in schools. The standard school curriculum now focuses more on reading and writing. Consequently, speaking does not get the importance it deserves. This should change. Schools can organize various programmes that give students an opportunity to express their ideas in front of an audience. For example, there could be elocution and story telling competitions. Many schools already offer them as non-curricular activities, but in my opinion they should be made a part of the curriculum.
In conclusion, the art of public speaking is very important in today’s scenario. If children acquire this skill, they will stand a much better chance in the highly competitive job market.",7.5,people-find-it-very-difficult-to-speak-in-public-or-to-give-a-presentation-before-an-audience-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
972,Many people believe that mobile phones cause more harms than the benefits and that’s why mobile phones should be restricted? To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons to support.,"Availability of newer and advanced versions of smart phones has led to an increasingly large number of people using them. Many people insist that these communication tools are more dangerous than beneficial and therefore, their use should be limited / discouraged. In my opinion, although use of mobile phones may prove to be risky under certain situations, overall they are a compulsory mode of communication and thus they are a necessity. Therefore, restricting their usage is completely unwarranted.
It is undoubtedly true that under some circumstances, using mobile phones can put the safety of a person in danger. In other words, there are certain situations where using cell phone is inappropriate and may result in the occurrence of grievous accidents or major injuries. Talking on phone or texting while driving may divert the driver’s attention and consequently he becomes less conscious /aware of the presence of other vehicles or people on the road. This often results in fatal accidents.
On the flip side, there is a strong argument against banning / restricting handsets. Firstly, a smart phone can prove to be a saviour in the event of unpredicted natural calamities like earthquakes. Under such conditions, a hand-held device facilitates communication between survivors and the rescue team. Likewise, availability of many navigation apps on modern smart phones may help lost travellers find the right direction. This often proves to be the difference between life and death.
Additionally, since most of smart phones are now equipped with the internet, we can perform various laborious tasks more efficiently. A mobile phone with high-speed internet connection not only saves time but also eliminates the need to travel. For instance, by using a smart phone a passenger can book the railway ticket from the convenience of his home. Also, these days, many financial transactions can be carried out on cell phone and this has eliminated the need to visit the bank.
In conclusion, I am of the view that even though the use of a handset may be dangerous in some cases, banning it is completely preposterous. In fact, mobile phones facilitate communication and increase our efficiency to perform many mundane tasks. If the users try to use the device more responsibly, it would prove to be a boon and not a bane.",7.5,many-people-believe-that-mobile-phones-cause-more-harms-than-the-benefits-band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample
973,Some people think basic healthcare should be free for everyone. Others believe people should pay their own medical costs. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.,"It is undoubtedly true that adequate healthcare is of extreme importance in the life of a person. Some people think that it must be free of charge for everybody. Others, however, believe that it is the responsibility of an individual to bear the entire cost involved in availing themselves of medical treatments and facilities.
It can be argued that a citizen pays a hefty sum of money as tax and so, authorities must provide all the treatment free of cost. While this can be true to a certain extent, I am of the opinion that being responsible for one’s medical expenditure can perhaps make a person more conscious of their health.
The affluent sections of the society pay a huge amount of tax to the government. The modern workforce, particularly those working in the public sector pay this sum from their monthly salary. Since this money is collected from the people, the government should certainly use it to provide various public services. So it seems that the demand for making fundamental health care free of cost is reasonable / justifiable.
On the flip side, there is a strong argument in favour of making individuals responsible for their healthcare. Once a person pays the exorbitant prescription and treatment charges he becomes wary of the expenses involved in the process. As a result, he makes conscious efforts to keep himself fit and healthy. For instance, in India many people do regular exercise and yoga just to avoid the huge treatment charges. Additionally, when people are responsible for their medical expenses, more and more of them will want to lead a healthy lifestyle. Having said that, the government must step in to help those who cannot afford to pay their medical bills.
In conclusion, I am of the view that although we pay massive amount of money in the form of tax, paying for our own treatment definitely helps in keeping us healthy and fit.",7.5,some-people-think-basic-healthcare-should-be-free-for-everyone-ielts-essay-sample
974,Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"It is a fact that several languages have become extinct over the years. A bunch of people state that there is nothing to panic about the extinction of some languages around the world. They add that if there are fewer languages in the world, life will be more convenient. Although the disappearance of a language has a negative impact on the society whose mother tongue it is, I personally believe that having only a limited number of languages in the planet can help us in many aspects of life, and it should be considered as a positive development.
No doubt the main purpose of a language is to facilitate communication between people. With the help of language people can easily express their thoughts and feelings toward each other. Hence, using fewer languages, such as English, French or Spanish would improve the way people around the world communicate.  That is to say, in the era of globalization where geographical boundaries are becoming insignificant, it is beneficial to have fewer international languages in the world. This trend will help people to socialize and understand one another.
Moreover, utilizing fewer formal languages can foster businesses and commerce which will in turn improve the economy of a nation. Additionally, it has another priceless merit. It helps fortify education and enables the sharing of knowledge between various nations. For example, the majority of research papers and articles on different subjects around the world are written in the English language. Thus if someone knows English, they can access all of this information.
Nonetheless, the extinction of a lot of languages over the centuries means a disappearance of their cultures and civilizations. Thus, a lot of traditional myths, beliefs and valuable knowledge of various civilizations have vanished. Even so, in my opinion, the benefits of using one or two common languages outweigh the drawbacks if any.
In conclusion, I do believe that using fewer languages is essential to promote mutual understanding and knowledge sharing. Despite the fact that the annihilation of a lot of languages in the world leads to evanescence of irreplaceable civilizations, I assert that utilizing fewer languages in the era of globalization is crucial for improving the economy and education.",7.5,every-year-several-languages-die-out-some-people-think-that-this-is-not-important-ielts-essay-sample

Send us your writing samples for a free band score estimate or get a detailed analysis of your writing for a fee.,"Special gifts are as precious as treasures. Often times it is not the value of the gift that makes it special – rather it is the kindness and thoughtfulness of the person who gives it.
Special gifts create unforgettable memories and that is why they are remembered for a long time. They add a mesmerising effect to the occasion at which people receive them. Gifts are usually given on special days like birthdays, weddings and anniversaries. Although these days are special in their own right, a gift adds more value to them. Thus, they turn out to be unforgettable moments for us.
I remember one such day in my life. It happened to be August 10, 2016. On this day I delivered my first baby and my husband gifted me with a new house. I cannot describe that moment in words when I received such astonishing gifts- a baby and a house. I will remember that day as long as I live. Thus it is evident that gifts add value to an already valued and special event.
What’s more some gifts are imperishable. People may die but their gifts make them live on. A special gift reminds us of those who gifted them. For example, my mother-in-law had gifted my husband a wrist watch. She has died but whenever my husband wears this precious gift, he talks about her. Thus, her gift keeps her memory alive.
Special gifts like books and CDs ease our life. Such gifts act as our best friends. They guide us through thick and thin and offer a glimmer of light in darkness. A friend of mine had gifted me a book on my wedding day called “Life After Marriage”. This book narrates about problems one may face after marriage and their solutions. This book acts as my mother. It guides me how to deal with the problems in the same way my mother will guide me.
To conclude special gifts are special and unforgettable because they have a sentimental value.",7.5,people-who-receive-special-gifts-remember-them-long-why
976,"Large businesses have big budgets for marketing and promotion and as a result, people gravitate towards buying their products. What problems does this cause? What could be done to encourage them to buy local products?","Marketing and promotion of products are an integral part of running a business and large companies invest enormous amounts of money in them. Because of this, the sale of the products increases causing numerous problems like excessive shopping of unwanted things as well as the collapse of small and local businesses.
These are some problems associated with excessive marketing and promotion of the products. Firstly, the product which is being advertised regularly becomes popular among the common people and they ultimately buy it even if they do not really need it. As a result, common people may sometimes face financial crisis. For instance, some large companies make offers like ‘Buy 2 shirts and get 1 free’. Tempted by this offer, people buy three shirts when in fact they needed only one.
Moreover, dazzled by the advertisements, offers and promotions people often forget the quality of the product. Often they spend huge amounts of money to buy goods of sub-standard quality and thus they get duped.
Furthermore, excessive sale of large business sector products reduces the market of local shops and trades. Small scale business men cannot afford big budget marketing and promotions and thus their products do not have many buyers. Consequently, they are forced to shut shop. Since they will have a negative impact on the local economy, steps should be taken to expand the business of local products. Firstly, the government should give monetary help in the form of loans. Secondly, local businesses should also give proper attention to the quality of the product so that they can compete with other branded commodities. Last but not least, common people should also take active steps to encourage the local trade and business. They can discard international branded products for the sake of local trade.
To summarise, excessive marketing and promotions have some downsides. They encourage people to buy products they do not want; also, they cause the downfall of local businesses. However, the government can help local businesses by giving them monetary assistance and encouraging people to buy their products. In addition, local businesses should enhance the quality of their products.",7.5,people-are-buying-products-of-large-businesses-what-problems-does-this-cause-ielts-essay-sample
977,"The best way for governments to solve the problem of traffic congestion is to provide free public transport 24 hours a day, seven days a week. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is no denying the fact that traffic congestion has become a major problem in most metro cities. Critics argue that if the government provides free transportation to their people, it will substantially reduce the traffic related issues. Although I agree with this opinion, I also believe that this proposal could jeopardise a country’s growth over a period of time.
On the one hand, free transportation would largely reduce the use of personal vehicles. One of the primary reasons for this heavy traffic in the cities is because of the use of personal cars. A growing number of people are using their own cars heavily to commute to work, for shopping malls, and other daily activities. If the government offers free transport to their people, there is a good chance that the number of vehicles on the roads will be reduced. Hence it is evident that the free public transport idea is not a bad solution for the traffic problem.
On the other hand, the free transport proposal could jeopardise a country’s progress severely despite having above-mentioned positives. In many countries, the revenue from public transport is absolutely imperative for the development of other critical sectors, namely health and education. If public transport is made free, the loss of revenue will impact these sectors and over time it will affect the progress of the country. Hence there is convincing evidence that the free transport idea has its own negatives.
In conclusion, indeed, traffic congestion is a big concern in almost all the cities. While I agree with the proposal that the free of cost public transport would reduce the traffic problems enormously, I also believe that the negative implications of this idea are severe and cannot be overlooked. I would suggest / recommend that other viable options should be explored to control this menace effectively.",7.5,the-best-way-to-solve-traffic-problems-is-to-provide-free-public-transport-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
978,Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.,"The subjects chosen at university can play a crucial role in the life of a student. Many people are of the view that only subjects which can be utilized vocationally should be chosen. However, I believe that students should be allowed to study the subjects of their choice.
To begin with, many individuals think that students should choose subjects which are useful for their future life and career. This is because studying in institutes of higher learning requires significant financial investment. In addition, often many years of learning are needed to acquire a university degree. Hence, many people expect immediate monetary returns for their strenuous efforts. One way of getting it is by choosing a subject such as science and technology which can be utilized for finding a good job immediately after completing one’s course. Furthermore, some people think that only newer scientific innovations and latest technology are necessary for a society to advance.
However, in my opinion, students should not be compelled to choose any specific subject. Not all students are alike. Their interests, aptitudes and inclinations vary widely. Forcing students to study subjects which do not interest them will only burden them. What’s more, they will not be able to understand the subject well and will not be able to utilize it in future. Moreover, in addition to scientists and technology experts, our society requires scholars who excel in philosophy, arts, politics, accounts etc. For a society to truly progress, scholars with varied backgrounds and expertise are needed.
To conclude, in my perspective, students should be given the opportunity to learn subjects of their interest/ choice. This is because doing this will be beneficial for the students as well as the society.",7.5,students-should-only-learn-science-and-technology-at-university-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
979,Nowadays people have free access to online movies and music. Is this a positive development or negative one?,"There is a drastic increase in the number of people who watch movies and listen to music online because of free access to this content. Personally, I believe this is a negative development which can lead to time wastage, inefficient use of human energy and potentially insignificant utilization of the internet data.
The biggest downside to the easy access of movies online is that it makes people unproductive. When they should be doing something productive that would help themselves and their country, they are wasting their precious time watching nonsensical movies online. They know that these useless videos will not help them in any way, yet they watch them for hours on end because they provide entertainment. Unfortunately, this unproductive activity certainly reduces the amount of time they get to study or work.
Watching online videos for a long time can also be detrimental to health. In other words, sitting idle doing nothing but clicking the mouse button can hurt the fitness level of a person. This is particularly bad for the youth who needs to utilize their boundless energy for something productive/healthy. For example, they could volunteer for a charity or hit the gym when they get free time.
Another issue associated with watching too many online movies is that this practice leads to the wastage of useful bandwidth. The internet data is a valuable resource. Using it merely for entertainment is a wasteful venture especially since it can be used in much more productive ways.  That is to say, this data can be utilized to enhance knowledge and skill by watching knowledgeable videos.
In conclusion, although it has become more popular for people to entertain themselves through the internet, it has brought about too many problems for this to be considered a positive trend.",7.5,nowadays-people-have-free-access-to-online-movies-and-music-band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample
980,Some students work while studying. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this trend and give your opinion?,"More and more students now do part time jobs while they are still at university. In my opinion, working while studying can be hugely rewarding; however, it does have some drawbacks as well.
The biggest advantage of doing a part time job is that it makes a student independent. It boosts their self confidence and promotes growth. Moreover by working, they can fund their studies. For instance, they do not have to depend on parents for pocket money or to fulfill any extra need. Apart from this, working part time makes them understand the importance and value of money. For example, when they toil hard and save money for purchasing an item, they learn to value money and use it wisely. Better still, they will learn to respect all labour.
However, working while studying has some disadvantages as well. The biggest disadvantage is that it will distract students from their studies. Some students may even drop out of college. Unfortunately, this affects their career prospects because it is not possible for someone who does not have a degree to get a high paying job. By the time they realize this it will be too late. At least some of these disappointed students may indulge in illegal activities to make money quickly.
To sum up, I admit that there are several benefits to working while studying. However, only those students who are serious about their studies should be encouraged to work part time. Otherwise, they may drop out spoiling their career prospects.",7.5,some-students-work-while-studying
981,Everybody should be allowed admission to university study programs regardless of their academic ability. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?,"Securing admission in institutes of higher learning is often dependent on the merits and academic abilities of the student. Some argue that all students should have the opportunity to study in universities irrespective of their knowledge and skills. I disagree with this argument and believe that admission should be merit based.
To begin with, the most sought after academic courses often have limited seats, and hence all applicants cannot be admitted. This is not surprising, though. Unlike schools which admit all students, universities are for specialized learning. Therefore, universities use certain selection criteria such as academic qualifications and other skills to decide whether a student is eligible for admission. This will, of course, mean that only the meritorious can secure admission. For instance, a recent survey in ‘The Hindu’ revealed that in India only 10% of those applying for engineering courses are able to secure a place for themselves.
Another reason not to admit all students is that university programmes require students to demonstrate a certain level of intellectual capacity. Not everybody can become a doctor or a scientist even if seats are available. Moreover, a student who is not capable of learning a specific subject will not benefit from joining it. For example, a student who has no aptitude for medicine or engineering will not benefit from joining a medical college or engineering college. If they do, they will not be able to learn the concepts or put them into practice. This will be a sheer wastage of valuable resources. Hence it is evident that if a student joins a course which he is not capable of comprehending, it will benefit neither him nor the society.
To conclude, in my opinion, admission to universities should be based on the academic credentials of the students. Only then will our universities be able to produce high achievers who can contribute something to the society.",7.5,everybody-should-be-allowed-admission-to-university-study-programs-regardless-of-their-academic-ability-band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample
982,Every year several languages die out. Some people think that it is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Many languages that were once in use have become defunct / extinct now. Some people argue that fewer languages make the world an easier place to live in. In my opinion, a few common languages for the entire world can make people’s lives easier; however, saving minority languages along with their culture will make the world an interesting place.
The existence of only a few common languages certainly makes life easier for people. When people of different countries speak a common language, it makes traveling and trading easier. For instance, while traveling to a foreign country such as Thailand people struggle to navigate their way to the hotel or various tourist attractions in the country because many local people don’t speak any language other than their mother tongue. In addition, starting a new business and running it successfully in a foreign country is difficult due to the language barrier. In my personal experience, as a business man from India I found it difficult to run my new business in Indonesia as most of my customers could not speak English. Thus it is evident that speaking a few common languages will make the world an easier place to live in.
On the other hand, one beautiful thing about this world is its diversity in culture and languages. As people adopt one common language and refuse to speak and study their own language, the world is losing its diversity. Losing a language means losing a culture as well; therefore it is important to save languages to make the world a beautiful and multicultural place.
In conclusion, minority languages are disappearing from the world because their own speakers refuse to learn and speak them. At the same time, languages like English are becoming more and more popular. In my opinion, it is true that a few common languages for the entire world can make people’s life less complicated; however, saving dying languages along with their culture can make world a beautiful place to live in.",7.5,every-year-several-languages-die-out-some-people-think-that-it-is-not-important-because-life-will-be-easier-if-there-are-fewer-languages-in-the-world-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
983,It seems clear that obesity in today’s society is to some extent due to the availability of fast food. Should governments place a tax on fast food to reduce the amount of fast food consumed?,"The easy accessibility of junk food these days is the root cause of the problems like obesity. Some people demand that the government should impose extra tax on fast food to reduce its consumption. In my opinion, taxing is not the only option and there are several other measures which should also be considered.
Nowadays, fast foods are available at every corner of the street and that too at an affordable price. As a result, a number of children and adults consume these easily available products on a large scale. Therefore, the government should impose heavy tax on all junk food items and also enact laws that limit the number of fast food joints in a particular neighbourhood.
This step will make fast food more expensive than healthy food and it will also limit its availability. Furthermore, the government should come up with new campaigns that create awareness about the ingredients of various junk food items so that people can understand what they are consuming and what the health consequences will be.
Public awareness is an essential step to minimising consumption of unhealthy food items as people should understand the calorie value and harmful effects of the items they consume. In order to create awareness, the government should ask all junk food producers to mention the nutritional values and calories on the packets of their products. Thus, it will help buyers to understand the harmful effects of fast food. For instance, a diabetic patient will refrain from buying products with higher sugar content if the amount of added sugar is mentioned / printed on the label.
In conclusion, obesity is a major health problem that affects our generation and it must be addressed as early as possible. However, increasing tax on fast food alone will not help. The government has to take some other measures too.",7.5,it-seems-clear-that-obesity-in-todays-society-is-to-some-extent-due-to-the-availability-of-fast-food-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
984,The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflect this. To what extent so you agree?,"It is often argued that preventing health issues and diseases is better than treating them and hence the government should allocate appropriate budget for it. I completely agree with this view as it will help maintain a healthy lifestyle and save money on medical expenses in the future. Better still, a healthy population is happier and more productive.
Firstly, if the government spends more money on promoting prevention methods it can encourage people to live a good and stress free life. In other words, if a person wants to live a healthy life he needs to prevent himself from indulging in bad habits such as eating fast food etc. However, individual efforts alone will not help. The government should also invest in highlighting the benefits of a healthy lifestyle by launching health awareness campaigns.
Secondly, if the government gives more importance towards highlighting benefits of prevention it can help people save a lot of money on medical expenses. This is because by taking prevention measures people will not fall ill, thus saving money which would otherwise have been spent on medical treatment. For example, there has been a 10 percent reduction in the sale of cigarettes in India, after the Indian government launched a campaign highlighting the health consequences of smoking at all major bus and train stations. This has helped people save money which otherwise could have gone into treating illnesses related to smoking.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that authorities should spend more on encouraging prevention as it will help people to stay healthy save money on medical bills.",7.5,the-prevention-of-health-problems-and-illness-is-more-important-than-treatment-and-medicine-band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
985,Artists need a certain amount of freedom to develop their creativity. Some people think that artists should have total freedom to express any thoughts and ideas. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Artists require the freedom of expression to some extent to develop innovative ideas. Some people argue that full freedom to express any opinion or ideas need to be given to artists. In my opinion, artists should be given enough freedom to express their ideas but total freedom is not required.
Artists should have the liberty to express their views and original ideas without having to worry about the consequences. When they have the freedom to express, more and more people will turn to arts and this will enrich our culture and civilisation. Moreover, many artists highlight several social issues and they spread awareness among the masses. Many of them stand for social justice. After a rape case of an 8 year old girl in India, many people expressed their anger and emotions through songs and these songs became viral on social media. Thus it aroused feelings of many people and the authorities were forced to take immediate action against the criminals.
However, the art works should not have any destructive impact on the society. There have been several incidences where artworks like paintings created tension and violence. For example M F Hussain’s paintings of nude Indian Goddesses created chaos among Hindu people. In addition to this, objectifying women in various art works may negatively influence children and teenagers. They may see women as mere objects of lust and fail to respect them. In other words, creating negative emotions through art increases the crime and violence in the society and can lead to many problems.
To conclude, some amount of freedom is necessary for artists to thrive; however, total freedom can be a bad thing because it will encourage at least some artists to create artworks that have a negative impact on the society.",7.5,artists-need-a-certain-amount-of-freedom-to-develop-their-creativity-band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample
986,"Of all public transportation options, a metro is the most convenient way to get around a large city. Do you agree or disagree?","Cities are home to a large number of people and hence it is crucial to build a convenient mode of transportation in cities. Some people argue that of the options in public-transport, a metro is the easiest way to reach various places in the same city. I strongly agree with this view and in this essay I will support my stand with valid arguments.
To start with, metro fares are considerably low in large cities. This is because the main intention of the public transport department is to serve the public, irrespective of their financial status. For example, in major cities like Seattle, New York and Los Angles, the average metro fare is approximately $2.75. Consequently, even weaker sections of the society can access them.
By contrast, it is expensive to travel by other means of transportation like taxies or private buses. That explains why more and more people use the metro now. Moreover, metros are frequently available to all major destinations with less waiting period. The reason for this is that due to the high population in many cities, the transportation department has doubled the number of metro trains to meet the demand. For example, according to a survey conducted by a reputed firm in London, the frequency of metro trains has increased over the last five years and now they run every 15 minutes. Consequently, many urban residents have ditched their private vehicles in favour of metro.
To conclude, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that the metro is the cheapest and most reliable mode of transportation is cities.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample
987,"A person’s worth nowadays seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions. Old fashioned values, such as honour, kindness and trust, no longer seem important. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Some people think that values such as honor and kindness have become unimportant and the only important thing is the amount of money a person has. I strongly disagree with this statement and I will explain the reasons below.
There is no doubt that respect towards richer people has increased in the last few decades, so, the more income you have, the more respected you will be. However, this does not mean that a rich person is more valued. For example, someone who has a lot of money and does not share his wealth is going to be seen as a selfish person. People neither like nor respect them. By contrast, rich people who serve the society through their charitable acts receive a lot of adulation and admiration. Take, for instance, the case of Bill Gates. He is one of the most respected persons in the whole world but that is not because he is the richest man. Rather what made him so respectable is his philanthropic work.
There are also lots of celebrities like actors and sports persons who work for charitable institutions. They use their fame and influence to gather support for the causes they believe in. They also attract a lot of respect. For instance, in Spain, my country, there is an actor couple who quit their profession to volunteer for a charity helping poor children. These actors are well recognized because of their kind acts and not because of their money.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that money will certainly increase a person’s social standing; however, old values such as kindness and generosity are still very much cherished and in order to win the true love and admiration of their fellow citizens rich people have to show kindness and generosity.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-a-persons-worth-nowadays-seems-to-be-judged-according-to-social-status-and-material-possessions
988,Some people think that the range of technology currently available is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people. Others think that it is causing the opposite effect. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"Some people argue that in the modern society, technological advancements are increasing the gap between the wealthy and the poor while others believe that technology is decreasing the gap between them. In my opinion, certain technologies are available to all people in the society and help reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. However, certain innovations are inaccessible to the poor because of their high cost.
Certain inventions and discoveries decreased the gap between people of different income levels. This is because they are accessible to all people due to their availability at cheaper rates. For example, the internet technology is available to almost all sections of the society. It is affordable to all people and certain places such as railway stations, bus stations and airport are WiFi hotspots where internet is freely available. Online shopping facilities, e-learning opportunities and social networking sites are available to both affluent and poor people in the society and they decrease the gap between the rich and the poor.
However, certain advancements in technology are not affordable for the poorer sections of the society. Modern medicine, for example, is expensive. Certain new drugs and diagnostic procedures are very costly. Certain affluent people who developed cancer took treatment with a special kind of protein which was very expensive but had fewer side effects compared to conventional chemotherapy. Rich people can access these treatments by spending only a small portion of their income and improve their health. Poor people, on the other hand, have to spend all of their money for conventional treatments and yet there is no guarantee that they condition will improve.
In conclusion, certain innovations in technology decrease the gap between the rich and the poor while certain developments make society more polarized. It is hoped that in the near future all technologies will be available to all people regardless of their economic status.",7.5,band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-think-that-the-range-of-technology-currently-available-is-increasing-the-gap-between-rich-people-and-poor-people
989,"Nowadays celebrities are more known for their glamour and wealth than for their achievement, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","With the advancements in information technology, there has been a paradigm shift in the way celebrities are seen/viewed. These days being a celebrity is more about glamour and wealth than about achievements. I fully agree with the argument that this sets a bad example for the adolescents. This position will be proven by analysing how celebrities have corrupted young minds.
To begin with, often times celebrities go to great extremes to gain popularity even if this path leads to dangers. Recently, a news story posted by a Russian Instagram model went viral because she held the photo shoot on top of some of the tallest buildings in Dubai. In these death defying pictures, the model was seen on the edge of the rooftops of these buildings. In an attempt to emulate this, a young Chinese girl fell to her death. Obviously, celebrities can have a really negative impact on young people.
In addition to this, many celebrities promote materialistic values that can lead youngsters astray. For example, many reality TV shows such as ‘Keeping up with the Kardashian’s try to give the impression that their way of life is what youngsters should aspire for. Such shows inspire many young girls to get obsessed with material possessions and put the relationships and family values on the back burner.Thus it is evident that the extravagant lifestyle of celebrities sets a negative example for young people.
In conclusion, after analysing the dangers of religiously following celebrities and the impact they can have on adolescents, I fully believe that these days celebrities are not the role models to look up to. It is hoped that parents and teachers can spread more awareness among youngsters.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-nowadays-celebrities-are-more-known-for-their-glamour-and-wealth-than-for-their-achievement-and-this-sets-a-bad-example-to-young-people
990,In order to solve traffic problems government should tax private cars owners heavily and use the money to improve public transport. What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a solution?,"One of the most pressing issues in every country is the traffic problem. In order to solve this problem, some people suggest that the government should impose heavy tax on private car owners and use that money to improve public transport. In my opinion, this option has advantages and disadvantages.
On the one hand, heavy tax on private vehicles will discourage most people from buying cars. This will also help in reducing pollution to a great extent, as there will be less emission of harmful gases. Also, the tax money collected from this measure can be used to improve public transport. For example, the government can use it to build better roads and well equipped bus stations and railway stations. This will also boost infrastructural development in the country.
However, any such decision to increase tax on private vehicles will put people at a disadvantage. Not everybody resides in areas where they have easy access to public transport. For instance, in most countries farmers own land far from the city. They need their own vehicle to get to the nearest bus station or train station.
Another issue is that if people stop buying cars to avoid taxes it will have an adverse impact on car manufacturers. This will lead to an acute drop in sales and profit and employees will not be paid appropriately. Eventually, this will cause unemployment and hamper the economic growth of the country in the long run.
In conclusion, the decision to impose tax on private vehicles has merits and demerits. It might reduce pollution but at the same time it will cause a great deal of inconvenience to people. Before implementing this decision, the government should consider all the possible consequences.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-in-order-to-solve-traffic-problems-government-should-tax-private-cars-owners-heavily-and-use-the-money-to-improve-public-transport
991,Solar energy is becoming more and more popular as a source of household energy in many countries around the world. Why is this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy?,"Energy is a powerful commodity that controls the functioning of the entire world. Solar energy obtained from the light rays of our Sun has seen a recent rise in its popularity, especially as a source of energy in many households across the globe.
There is a possible explanation to this situation. Energy production from non-renewable sources like coal and petrol will be difficult / will be less viable in the near future not only because of the reduction in their reserve but also due to the high costs quoted by the countries which hold their reserves. Therefore the entire globe has become busy in developing renewable sources of energy. Since sunlight is available in abundance, solar energy has become a better alternative to other forms of energy.
Solar energy has its pros and cons, but the pros outweigh its cons. An advantage of solar energy is that it can be harnessed without having to build expensive power plants. Families can install solar panels on their roofs and generate adequate amount of energy to run household appliances such as lights, fans, heaters, refrigerators and so on. It is very simple and just needs the Sun out there in the sky. It is also clean and does not pollute the land or the air.
On the other hand, solar energy grids come with their own price which is unaffordable to the underdeveloped and developing countries around the Equator. These are the countries which benefit most from the solar energy owing to their geographical location. In the developed western world the situation is quite the opposite. These countries are cold and receive only a small amount of sunlight. Consequently, not much solar energy can be generated there. Despite these short comings, Germany has emerged as the world leader in solar energy production according to a recent report issued by WHO. Germans have well understood the proverb “Make hay while the Sun shines”. It is now time for the entire world to follow suit.
To conclude, solar energy is gaining popularity because it is safe and clean. In the coming years as the technology develops and solar panels become more affordable, its popularity will only increase.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-solar-energy-is-becoming-more-and-more-popular-as-a-source-of-household-energy-in-many-countries-around-the-world
992,"Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","University education system is one of the most widely discussed topics these days. Many people believe that college students should be allowed to choose subjects they like to study. Others think that it is always better to learn subjects that have relevance in the future and I agree with them. Both views will be discussed in this essay.
On the one hand, there are people who claim that college students should be given the privilege of choosing the subjects of study. Usually, the subjects for a particular course are decided by the university. According to these people, doing these courses is not effective and this has to change. If students get the opportunity to choose their subjects, learning will become more interesting for them. In addition, there are students who have talents in many other fields. Therefore, this proposed change in the education system will allow them to enhance their knowledge in a wide variety of subjects and polish their talents. For instance, if we include some arts and cultural subjects in engineering courses, this would pave the way for them to explore other fields. Nevertheless, this will affect the focus and ruin the quality of education.
On the other hand, some people believe that education should be based on the major subjects of the particular course rather than student’s interest. In their view, when students complete their course, they should have a thorough knowledge of that area. This is only possible if they study the subjects specific to the stream. Moreover, when we consider the future, competition for jobs will be very high and industries will hire only the finest talents. For example, a lot of innovations are happening. New subject topics and research fields have started to come up resulting in the betterment of technologies. Since the employment opportunities will be based on this technological knowledge, it is therefore, highly important that university students should focus more on studying these subjects for their better future.
To conclude, many people are against studying only core subjects; however, it is always better to study these subjects and make their fundamentals strong for a successful future.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-think-that-all-university-students-should-study-whatever-they-like
993,Most people agree that money cannot be happiness. Why is happiness difficult to define? How can people achieve happiness?,"Most people believe that there is no direct relation between money and happiness. There are various factors other than money that can make people happy. Happiness is a feeling that depends upon the needs of an individual and this makes it difficult to define. There are plenty of ways through which people can achieve happiness.
Happiness is a subjective feeling, which makes it difficult to define. In other words, happiness depends entirely on an individual and his or her needs at any point of time. Different people might have different needs; hence factors which make people happy vary from person to person. Generally speaking, people tend to feel happy when their needs are satisfied / fulfilled.
Furthermore, as the needs of people change over the years, the factors influencing their happiness also change, making it more difficult to define happiness. For instance, a chocolate can make a child happy; however, it does not mean much for an adult. Money might be a source of happiness for an adult but it is of little value for a child.
There can be different factors which makes people feel happy. One of the factors that might lead to happiness is job satisfaction. If people are satisfied with the kind of job they are doing, they tend to feel happy. Another factor leading to happiness is a loving family and friends. If the people in an individual’s life are loving and caring, they tend to be happy. Finally, doing social work can also lead to happiness. In other words, people feel happy when they serve the society and contribute towards making it a better place to live in. For instance, a doctor might find happiness in treating people for free.
In conclusion, there are several factors that can contribute towards happiness of different individuals. However, specific factors which make individuals happy are those which satisfy their needs at that point of time.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-most-people-agree-that-money-cannot-be-happiness-why-is-happiness-difficult-to-define-how-can-people-achieve-happiness
994,Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attraction. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Tourism is a flourishing industry. People who love to travel go over vast distances to see and appreciate foreign cultures and historical monuments. Some people are of the view that tourists from other countries should be charged more than the local natives for their visits. I, however, do not agree with this opinion.
Local visitors who have grown up and lived their lives surrounded by the cultural values and historic places do not have much appreciation for them. They do not give a lot of importance to this rich heritage and take it for granted. So, there is no reason to give them access at nominal prices.
By contrast, many foreign tourists have a real interest and admiration for other cultures and it is unfair to ask them to pay more for access to historical places. They travel thousands of miles and spend a lot of money to visit foreign countries. If these foreigners were to pay more than the locals, it would only discourage them from making a visit. Therefore, in my opinion, governments should charge the same fee from both international tourists and local visitors.
By doing so, authorities can encourage the international tourists to pay more visits, which will lead to the further development of the tourism industry. This will also make the local visitors realise and appreciate the importance of their cultural heritage. When people from across the globe can spend loads of money to see and admire their heritage, locals have no reason not to pay a visit.
In conclusion, I believe that the foreign tourists should pay the same, if not less, than the locals. When natives see foreigners flocking to their historical attractions, they will also be encouraged to do so.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-foreign-visitors-should-pay-more-than-local-visitors-for-cultural-and-historical-attraction-to-what-extent-do-you-agree-or-disagree-with-this-opinion
995,Traditional Reading is better than the digital reading. Do you agree or disagree?,"Physical books / hard copies of books are considered better than soft copies like eBooks. Although reading books on-line is widely practised and has gained much popularity over the past few decades, I believe that traditional reading will always be a better option. There are many advantages to it and this essay will attempt to outline a few of them.
To start with, reading on a digital device incessantly can have an adverse impact on our health especially on our eyes. The continuous glare on the monitor or screen causes eye problems. This is one of the most common issues faced by today’s generation. On the other hand, reading a physical book does not cause much harm to our eyes as it does not expose us to any radiations.
In addition, traveling with a book is always convenient and handy too. By contrast, carrying a laptop or eBook reader can be inconvenient and may cause discomfort at times. Moreover, these electronic devices are dependent on access to the electricity and internet connectivity, whereas physical books can be read any time. Also for some people/individuals, possessing a very famous or rare book is a matter of prestige. An electronic reading device or eBook can never offer that satisfaction. Also, it is not possible to digitalize all kinds of books, especially the ancient manuscripts. Besides, it is quite difficult to find e-books in local languages. Also, it is not possible to convert books written in rare languages into a digitized form.
In conclusion, we can say that reading books in the traditional way is a better choice than reading e-books as it is does not pose any threats to our eyes and is available in local languages and can easily be carried anywhere.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-traditional-reading-is-better-than-the-digital-reading-do-you-agree-or-disagree
996,"In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of labour. Some people regard this completely wrong while others consider it valuable and important for learning and enabling them to be responsible. What are your opinions on this? Do you agree or disagree?","Today in several countries we can see children as paid workers. While some individuals believe child labour should not be allowed, a few others encourage it considering it to be beneficial for a child’s development. However, in my opinion, children should not be allowed to work as it deprives them of their childhood.
It is a fact that childhood is the most memorable phase of a person’s life. It is at this age that we enjoy leading the most care-free life playing and enjoying around unaware of the struggles of life. Children at this age should focus on learning and should have the opportunities to explore their areas of interest. Instead if children are forced to work they will never be able to identify their real capabilities and will end up doing the same job to which they are exposed.
Another important fact is that most of the child labourers are usually exploited at their work places and are often mistreated by the employers. This is a major and serious concern as it adversely affects a child’s mind. Having bad experiences at a young age, sometimes develop a negative mindset in children and they are driven towards criminal activities. Hence, it is very crucial that children should have proper upbringing in a protective environment. Also, I believe that nations where child labour is widely practiced should adopt strict policies to have a restriction on the age limit.
In conclusion, the practice of employing children as paid workers should not be encouraged in any country as it would prevent them from leading a healthy and safe childhood.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-in-many-countries-children-are-engaged-in-some-kind-of-labour-some-people-regard-this-completely-wrong-while-others-consider-it-valuable-and-important-for-learning-and

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued that social networking sites especially Facebook are influencing people as well as societies in a negative way. I completely disagree with this statement because it social networks help people to solve many socio-economical problems.
There are many reasons I believe that social media plays an important role in an individuals’ life. Firstly, it makes human relationships stronger. To be clear, social networking sites bring people from different parts of the world together. These sites have even helped many people to find their lost families. In addition, social networking sites allow people who have common interests to form groups.
For example, Facebook has several community groups created by people with extra ordinary skills in art, music, dance or cookery. Those who are interested in these activities can join these groups and learn new skills. Moreover, it gives relaxation to those who do not have time to meet or communicate with anyone outside.
Another important advantage of social networking sites is they help people to act against social issues. To explain it further, users often upload photos of missing persons and other social problems.  For instance, recently, photos of missing kids were posted on the Facebook by their family member. Due to the large influx of likes and shares, the picture became quite famous and authorities had to take quick measures to resolve the case. As a result the culprit was captured and penalised under law.
In conclusion, social networking sites have some drawbacks but if they are used properly they have more merits than demerits.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-many-people-believe-that-social-networking-sites-such-as-facebook-have-had-a-negative-impact-on-both-individuals-and-society-to-what-extent-do-you-agree-or-disagree
998,"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Some people think that many renowned personalities are popular because of their riches and extravagant lifestyle, rather than their achievements, and this influences the youth in a negative way. I agree with this view to a certain extent.
Young adults are very ambitious and they look up to the famous people for inspiration and setting their own life goals. Popularity is a natural attraction for everyone. But looking up to celebrities, who are known only because of their wealth and posh lifestyle, is not a good thing. Glamour and money are ephemeral. Youngsters should be taught that money and glamour can come and go whereas the rewards that come with hard work and struggle stay for life. Celebrities should be famous for the hardships they faced for their achievements. Their journey to fame along with all the trials and tribulations should be highlighted and put in front of the young. Youngsters should be made aware of the fact that to achieve fame and make a name for themselves, these celebrated people faced a lot of tough times. For example, Steven Hawkins, the world famous physicist, lived almost whole of his life in a wheelchair, but his contribution to science can never be forgotten. Just money and glamour do not make a person famous.
Focusing just on the money and the glorious lifestyle surely sets a bad example to the youth and sets their expectations wrong. The young get inspired to be like these popular people and do not pay much attention to how to be like them. They ignore the struggle that is necessary to get to this status. This way they do not realise that the rewards have to be earned. Naturally, many of these youngsters end up not acquiring these riches for themselves, which leads to a feeling of frustration and depression amongst them.
To conclude, I am of the view that people should be popular for their struggle and success rather than their money and glorious lifestyle, as it inspires the youth and sets their expectations right. It makes them realize the importance of the hard work, which is required to gain the prize of fame.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-celebrities-are-more-famous-for-their-money-and-glamour
999,Being a celebrity such as a famous film star or sports personality brings problems as well as benefits. Do you think that being a celebrity brings more benefits or more problems?,"Some people believe that the advantages of being a celebrity outweigh the disadvantages. I completely agree with this statement because the benefits that come with being a celebrity are numerous; however there are also some drawbacks. Both advantages and disadvantages will be discussed in this essay.
To start with, the main disadvantage of being a celebrity is that they are constantly in the public eye and hence they cannot enjoy the sort of privacy that an ordinary person enjoys. Celebrities are easily recognized by their fans, critics and the media. Consequently, they have to be careful / cautious especially when they are in public places.
Recently, it has been observed that the media take advantage of the popularity of celebrities. For example, newspapers, magazines and television channels enhance their readership or viewership by publishing stories related to the personal life of celebrities. Some even go to the extent of fabricating catchy, defamatory and false stories about celebrities to promote the sales of their works.  To be honest, this is unfair to the celebrities.
However, despite the drawbacks, the benefits of being a celebrity are many. The feeling that comes with the fame, and the knowledge that people recognize and appreciate you for the work you do is awesome and great. In addition, Celebrities are being hired / signed for endorsing products and services. They are known to have a large fan base and hence they are employed as ambassadors by politicians during election campaigns to win votes. They are well rewarded in cash or kind.
In conclusion, after analysing both aspects of the situation it is not hard to see that there are more benefits than disadvantages to being a celebrity. The main problem that celebrities face is the intrusion into their privacy.

1000,"One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing.
Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","It is true that average life expectancy has increased significantly because of the advances made in the field of medical science. In my opinion, this is generally a positive development; however, it also means that more resources are required for taking care of the elderly.
Longer life expectancy does not necessarily mean that a person will remain healthy throughout their life. Older people need medical and nursing care more frequently and they have more number of sick days per year. This means societies need more doctors, nursing staff, healthcare facilities and home care facilities to care for their ageing population. In addition, with the increase in the number of retired people the government spending on pension schemes and other welfare services will also increase exponentially. Furthermore, more retired people also means lower tax revenue. All these issues will ultimately put a tremendous burden on the working young population.
However, increasing life expectancy also has many advantages to the individual, their family and the government. Firstly, the obvious benefit of this is that people can live longer with their family and travel to various places. They can enjoy life longer and contribute more to the society. Secondly, families can also get benefit from their wisdom and experience. They can give valuable advice and emotional support to younger generation in difficult times. They also take care of their grandchildren and teach them various life skills, moral and cultural values. Finally, the government can also benefit from the elderly. They can make elderly people more productive either by increasing the age of retirement or by availing their services in non labour intensive managerial community work.

1001,"In some schools and universities, girls choose arts subjects (literature), and boys tend to choose science subjects (physics). Why do you think this is so? Should this tendency be changed?","There is a common trend among female students to prefer art subjects and male students to prefer science subjects at university. This tendency results from the existence of gender based stereotypes. For example, when we hear the word doctor or engineer we automatically think of a man. However, it needs to be changed. In this essay, I will deal with this common practice in detail and explain why it should be changed.
For a long time, people have believed that the female brain is evolved to be suitable for art subjects while the male brain is suitable for science subjects. Consequently, parents encourage their sons to choose streams like medicine or engineering and daughters to choose literature or music. However, there is no scientific background to support this belief. It means that this is a stereotype and myth. As we can see, lots of men have gained name and recognition as artists, musicians and authors. Likewise, lots of women have become successful architects, scientists and engineers.
For this reason, this myth needs to be busted because it is preventing / discouraging some women who are very talented in science from contributing to science. It is quite disadvantageous to the persons concerned and also to their country.
In conclusion, there is no scientific reason for their belief. Thus, it should change so that the talented students are able to contribute to the field that they are good at and earn success and prosperity for themselves and their nations.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-girls-choose-arts-and-boys-choose-science-at-university
1002,Car ownership has increased so rapidly over the past 30 years that many cities in the world are now ‘one big traffic jam’. How true do you think this statement is? What measures can governments take to discourage people from using their cars?,"It is true that the number of people having a car has increased exponentially in the last  thirty years. While I completely agree with the view / opinion / argument that most metro cities have become ‘one big traffic jam’, there are many steps which governments can take to tackle this problem.
Traffic congestion is the most pressing issue that many cities across the world face today. Over the last few decades, the rate of car ownership has accelerated significantly, and if not controlled, it is likely to rise further. Admittedly, governments across the world have tried to resolve / fix this problem by widening existing roads; however, they have not been able to match the pace of increasing car ownership. Consequently, the problem of congestion has escalated to such a level that in big cities, it affects not only business activities but also the physical and mental well-being of residents. Businesses incur loss because of the delay in moving their goods and manpower. Urban residents also suffer because of the constant noise and air pollution caused by frequent traffic jams.
There are many measures that governments can initiate to contain this issue of increasing number of cars on roads. First of all, governments can increase the financial burden of owing a car by imposing green tax on the sale of new cars and fuel. They are likely to face resistance from voters; however, they can certainly gather public support by running awareness campaigns. Moreover, they can invest more in public transport. If people find that travelling by bus or commuter train can save their money and time, they will certainly prefer them to private vehicles.
In conclusion, although most cities struggle with the issue of traffic congestion, authorities can alleviate this situation / problem by imposing carbon tax on private vehicles and improving public transport infrastructure.",7.5,band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample-increasing-car-ownership-has-made-many-cities-one-big-traffic-jam
1003,With a fast pace of modern life more and more people are turning towards fast food for their main meals. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Replacing daily meals with fast foods is becoming a norm in the modern world. People in the modern society are no longer cooking due to their busy schedules. In my opinion, this trend has more demerits than merits.
To begin with, fast foods are made up of a high proportion of unhealthy ingredients such as unsaturated fats, oil and sugar. Frequent intake of these will cause obesity and health problems including diabetes and high cholesterol levels. In additional to that, fast foods have very low nutritional value and do not fulfill the requirements of a balanced diet. Hence, constant intake of fast foods may cause nutritional deficiency in the long term. This is especially harmful to children and teenagers whose bodies are still developing.
Besides that, replacing proper meals with fast foods may also affect family bonding over dinner. Packaged fast foods are almost never eaten together sitting around a table. Rather youngsters and children alike consume them mindlessly sitting in front of the television or computer. The overuse of fast foods also eliminates any opportunity to cook together and talk. This lack of communication within the household affects family ties. Children may suspect that they are not close enough to their parents and stop sharing the issues they face at school. This may eventually cause behavioural problems in them.
To conclude, I feel that the invention of fast foods is bringing more harms than good to the modern society. In my opinion, health and family bonding time are precious things and they should be the priorities of our lives at all times.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-fast-food-is-replacing-regular-meals
1004,Children should spend their free time doing school work. Do you agree or disagree? How do you think children should spend their free time?,"Some people opine that children are given a lot of free time and that they should utilize it doing more school work. However I feel doing more school work in their free time will make them dull and frustrated unless it is some sort of extra -curricular activities conducted by the school.
There is a lot of pressure exerted on kids these days and if they start doing school work in their free time, it will curb their talents. Free time should be used for playing and experimenting with new things. Free time is something which helps students realize their potential. If Newton hadn’t had the time to think why the apple had fallen to the ground, he wouldn’t / couldn’t have discovered the law of gravity. So instead of using all their free time for studies, children should engage in other activities that hone their creative or social skills.
Many schools these days have certain groups for extra-curricular activities like football groups, project groups and even cultural societies. Children must take part in these groups actively in their free time as it would enhance their overall development. Working in these groups will help students learn how to manage their time and also teach them how to work in a team .These groups also organize many events which help students learn life skills like financial management which are not really covered in the syllabus.
In conclusion, I think children should utilize their free time by taking part in extra-curricular activities rather than doing the monotonous school works. Free time is a blessing and parents and teachers should help children utilize it to their advantage.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-children-should-spend-their-free-time-doing-school-work
1005,"Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Many people argue that undergraduates should have the freedom to choose their desired subjects, while others argue that they should be allowed to study only science subjects which will be highly in demand in the future. While there are strong arguments both in favour of and against the given propositions, in my opinion, students should have the freedom to choose subjects of their interest.
Each individual has a set of skills and talents that are unique to them. That means not everyone can become doctors or engineers. They don’t have to either because the world needs writers, masons, painters and artists as well. So the education system should allow them to pursue what they are good at or follow their passion/talent.
For instance, a recent study found that students who study subjects of their choice are likely to enjoy a stable family life and better mental health than those who are forced to learn science. Therefore, the argument that students should be permitted to study their favourite subjects certainly make sense.
On the other hand, an increasing number of parents believe that science and technology are the only subjects with potential for success in the future. With that misconception in mind they naturally manipulate and brainwash their children to follow such subjects thinking that it is the only way to achieve success in the future. Such persuasive actions not only violate the human rights of students but also waste their real talent. For example, if someone has an extraordinary talent for singing and dancing, they have to pursue it. Otherwise they will become unsatisfied in their career or fail in their studies.
In conclusion, while there are arguments for and against giving students the freedom to choose their subjects, in my opinion, they should be allowed to decide who they want to be.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-students-should-only-be-allowed-to-study-science-subjects
1006,Some people say that parents should encourage their children to take part in organised group activities in their free time. Others say that it is important for children to learn how to occupy themselves on their own. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Many people believe that young children should be encouraged and motivated to participate more in various group activities during their leisure time, while others feel that children should be left on their own in order for them to understand how to spend their free time. In my opinion, children should be encouraged to do group activities.
It is often believed that true team sprit can be achieved through group activities only. Children participating in these activities tend to be more sharing and caring. They learn to value others’ feelings right from their childhood and also learn how to interact with different types of people. Working and playing in a team inculcates many good habits in them, which are beneficial for them in their future.
Conversely, children growing up on their own, without any pressure from the parents get the freedom to think and attain a sense of individuality, which further helps them in the development of their personality. It’s generally seen that kids brought up in this kind of environment become more creative and independent.
To conclude, in my opinion, up to a certain stage in the childhood, children should be motivated to do group activities to learn values like team spirit and cooperation, but after some time, kids should be left on their own, in order for them to understand who they truly are and what their expectations and desires are. Furthermore, parents should always keep a proper check on their children and see whether they are following the right path.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-group-activities-vs-individual-activities-for-children
1007,"Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Some people argue that universities should only offer courses related to science and technology as these subjects will be helpful in the coming years, while others opine that students should be allowed to study the subjects of their own choice. Although students will definitely enjoy designing their own curriculum, in my opinion, allowing them to decide what they should study is not a wise idea because they may end up choosing subjects that have no demand in the job market.
It is true that allowing students to choose their subjects will make learning more interesting for them. It may also discourage them from dropping out; however, this strategy may produce graduates and post graduates with no job skills. Students are too young to understand the requirements of the job market. If they have an opportunity to choose their subjects, they are more likely to choose those subjects they are interested in. For example, many students find arts, literature and history interesting. While it is true that these subjects are also worth learning, they create much fewer jobs than subjects like science and technology. Consequently, this will increase the unemployment rate in the country.
Education is much more than an opportunity to acquire knowledge. Ideally, education should equip students with the skills required to earn a livelihood. Since science and technology produces more jobs than any other sector or subject, in my opinion, universities should definitely give preference to those subjects. This, however, does not mean that other subjects like arts or literature should not be offered at all. That strategy is also unlikely to produce the desired results because the world needs musicians, painters and writers as much as it needs doctors and engineers.
To conclude, universities should certainly give more importance to subjects like science and technology. However, they should also offer other subjects to students who have a genuine interest in them.",7.5,band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample-universities-should-only-teach-science-and-technology
1008,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decided to do it.,"In many countries some students take a year off after finishing their high school studies for travelling or working before they enroll in a university. In my perspective, this one year gap in between high school and university provides them more disadvantages than advantages.
On the one hand, there are some merits for students who take a year off to travel or work between high school and university. Firstly, travel broadens the mind of your people. This might help them to gain valuable experience in their life. For example, students who travel to different places get a chance to mingle with different types of people and cultures and this may improve their knowledge and experience. Another positive outcome is that while traveling or working, young people could acquire maturity and this would help them perform well when they join the university. A final benefit is that young people will probably earn some money when they work before joining the university. This money can be used to pay their university fees.
On the other hand, there are more drawbacks when students spend a year working or travelling before joking the university. The first one is that if young people decide to work, they might get used to receiving an income and because of this they will not want to come back to their student life anymore. The second one is that travelling is a expensive activity and students who travel a year requires a huge amount of money. This could be spent on university studies. What is more, most of the students are too young to travel by themselves and this might put them in more dangerous situations. For example, young students are not mature enough and they may get involved in illegal activities such as selling drugs and crime.
In conclusion, although there are some advantages to travelling or working between high school and university, in my opinion, the disadvantages of this practice outweigh the advantages.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-taking-a-year-off-between-high-school-and-university
1009,"In many developing countries, there is a problem with declining quality of air and water from both industry and construction. What measures could be taken to prevent this?","Air and water are indispensable for the very existence of life. As these resources are polluted by various types of industries and construction, it severely affects the people and the environment. Therefore, preventive measures should be taken to stop / arrest further contamination of air and water.
One of the reasons for water pollution is the expulsion of / the dumping of enormous amount of industrial waste into rivers and lakes. Air is contaminated by fumes from factories. In order to prevent these issues, it is important to invent an innovative method to treat trash/rubbish. Respective authorities should launch new projects which focus mainly on the purification process of natural resources and the protection of environment. For example, Israel has recently developed an impeccable system which purifies sea water and it has been presented to Indian government. In other words, people should think about how they can keep air and water pure, instead of polluting those resources and causing detrimental effects on health.
Furthermore, stringent guidelines should be provided to the factories to deter them from polluting. The government should take punitive actions against the organisations which indulge in water and air contamination. For instance, those industries which cause harm to these essential resources should have their licence cancelled / revoked. This, in turn, will help to prevent / stop other people from involving in similar activity. In short, each industry should rationally think about how their business is negatively affecting the environment and carry out their functions adhering to the government rules.
To conclude, modern technologies and strict functioning rules are necessary to prevent the declining quality of air and water. If industries and construction take / adopt / adheres to such precautionary measures, people will definitely have healthier surroundings.

1010,"Some people think that the teenage years are the happiest times of most people’s lives. Others think that adult life brings more happiness, in spite of greater responsibilities. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","People have different opinions about happiness and the happiest times in their life. While many people believe they were very happy during their adolescence, others opine that adulthood was more enjoyable than their teenage years. In my opinion, the happiest times of life may vary from person to person.
Each stage of life has its joys and sorrows. Many people remember their teenage years with utmost importance. There are several reasons for this. Most people would have enjoyed a great sense of freedom during their college days or school days. As friendship and brotherhood are in their prime during those years, many would have experienced joyful moments. For example, college parties and sports events were great occasions to get together and have great fun. Also, teenagers have much fewer responsibilities than adults.
On the other hand, adulthood offers several positive and happy moments. Most of the adults fondly remember their cherished moments such as their first house or job, marriage day celebration, birth of their child and so on. As people age, they also evolve and develop qualities such as maturity and understanding. These factors can bring a sense of fulfillment and stability which in turn contributes to long term happiness in many people’s lives.
In conclusion, adulthood and teenage life have their share of ups and downs. While it is the lack of responsibilities that make life joyous during adolescence, it is the realization of one’s dreams and aspirations that make adult life more memorable.

1011,Many people believe that formal “pen and paper” examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. Discuss this view and give your own opinion.,"Here is another essay on the same topic:
Traditional paper based tests are no longer considered as the most suitable / effective way to evaluate academic performance or grades. I agree with the argument that writing based tests are able to assess what students learn in a year. This essay will discuss why it is not possible to evaluate a student’s creativity and other aspects of achievement using written examinations.
The formal test does not evaluate all aspects of learning such as speaking and communication skill. In school, many teachers give students lectures about how to effectively express their thoughts verbally because this is a crucial skill in real world. In 2014, the Korean Times reported that the score which students got in writing exams is irrelevant to promotion.
The traditional exam is also unable to test how creative the examinees are because of its nature of format. As writing tests focus on question and answer form, it is really rare that an examinee answers beyond what the examiner expects. In August 2016, the Korean Educational Association released a research paper which claimed that the nations whose test format is not formal has 10% higher mark in the Creative Index than the nations whose tests are traditional.
In conclusion, written exams are not the most superior way of evaluating what was learned during the course because these types of tests do not evaluate other aspects or learning or creativity that is out of boundary of the tests. It is recommended that other formats of exams are also included in the evaluation process.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-the-formal-pen-and-paper-tests-are-not-very-effective
1012,Some people think that the effective way to reduce industrial pollution is to tax the companies which cause them. Others think that there are better ways to do so. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Some people think that imposing more tax on companies which contribute to the increase in the pollution will force them to reduce their negative footprints on the environment. Other people believe that there are more viable methods to encourage companies to decrease their pollution. In my opinion, there are many possible ways to motivate firms to reduce their negative / damaging impact on the environment instead of applying more taxes.
Admittedly, imposing additional taxes on companies that contribute to the industrial pollution might force them to reduce carbon emission or waste produced by their operations. They might consider ways to reduce their pollution; nevertheless, this will be limited to meeting certain standards stipulated / imposed by the authorities.
On the other hand, people usually act more positively towards incentives and rewards. In other words, if governments grant more incentives to companies that reduce pollution, then these companies will strive to take serious steps to decrease their negative impact and gain rewards .Authorities can motivate companies by many ways. First, certain tax reduction scheme can be granted to firms that decrease their pollution to below the industrial standard. For example, the corporate income tax in Turkey is around 35%; however, if a company uses a certain technology to reduce its carbon footprints, then this company will be eligible for tax reduction. Second, the government should consider granting loans at a discounted rate to companies that reduce toxins produced by their operations. This approach has proven its success in many counties like Japan and Taiwan. Another motivation for companies to reduce their pollution is to encourage them to benefit from their waste. For instance, in Turkey, firms that invest in technology to convert waste to energy are compensated by the authority as all the electricity produced from waste will be bought by the government at a high price.
In conclusion, I believe penalties might force companies to meet the minimum pollution standard; however, granting incentives and rewards schemes will encourage companies to be more innovative and reduce their industrial pollution to limits less than the set standards.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-the-effective-way-to-reduce-industrial-pollution-is-to-tax-the-companies-that-cause-them
1013,Today more people are travelling than ever before. Why is this the case? What are the benefits of travelling for the traveller?,"In recent years, there has been a continuous surge in the number of individuals who travel around the world. There are many reasons for the increase in travelling. These include the expansion of businesses, desire to pursue higher education and the need for a better quality of life. In any case, travelling always has a positive impact on travellers.
Many large organisations have expanded their business to new markets and become multinational firms such as Exxon Mobile, Nike and British Petroleum. When one of these organisations establishes operations in a new country, it transfers its employees to this country. Another reason for the rise in people travelling is that more individuals especially from Asian and Middle East countries seek higher level of education in developed countries like Canada, the USA and the UK. Nowadays, there are thousands of international students travelling to the US or the UK to purse a Masters’ or Ph.D programme.
Moreover, many people immigrate around the world to find new job opportunity. For example, many teachers travel from the USA, and the UK to teach in Asia and Middle East where they get better income. At the same time, a considerable number of individuals immigrate from developing countries to the developed ones to look for better quality of life.
On the other hand, there are many advantages that travellers might gain. Firstly, individuals who travel tend to develop skills that help them with their professional and personal life. For instance, people become more self-confident as they are more independent when they travel to a new country. Moreover, travellers are exposed to new experiments which increase their creativity. Secondly international students who gain a Master or Ph.D. degree have better chance to find a lucrative job in their country. Last but not least, skilled immigrants who travel to developed countries have considerable opportunities to provide their families with better education and quality of life than that is available in their own country.
In conclusion, travelling has increased dramatically due to the expansion of multinational firms and the increase in number of people who seek better opportunities.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-more-people-are-traveling-than-before
1014,"Even though organic fruits and vegetables are more expensive than conventional fruits and vegetables, they are worth the extra money. Do you agree or disagree?","People are debating whether organic fruits and vegetables are worth the premium they command. People are usually reluctant to spend more money on organic foods; however, in my opinion, they are good for health and I don’t mind spending some extra money on them.
Traditionally, we had been buying non-organic fruits and vegetables, until organic counterparts became available. With growing population, producing food has been challenging without using fertilizers or some sort of food steroids, but this has lead to degradation in quality and there are some serious health problems associated with it namely asthma, heart problems etc. Most fruits and vegetables are grown using GM (Genetically Modified) seeds, which are monopolized by big industry players such as Monsanto, DuPont etc. and farmers are forced to use these seeds in order for them to survive and pay off humongous loans. In developing countries, this has become a major problem for the entire population since the quality is far worse than it used to be. On the bright side, this has made people aware of the importance of consuming organic fruits and vegetables.
Organic products used to be very expensive a few years back, but with growing popularity and demand the prices have come down. Organic fruits and vegetables contain no harmful chemicals, fertilizers, seeds etc. and this has been proven by the scientific studies in many countries. The same studies have also proven the health benefits of organic produce. In my opinion, people should think of organic produce as a good investment in their health, and should not hesitate to spare some more.
In conclusion, I think organic fruits and vegetables are better than their non-organic counterparts and one hundred percent worth the extra money.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-are-organic-fruits-and-vegetables-worth-the-extra-money
1015,Many museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?,"Museums are places of cultural beauty and historical interest for many people. Some museums are open to public for free of charges. On the other hand, many museums set a fixed entrance fee. In my opinion, the benefits of charging entrance fee at museums outnumber the limitations. The following paragraphs analyze the advantages of collecting fees at museums.
Firstly, entrance fees increase the income of museums. These centers do not have any other forms of revenue. That means, the respective governments have to look after all the financial matters of these types of organizations. The revenue generated at museums could be used for paying employees’ salary and renovating the damaged areas of the museum. Thus it increases the financial capacity of museums. Hill palace at Cochin is a perfect example of this type of museums.
Secondly, charging an entry fee could normally restrict the entry of people who are not interested in history and culture. For instance, if admissions are free of cost people like lovers, beggars and rogues may enter and hinder the seriousness of the place. Moreover, it can lead to congestion in the public museums and actual visitors may stay away from visiting the museums. Hence, admission fees at museums play an important role in restricting people from using museums for personal purposes and providing hassle free entry and visit for the real art lovers.
In conclusion, I believe that the merits of charging entry fees at museums are more than demerits because this increases the revenues of the arts center and stops people from using these institutions for their personal objectives.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-some-museums-charge-an-entry-fee
1016,"In a number of countries, some people think it is necessary to spend large sums of money on constructing railway lines for very fast trains between cities.  Others believe the money should be spent on improving existing public transport. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","Some people argue that governments should spend more money on developing bullet and metro rail facilities, while others support the idea of spending money on upgrading current public transport system. This essay analyses these viewpoints in the following paragraphs and concludes with my opinion.
To begin with, many people support the plan of investing in intercity rail networks because they save their valuable time. To explain it further, these types of trains run faster than any other public transportation facilities. They stop only at major stations and hence they are not delayed like passenger trains. This makes them a boon for super busy business professionals who cannot afford to be held up in traffic.
On the other hand, improving / upgrading the current government owned transportation methods could also solve the issue of possible traffic blocks in towns. That means if public transport is reliable more and more people will start using it to move around the cities for shopping and entertainment. If the government could properly maintain the present modes of transport, many people will stop using their own vehicles because public transportation is always cheap and affordable. This way, the traffic jams caused by private vehicles on the road can also be reduced to a great extent.
In conclusion, the government should invest in both fast trains and other existing modes of transport because they are both required to ease traffic congestion in the cities.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-spending-money-on-super-fast-trains-vs-spending-it-on-existing-public-transport
1017,Many people work from home using modern technology today. Some people think that only the workers benefit from this and not the employers. Do you agree or disagree?,"It goes without saying that work from home has proved to be beneficial for the workforce. Some people argue that only employees are benefited by this and not the employers. In my opinion, it is a win-win situation for both employees and employers. There are many reasons to support the argument / view that employers benefit when their workers work from home.
To begin with, a company has to spend a lot of money for the construction of buildings as well as for maintaining infrastructure. If a company allows its employees to work from home, they can save money. Moreover, the other expenses incurred by the employer  to provide basic facilities to employees such as electricity, meals, and sanitation are also saved. On top of it, employers prefer to have these kinds of employees as they agree to work on less salary. Therefore, employers are benefited by the latest technology of working online.
Online work has proved to a boon for employees as well.  They can save money and time as they do not have to commute daily. This reduces the traffic on the roads which is positive for the whole society. Furthermore, some female workers who cannot step out of their homes due to their responsibilities, also get a chance  to work and feel proud of themselves. Working from home is also beneficial for salaried people who want to earn some extra income from their home. For example, some people do “data entry jobs” available on websites of many companies.
In conclusion, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that working from home benefits both the employer and the employee. In my opinion, this is a positive trend and hence it should be promoted.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-some-people-believe-that-working-from-home-only-benefits-employees
1018,"Currently there is a trend towards the use of alternative forms of medicine. However at best, these methods are ineffective and at worst, they may be dangerous. To what extent you agree?","In the modern society, there is a trend of depending on alternative systems of medicine for the cure of many diseases. However, these forms of medicine can be detrimental to human health. However, there are people who believe that these forms of medicine can be detrimental to human health. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, alternative medicine is not harmful. It can cure a great deal of diseases.
The alternative forms of medicine such as Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and Naturopathy are increasingly gaining popularity. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, there are fewer side effects for these kinds of medicine. People are sometimes very reluctant to take allopathic medicines because of the harmful side effects. Ayurvedic and Homeopathic medicines are made of natural substances and thus have fewer side effects. Secondly, treatment options in traditional forms of medicine are less invasive and cheaper compared to the modern medicine. In the case of chronic illnesses, huge sums need to be spent for medical care in hospitals
A number of diseases can be cured effectively with traditional medicine. Ayurvedic massage is the best treatment for cervical spondylosis and spinal cord compression. Some traditional medicine practitioners have effective treatment for lifestyle diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Some Ayurvedic practioners claim to have cure for diseases such as cancer. The alternative systems of medicine are now a separate field of medicine and many researches are being carried out in this field. Through these researches, they are trying to discover new medicinal wonders in nature.
In conclusion, I believe that the ancient systems of medicine can cure many diseases. They are not harmful. They are beneficial for human beings as they have no side effects and are less invasive and cheap compared to allopathic medicines.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-are-alternative-medicines-harmful

To what extent you agree?,"Some people believe that when a person goes to a foreign country, they should follow practices and customs of that country. In my opinion, one should not try to follow foreign culture or one’s own culture blindly. Rather / instead one should adopt the best of both cultures.
When people stay in a foreign country, they should adapt to some of the customs and rituals of that country. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, it is not possible to live in a foreign country completely isolated from foreign people. Outsiders always require some kind of help and support from native people in order to live in a foreign country successfully. Secondly, natives feel happier when they see outsiders adopting some of the customs and practices of locals into their life. This enables foreigners to have a good career and pleasant life in another country. For example, native people feel happy when foreigners greet them according to their style.
On the other hand, it is important for outsiders to practice some of the customs and practices of their own country. It is not possible for them to completely forget their own culture. Celebrating certain festivals of their own country will provide them happiness and deep contentment. They can organise social gatherings with people of their own country. These kinds of activities help them to overcome homesickness and loneliness.
In conclusion, when people move to another country it is not necessary to completely follow practices of that country. Outsiders should adopt some aspects of the foreign culture and at the same time they should not forget the best of their culture.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-people-traveling-to-foreign-countries-should-adopt-foreign-culture
1020,"In many cities today, most people live in large apartment blocks. Does this kind of accommodation have more advantages or disadvantages?","Thanks to the modern amenities provided by large residential apartments many people prefer them to detached houses. In my opinion, the benefits of living in apartment blocks outweigh its drawbacks.
According to a recent survey apartments improve the living standard of its residents. This is because most of the flats are situated at the heart of the cities where people can have easy access to all the modern amenities. Obviously, these advanced facilities help people to broaden their social reach. Furthermore, apartments are close to schools, offices and hospitals and hence staying in them makes life more convenient for residents. They do not have to travel long distances to get to work or school. This saves both time and money for them.
Another important advantage of living in an apartment complex is that it provides a sense of security to the residents. Apartments are safer than stand alone homes in many aspects. First of all, entering this gated community is quite difficult for an outsider due to the presence of multiple gates. Apart from this, advanced security surveillance cameras are installed and security officers employed to monitor and check the activities of visitors. That prevents burglars and other offenders from entering apartments and makes residents safe. Perhaps the biggest downside of living in an apartment is the space constraints. Apartments are smaller but compared to the many advantages they offer, this is a negligible disadvantage.
In conclusion, although there are some disadvantages to living in multi-storey buildings, I think they provide more security and convenience. These are also reasons that encourage more and more people to choose them.

1021,Education is considered vital for the future of any society in today’s world. Governments throughout the world should make education compulsory for all children between the ages of 5-15 years. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement?,"Education provides the opportunity to live a prosperous life by securing a good job or establishing a business. Some people argue that governments all over the world should make education compulsory / mandatory for all children in the 5-15 age group. In my opinion it is a positive development because education is the best tool to get success.
The first reason to support the view that education should be compulsory is its power to eradicate poverty from the society. Millions of illiterate people living in developing countries are deprived of their basic rights such as food and shelter.  They are exploited at the workplace by their employers who pay them less for more work. Education will make them aware of their rights and enable them to earn more for their families. Even uneducated people living in developed countries are able to earn well and get respect because in those countries employers are required to pay at least the minimum hourly wages determined by the government. This is not the case in poor countries where illiterate people get neither money nor respect. Needless to say, they need education to get out of poverty and exploitation.
Another reason to support compulsory education is that it will reduce the crime rate in the society. Studies have shown that uneducated people are more likely to get into crime because they don’t have a stable source of income. It is, therefore, clear that if the people are educated, the crime rates will be low.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that education plays a crucial role in improving the living standards of both the individuals and the society and hence it should be made compulsory for all children.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-education-should-be-compulsory-for-all-children
1022,Happiness is considered very important in life. Why is it difficult to define? What factors are important in achieving happiness?,"A state of bliss is the most cherished moments of human life. A happy mind is considered the best indicator of a blissful state. Despite the fact that all of us have experienced happiness at one point or another, it is challenging to define it. This essay explores the reason behind this and the crucial factors contributing to the realization of happiness.
A cheerful state is often hard to describe. This is because it is a complex amalgam of various social, emotional, physical and mental factors. Also, a combination of these factors that makes one person happy need not necessarily produce the same result on another person. For example, some people are happy when they have a sumptuous dinner; others don’t associate happiness with a hearty meal or other luxuries of life.  This can be traced to their perception of the world, which in turn affects what makes them happy. Thus cheerful emotions are hard to be defined as they vary from individuals to individuals.
Many factors could lead to a feel-good sensation. Good health, wealth, social status and a happy family are some of the essential ingredients that make people happy. Having said that, there are exceptional cases where we can find people in a happy state, despite being in physical pain. For instance, the biggest joy in the world is when a mother hears her baby cry for the first time after birth. Despite the immense pain she is enduring, a sense of happiness fills her heart. These types of situations point to the state of bliss created by emotion outweighing the physical discomfort. Therefore, it is evident that overall welfare in all of the realms or over excitement in one of the realms can lead to a state of bliss.
In conclusion, a variety of factors contribute to the realization of happiness and if happiness is difficult to define, that is because people’s perception of it varies.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-why-is-it-difficult-to-define-happiness
1023,New parents should attend a parenting course to learn how to bring up their children well. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that, training for bringing up kids is necessary for those who are getting into the parenthood newly. I completely agree with this point of view and the reasons for my agreement are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Undergoing a parenthood training helps parents to know the importance of positively motivating and supporting their children at each stages of their growth and development. It is observed that, most of the parents are heavily busy with their professional targets. Hence, they get hardly short time to attend the needs of their offspring. Moreover, they are unaware of their parental responsibilities. To explain further, participating in a parenting course could rightly equip parents with suitable skills to support and motivate their beloved ones whenever they are in need of parent support and guidance. So that, each child in every family would not be abandoned without proper assistance from parents. This will result in an increased number of rightly motivated and supported children in the society.
Participating in parental training makes parents the role models of their children. For example, a child of conflicting parents would be always dissatisfied and stressful. If they join for parental training, it would help them to identify the weak areas of their parenting and gradually improve their mutual love and acceptance. Hence, their children also start learning the basics of love, respect and other personal qualities as well. Moreover, those children will be more satisfied and proud of their parents always.
In conclusion, I fully agree with the idea of new parent training because, it can aid parents to be the real supporters and models of their children.",7.5,band-6-5-ielts-essay-sample-new-parents-should-receive-training-in-parenting
1024,Some people believe that school students should only do homework every day. Other think children should get to do extra work to succeed at school. How far do you agree or disagree.,"The amount of homework that should be assigned to students has become a topic of intense debate nowadays. Although some people think that homework is vital and should be assigned each day, others opine differently. However, in my opinion, homework should only be assigned on a few days a week so that students can also spend quality time on other activities.
It is indeed true that doing homework regularly has several advantages. Primarily, it makes students disciplined and discipline is the key to success. Several successful persons have attributed their success to their habit of doing homework every day. Additionally, homework keeps students busy so there are fewer chances of them getting swayed into bad company. This also holds special significance in the age of nuclear families where children spend most of their daytime away from their parents.
Conversely, giving everyday homework to students can also have several detrimental effects on students. Firstly, homework can act as a hindrance to the holistic development of students. In other words, an excess of homework eats away a lion’s share of leisure time in students’ lives. Consequently, students get no time for doing physical activities or playing outdoor games. It can create repercussions with far reaching consequences.
Secondly, homework given everday is also responsible for making students’ lives extremely stressful. Modern curricula are already very challenging and mentally demanding and on the top of that excess homework creates a stressful environment. As per a survey published in The Hindu last month, 80% school going children in Chandigarh are suffering from various kinds of dementia, and homework has been the norm for Chandigarh schools for several years.
Finally, in my opinion, a student’s day-to-day activities should comprise of both physical and academic activities. This can be easily achieved by devoting a few days of the week to homework while other days to physical or sports activities. Such kind of balance is essential for the overall development of students.
To conclude, even though homework has a few benefits it must not act as an obstacle to the comprehensive growth of children. For their bright future, it is imperative that school going children must spend equal time in academic and outdoor activities.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-children-should-do-only-homework-every-day
1025,Many criminals commit further crime as soon as they are released from prison. What do you think are the causes for this? What possible solutions can you suggest?,"It is true that convicted criminals commit offences again upon their release. There are various reasons for this, but steps can definitely be taken to tackle the problem. In my opinion, there are three main factors which encourage criminals to commit crimes again.
Firstly, it is difficult for the ex-criminals to secure a job for living. Employers believe that criminals are not trust worthy to be recruited and reject their applications. Secondly, criminals are stigmatised by the society. Usually, people do not like to interact with criminals and not many landlords want to let their house to them. Finally, relatives and friends hurt and isolate ex-criminals by blaming them for everything wrong with their family.
On the bright side, there are several ways to reform criminals. I believe that governments have an important role to play here. They should introduce special workshops that teach various skills to prisoners / ex-offenders. Later these people should also be provided with some funds with which they can establish their own businesses. If these people can find employment, they are less likely to commit crimes again. Community leaders should also play an active role in breaking the barriers between the criminals and the society. They should give criminals an opportunity to have meaningful interactions with other members of the society. At the same time, loved ones should understand the mental turbulence of ex-prisoners and give them the support and confidence.
In conclusion, criminals will continue to reoffend unless the government, the society and families trust and help them to reclaim their lives.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-many-criminals-commit-further-crimes-as-soon-as-they-are-released
1026,"Some people think that when recruiting, companies should aim to take on people who are innovative and able to work independently while others consider they should recruit people who are able to work in a team and follow instructions. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Some people argue that companies should recruit people who are creative and have novel ideas, and can work independently whereas others believe that organizations should hire individuals who are good at team work and following commands. In my opinion, it is better to recruit innovative and independent individuals.
When companies choose individuals who are good at team work and taking commands, it will facilitate the smooth functioning of the organization. The management will not face any issues with these individuals as they are very obedient. These kinds of employees also will be happy and stress free as they need not take any risks. They just need to work according to the instructions given.
Despite the smooth running of the company, I would argue that it is better to choose individuals who are creative and can work independently. Creative minds always have novel ideas. These kinds of employees are an asset to a company because their innovative minds may create new ways of doing activities which can facilitate the overall functioning of the organization. In addition to this, their independent nature enables them to take risk and solve problems when they arise. For example, in a company if shortage of employees arises for a small period, a creative and independent project manager will find out new ways to complete the project within time and with fewer employees.
In conclusion, even though obedient employees with good team spirit can help in the smooth running of an organization, innovative and independent workers are better as they can help the company when problems arise.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-should-companies-hire-innovative-and-independent-workers-instead-of-team-players
1027,Is it better for college students to live at school accommodation than live at home with their parents? Do you agree or disagree?,"Living environment has a great influence on students’ life especially their academic achievement. Both types of accommodation have their own merits and demerits. However, in my perspective / opinion, it is a better option for students to stay in college accommodation.
There are several benefits to staying in college hostel. One of the main reasons is that students will gain confidence and become more responsible. This is because students who live in the college dormitory must assume responsibility for all aspects of their life. For example in the college accommodation they have to cook the food, clean the room, wash the clothes and so on. In addition, another advantage of choosing on campus residence is that they can access easily all the campus facilities. Since hostels and dormitories are close to the campus, students can easily access the libraries and various other learning resources available at the university. Moreover, in a hostel students are exposed to a diverse environment with people from various social and cultural backgrounds. As a result, students are better prepared to live in a multi-cultural world.
Despite the above mentioned advantages some people argue that students should stay with their parents. In their opinion, hostel life offers students unrestricted freedom and hence they can do whatever they want and they may even get into bad company. These fears aren’t baseless; however, one should not ignore the fact that college hostels are run under the strict supervision of college staff.
In conclusion, university life is very important for students because it is the time to mould their personality and character for tomorrow and campus accommodation offers an opportunity to develop their personality. Therefore, in my opinion, they should stay in college hostels.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-is-it-better-for-students-to-stay-in-college-accommodation
1028,Some people believe that the government should not spend money on international aid when they have their own disadvantaged people like homeless and unemployed. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Over the last 100 years, population has grown at an exponential rate across many countries in the world. This brings along with it its own problems such as poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and so on. Many governments allocate huge resources to tackle these problems. Since all governments have problems to solve in their own countries, I agree with the argument that their first priority should be their own people.
There are ample reasons why I believe that the government should put the welfare of its own people ahead of others. To begin with, financial resources are becoming scarce and many countries are already in debt. These funds must be reserved for the development and maintenance of its own institutions and social security measures such as free health care and shelters for homeless people. Secondly, such welfare schemes not only elevate people out of poverty; they also help the government indirectly by creating jobs. This, in turn, facilitates the economic growth of the country.
On the other hand, it is understandable and reasonable to donate money to the poorer nations as a gesture of basic human decency and humanity. No nation, after all, can live in prosperity when its neighbours are struggling with poverty. By offering financial assistance to their poor neighbours, countries can also put a curb on illegal immigration. Even so, in my opinion, solving problems in one’s own country is more important than venturing to help others. Others should be helped only when the donating country has a surplus of money and resources.
In conclusion, there are obvious benefits for the government in the long run from donating money as relief aids to many foreign countries. However, I strongly iterate that the government must first improve the economic, financial and employment prospects of its own people before embarking on humanitarian work abroad.",7.5,band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample-governments-should-no-spend-money-on-international-aid-when-they-have-their-own-disadvantaged-people
1029,Some parents believe that children should go to school while others feel that they should be taught at home. Are there more benefits studying in a school than at home?,"While some parents choose to believe that regular schooling is beneficial, some others opt to educate their children at home. In my opinion, going to school offers more benefits than being home schooled.
In schools, children are bound to meet other children of different backgrounds and cultures. This gives them different perspectives of others’ cultures and norms. Also, it teaches them to be tolerant of those who are different. Besides, different subjects are taught by different teachers allowing different viewpoints and knowledge to be acquired. This is unlikely the case when a child is being home-schooled. Most of the knowledge is acquired from one or both parents who usually have similar stances. In addition, at school, children get to interact and socialize with their peers. When it comes to homeschooling, chances of such interactions are minimal despite the fact that parents may organize play dates.
Thus, social skills are easily attained in a school environment than at home. Therefore, it is important to note that school prepares an individual for the real world wherein you have to interact with people outside your social circle.
On the other hand, being home-schooled has its own sets of advantages too. The study schedule can be flexible and there is more room for incorporating unconventional subjects and interests. This eventually creates a love for learning, which can be diminished in current school settings where grades matter most.

In conclusion, I believe that the benefits of going to school definitely outweigh those of being homeschooled. Social skills are better honed in a school than at home.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-regular-schooling-vs-home-schooling
1030,"In the past, the main role of teachers was providing information. Today with various sources of information available to students, teachers have no role in modern education. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the recent past, we have witnessed a tremendous increase in the number of online courses being offered to students in various subjects. This has surely decreased the dependence on traditional classroom education for many. However, in my opinion the role of teachers in learning cannot be replaced by any other mode of education.
It can be agreedthat online courses offer number of benefits. First and foremost, students can learn anytime and from anywhere in the world. Course can be selected on the basis of one’s schedule. For Instance, students can study while sitting at the comfort of their homes or while traveling. Secondly, students can also choose the pace of the course they are studying. Every student has a different ability of learning and, can taketime till they have fully understood the lesson.
On the other hand, it can be argued that conventional classroom teaching is best for the holistic development of a child. Classroom teaching encourages debates and discussion which enhances the learning ability of children and it encourages health competition as well. These 2 attributes work like assets while securing employment positions in future. Further, teachers respond to student’s queries in real time which is absent in online courses. Various subjects such as chemistry and biology need the controlled environment of laboratories for learning; experiments conducted by students needs to be monitored by teachers for safety and better understanding.
To sum up, though the popularity of online courses is increasing due to ease of study and the availability of a plethora subjects offered, still it cannot replace traditional classroom studying with the help of teachers. Teachers form an integral part of learning and development of children.",7.5,band-6-5-ielts-essay-sample-teachers-have-no-place-in-modern-education
1031,Decades ago man landed on the moon and people said that its the first step towards greater things. But others say that space travel has made little difference in others lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"When man first landed on moon nearly half a century ago optimists believed that humanity had taken a giant leap on the road to excellence. On the contrary others had the notion that man’s invention of travelling to outer space has not made any significant impact to human lives. I echo that thought and feel that breakthrough in the field of aeronautical science has not yielded the desired results. Rather it would have been more fruitful if we had invested in solving for potential life saving issues that exist in today’s world. This essay will also highlight the potential danger to life the astronaut faces on such missions.
Developed countries like the US, China, Russia and the UK invest astronomical amounts as part of there budget’s towards space exploration on the pretext of being able to discover some path breaking discovery that could potentially save the course of humanity. The money spent on building futuristic technology could have alternatively been used to address other pressing concerns that exist today in our day to day lives. For instance a developing country like India allocates close to 7% of its total budget towards technological advancements in the space travel industry, however it would have been judicious to use these finds or at least a part of it towards addressing the most pressing issue of poverty and unemployment.
Space travel an also be dangerous. Every astronaut has to deal with potential risks to their life. Millions of dollars are lost because of failed experiments, crashes due to technical glitches and not to mention the number of lives lost during these dangerous missions in alien environments. All of these experiments are done with a motto of being able to discover something that would help our future generations. Unfortunately all of this is coming at a huge cost which all of us are a part of.
To summarize I feel that man reaching the moon and it being a sign of greater things to come is a little over hyped. To be fair these experiments have provided insights of facts that we were not aware of, however all of this comes at a huge premium. I don’t see the return on investment and feel that we would be better off using this investment for other pressing issues and at the same time not risk human lives in such dangerous expeditions.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-mans-landing-on-moon-had-little-consequence-for-humanity
1032,"Some companies sponsor sports as a way to advertise themselves. Some people think it is good, while others think there are disadvantages to this. Discuss both sides and give your opinion","Some multinational companies sponsor major sports events in order to advertise their products. Some people have positive opinion about this, while others believe that there are certain downsides to this. In my opinion, when multinational companies sponsor sporting events, it is advantageous for them and the sports.
When big companies sponsor sports events, both the parties benefit. Sports events are promoted and people will be motivated to participate in various sports activities. In addition to this, talented youngsters may get inspired by the fame and money that accomplished players get and will want to pursue a career in sports. By showing their advertisements during these events, companies which sponsor them can reach more consumers. Thus organizations will get more profit. Many firms such as Airtel, Idea and Pepsi funded many sports competitions and this enhanced their publicity.
On the other hand, there are also certain drawbacks to this. It may deflect the attention of people from sports to their products. In addition, when ads are shown during sporting events, they may dampen the spirit and enthusiasm of the spectators. Hence it may not arouse real sports spirit in people.
In conclusion, even though product adverts distract viewers of sports competitions to a small extent, sports events are promoted to a great extent during these competitions which are sponsored by big multinational firms. So it is good that sports events are sponsored by big organizations.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-when-mncs-sponsor-sporting-events-is-it-good
1033,Many criminals commit crimes after they were set free. Research indicates that the people who were convicted criminals would often commit crimes when they are set free. Why is this the case? What can be done to solve this issue?,"According to the statistics, inmates are more likely to commit a crime within five years after their release. In this essay, I will discuss the factors that encourage convicts to reoffend and also suggest some solutions to tackle this problem.
One of the factors that can potentially lead to committing a crime repeatedly is lenient punishments. Many people argue that some of the punishments are not harsh and must be more strict. Moreover, it is argued that conditions in some prisons are too pleasant and the prisoners have many comforts, such as cable and internet. This cannot be considered as sufficient punishment, and also it does not act as a deterrent for those who commit crimes.  Thus, community services could be a more effective form of  punishment. In addition, criminals who does not pose a threat to the society can be given an opportunity to improve local areas by doing voluntary work.
Another reason that encourage reoffeding is that prisons often focus on punishments instead of rehabilitation. It’s generally known that imprisonment, in most cases, does not reform the criminals. On the contrary, it can create hardened criminals as in the prison they are in the company of other criminals. To solve this problem, proactive rehabilitation programs should be implemented in prisons to discourage people of committing a crime, and also in order to reform the criminals.
To sum up, there are at least a few ways to prevent convicted criminals from repeating offenses. One of them is to ask them to engage in community work. The other is to provide rehabilitation programmes for them. If criminals can lead a normal life and make meaningful contributions to the society after their release, they are less likely to reoffend.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-convicted-criminals-commit-more-crimes-after-getting-released-from-prison
1034,"There has been a dramatic growth in the number of people studying at universities in the last few decades. While some people see this as a positive trend which raises the general level of education within the community, others fear that it is lowering the quality of education. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the increase in student numbers at university?","Over the last few decades, there has been a sharp increase in the number of students enrolling in/at universities. Some people opine that the main benefit of this is the increase in the educational level of people. Others, however, think that this trend has a negative impact on the quality of education. In this essay, I will explain why it is an advantage that more students are going to university and why larger size classes can decrease the quality of education.
On the one hand, if universities receive a higher number of students, there will also be a corresponding increase in the number of people with professional skills. This will eventually benefit the economy because educated people are an asset. University gives theoretical knowledge that can be applied to make more informed decisions in the society. To illustrate more than 60 % of the population have a bachelor’s degree in countries such as United States and Australia, which has allowed them to be first world countries.
On the other hand, the quality of education can be compromised when there are more people in the classroom. Universities often use the same amount of resources to teach a class of 40 and a class of 100. This will definitely compromise the quality of education. For example, in Colombia teachers receive the same salary whether a class has 10 students or 50 students. Consequently, they are less interested in teaching large classes because it is more work for the same amount of money.
In conclusion, the increasing number of students in higher education has advantages and disadvantages. Although the quality of the classes can be affected, this trend is generally advantageous for the society. People who have studied at university are more resourceful and benefit the economy of the nation in several ways.",7.5,band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample-there-is-a-sharp-increase-in-the-number-of-people-studying-at-university
1035,"Some people say that in all levels of education, from primary schools to universities, too much time is spent on learning facts and not enough on learning practical skills. Do you agree or disagree ?","Some people argue that learning facts is given too much time in all education levels while little time is allocated for learning practical abilities. I strongly agree with the aforementioned argument for several reasons. Let me elaborate.
To begin with, one of the main reasons why too much time is given for studying facts at schools and universities is that facts are very crucial for our life. Facts give us knowledge about ourselves, our planet and our environment. Without facts we will not be able to fight diseases, discover things that benefit us as human beings and even avoid dangers that our planet might face in the future. For instance, facts have helped us understand what is making our planet warmer which is the increased level of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. As a result, people now use more environmentally friendly products to reduce global warming. This clearly shows that spending too much time learning facts at school and universities is very important.
Furthermore, unlike facts, practical abilities could be learned at technical institutes outside the formal education system. This is because practical skills do not need formal lectures and research which are very crucial in learning facts. For example, in Sudan, there are approximately thirty technical institutes where students learn practical skills such as plumbing, carpentry and electricity. So, practical abilities can be acquired outside schools and universities.
To sum up, I strongly agree with the argument that too much times is given to learn facts at schools and universities and at the same time little time is spent for learning practical abilities. Learning facts is important to understand our surroundings and practical abilities could be learned outside formal education system.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-education-focuses-on-facts-rather-than-practical-skills
1036,The population in most cities is growing as people move to cities to find work and new opportunities. What problem does overpopulation in the cities cause? How can these problems be solved?,"The population of the world is an ever increasing number. In most parts of the world, the cities are densely populated. Moreover, this figure keeps on increasing as people move to urban areas for jobs and better opportunities. Overcrowding of the cities leads to multiple problems. The government and civic authorities can help mitigate this problem by taking appropriate steps.
Overpopulation poses multiple problems and concerns for a city. Often, people have trouble seeking accommodation, those who do not have sufficient funds resort to staying in shanties and slums. Lack of proper living facilities leads to a variety of health and hygiene problems. There are limited opportunities to find work, so people take up odd jobs in order to earn their daily bread. Transportation is also affected. Transport facilities are designed to cater to the needs of many commuters. Overpopulation is a burden upon transport facilities and this is seen in many cities today; overcrowded trains, buses and multiple traffic jams. Overall overpopulation is a strain on the economy and environment.
The government needs to devise methods and ways to combat this issue. Proper civic planning is a must. Taking audits and census on a variety of parameters related to the public is a necessity. Strategies can then be implemented in phases to curb this issue. Providing better jobs and other facilities in parts outside the city is the need of the hour. Passing certain regulations and tabling laws regarding residency and citizenship can help limit overcrowding. For instance, any individual wishing to reside in the city must possess the appropriate documents and reasons for such a move.
In conclusion, overpopulation poses a significant threat on the world today. The government and civic officials need to develop solutions or look for alternatives in order to tackle this issue.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-problems-caused-by-overcrowding-in-cities
1037,Nowadays for many people the internet is replacing regular books. What do you think will happen in the future and what is your opinion about this trend?,"In recent years, the usage of internet on the electronic gadgets has become quite popular among readers. Some people believe that the increasing use of the internet has made regular books redundant. However, others insist that the conventional method of reading paper books is the optimum way of learning and cannot be replaced by the internet or other sources. In my point of view, we will see more digitalization of the print media in the near future and the majority of the population will switch to electronic books and content.
First of all, the growing usage of mobiles and laptops among the youngsters has changed the way of reading and studying. A plethora of books and magazines are available on the internet free of cost. As a result of this, many universities and schools now have decided to allow students to use the internet in the classrooms and libraries. Besides that, eBooks are environment friendly as they eliminate the need to cut down trees for the production of paper books. Moreover, eBooks are easy to share as no parcels are required to deliver them from one place to another.
On the other hand, the traditional method of reading has its own benefits.Though books are heavy to carry and require a lot of care, readers can easily make notes and highlight keywords. Internet users are not able to do this. In addition to that, kids and school students learn faster by reading books rather than e-books. Books don’t need electricity and other required electric set ups to start reading. A recent report published in the UK elaborate that the people who read books possess better memory than those who use the internet.
To conclude, popularity of the internet reading has significantly increased among the readers. This changing trend has been accepted mostly by youngsters, while there are still many readers who believe in the conventional method of reading books. In my opinion, it is absolutely necessary to go with the flow as digital versions of books are the future as they are reliable, cost efficient and environment friendly.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-the-internet-is-replacing-regular-books
1038,"In many places, new homes are needed, but the only space available for building them is in the countryside. Some people believe it is more important to protect the countryside and not build new homes there.","In many parts of the world, there has been a stimulating discussion about whether or not to build new homes in the countryside. Some people argue that building new houses in the countryside is less important than the protection of these zones. In my opinion, the countryside is the most important place for any civilization because it is where the majority of food grows and animals are feed in order to supply food to the cities.
Developing suburbs in those areas that are being used for an agricultural purpose might have egregious consequences for the cities. Food has been harvested in these places for over ten years and farmers know the number of crops that they will produce at the end of the season. Building new homes in these areas could create a huge issue to farmers as they may be relocated to an unknown zone. Therefore, they will have to learn the weather, soil and pests conditions, and as a consequence, they might harvest a reduce amount of crops in comparison to the previous location, which will lead to an increase in the market price. To illustrate, in 2014 it was reported by The Daily Mail in Geelong, Australia that the release of farmland with building purposes lead to skyrocketed the rice price as the production was reduced by more than fifty percent. This forced Australians to buy rice from overseas at higher prices that they used to buy before the new development.
Farm animals will be relocated to new lands if the space available is assigned to new developments. Animals living in the countryside have a certain type of grass or food in their diet, and these nutrients might not be available in the new location. Thus, this could lead to several human diseases and to an increase in the veterinarian expenses to look after the health of the farm animals. For example, a study made by The University of California showed that in San Diego the relocation of a cattle creates a bacteria in the milk production due to a new type of grass. Which caused the waste of more than one million liters of milk and the hospitalization of several people.
To conclude, In my point of view, the countryside is vital for the human being and using this space with the purpose of new living spaces might create consequences that are going to cost more than finding new locations for these properties to be built. Crops might be reduced the production in numbers and animals can be acquired sickness that might affect the inhabitants of the area.",7.5,band-6-5-ielts-essay-sample-the-countryside-should-be-used-for-building-homes
1039,It is important to have huge public spaces like parks and squares in towns and cities. Do you agree or disagree with the given statement?,"There has been some discussion about the existence and need of parks and squares in towns and cities. While some people believe that these open premises are essential, others insist that these places make the land useless and hence they must be converted to practical purposes. In my opinion, despite the voices against the larger public places, parks and squares provide great value to both the towns and its civilians.
First of all, the open areas have always been considered as the heart of cities, where people get together for meetings and leisure activities. Besides that children and their parents spend quality time at these places after their hectic daily schedules. The increasing pollution in cities is a cause of great concern for the government and the citizens and places like parks and squares often provide relaxation to the old people. Moreover, such places attract tourists as they usually have a history behind their creation. For instance, all European towns are famous for their beautiful gardens and city center squares. Thus, it’s absolutely imperative to conserve them for the future generations.
On the other hand, one can’t deny the fact that cities are getting crowded each day and lacking places to build public and commercial centers. New transportation systems are coming to the cities and they need a large space to build stations and wider lanes. For example, New York was planned nearly two hundred years ago and the roads in the city were small and narrow which were built for carts not for cars and buses. Later, New York city authority converted many historical parks and gardens into parking stations and highways. This transformation was publicly criticized by civilians and other town planners. Therefore, destroying parks and other public places for current benefits is not the solution for space constraints in cities.
In conclusion, big public grounds are the need of our future generations. Cities are facing a lot of pressure to develop a substantial infrastructure for the growing population, but this cannot be allowed at the cost of parks and squares. Therefore, it’s completely indispensable to have huge social places in the cities and towns.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-it-is-important-to-have-huge-public-spaces-like-parks-and-squares-in-towns-and-cities
1040,"Discipline is an ever increasing problem in modern schools. Some people think that discipline should be the responsibilities of teachers, while other thinks this is role of parents. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In today’s times, there has been a dramatic rise in disciplinary issues in most schools. Most people believe that the children should be disciplined at schools by their teacher, while others think that this is the prime responsibility of the parents. In my opinion, it is the responsibility of both the teachers and parents.
On one hand, teachers have a moral obligation of imparting knowledge as well as discipline to their students. Academics should go hand in hand with values and morals. It is the duty of a teacher to train his or her student. Schools make it necessaryfor a pupil to be punished if the pupil has not followed the rules and regulations of the school. For instance, failing to submit an assignment or project by its deadline may lead to loss of marks or other consequences may arise.
On the other hand, parents play a fundamental role in moulding a child. They are the first persons to instill values, morals and discipline in their child. As there is a very intimate relationship between children and their parents, they have a greater control over their children. Children fear their parents more than their teachers, for example, a child maybe naughty at school but portray the best behavior when at home. Parents are ultimately the ones who can correct the faults and shortcomings of their children.
To sum up, teachers and parents have been bestowed with the power and right to discipline children. They need to collaborate together to help the child have a better tomorrow.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-think-that-parents-are-responsible-for-teaching-children-discipline
1041,"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?","Smart workers are the need of the hour. Therefore it’s imperative that the youth is also armed with the best training. Education is integral but having the work experience also plays a very important role.
World has started realizing the importance of on the job training. Firstly, it not only helps in developing a child’s intellect but also makes them understand the importance of balancing work and studies. Secondly, they learn to be more disciplined and independent when they do part time jobs. Thirdly, learning while earning also helps in better understanding of the concepts studied.  In some nations of the world children are engaged in paid work from a young age, because they feel that this not only teaches them the value of money but also helps them identify their future goals.
On the other hand, a few people are against this practice. They believe that the children should only focus on studies and working at a young age is completely wrong. According to them, a job is too much of a responsibility for children and it snatches their childhood from them. Such people don’t even believe in the concept of extra-curricular activities because academic education is the prime focus for them. Some people also connect the concept with social status which is totally illogical but such hurdles have stopped many from working while studying.
In my opinion, children should be allowed to work while studying so that they learn to be independent. The future also demands smart work forces which can only be produced this way.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-children-should-engage-in-paid-work
1042,Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Introducing a new language in elementary school curriculum is considered as more effective than teaching the same at secondary school. In my opinion, merits of learning a foreign language at an early age are far higher than its demerits.
Some people believe that children may confuse the foreign language with their mother tongue when they learn it at a younger age. However, research has proven that young children are better than older children at learning pronunciation, vocabulary and rhythm of the language. They will also achieve higher levels of proficiency at the end of the secondary school education, if they start to learn it early. For this reason I think learning a new language is more effective in primary school than in secondary school.
Learning a new language early in the life can make children more tolerant of multicultural societies. Some parents are worried that if they teach a foreign language their children may forget their culture and tradition. However, according to a recent survey children who are exposed to a foreign language at a young age can easily understand various cultures and traditions. As a result, they are more comfortable and flexible when they live in a multicultural society. Thus, being bilingual will make them culturally competent and less anxious to face a foreign society in their future life.
In conclusion, although some people are against teaching foreign languages to young people, I believe that it is beneficial for young children as it improves their cultural competence and language skills.

1043,Today the quality of life in large cities is decreasing. Discuss the causes and suggest solutions.,"Some people believe that urban dwellers do not enjoy good quality of life. Anecdotal evidence shows that city life is stressful to mankind and depression is rampant in the overcrowded cities.
The most prominent reason behind this is that interaction among the urban people is on the fall. They often fail to communicate effectively with their neighbors and friends, which in turn creates a sense of insecurity among individuals. Each and every person is living in their own isolated virtual world, unable to share their feelings and emotions or exude empathy towards each other, creating far reaching repercussions. For instance, children dwelling in cities are prone to depression, when compared to village children. Hence it is clear that the rampant lack of communication among people in overcrowded cities is the rudimentary reason behind the decrease in quality of their life. Urban dwellers also have to cope with several other issues like pollution, traffic congestion and higher cost of living. Pollution increases their risk of developing various illnesses and even reduces their longevity.
There are several solutions to this problem. Making urban areas less congested by improving employment opportunities in rural areas is one of them. It is also important to improve interaction between people. Regular social occasions, events or games can be arranged by the like-minded groups to encourage people to socialize. Such platforms must be made available to the public so that they can share their feelings and engage in teamwork. Thus they can reduce the stress of city life and improve its quality.
To sum up, even though modern facilities are readily available in urban regions, quality and moral standards of life are deteriorating rapidly due to a variety of reasons. However, these problems can be solved to a great extent if the government and the residents take concerted action.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-quality-of-life-in-cities-is-declining
1044,"With the increased global demand for oil and gas, some people believe that undiscovered areas of the world should be opened up to access more resources. Do you agree or disagree?","Since the global demand for oil and gas is on the rise some people believe that the government has to allow the exploration of undiscovered areas for more resources. I strongly disagree with this view as this not the viable solution to meet the world’s ever increasing oil and gas demand.
To start with, gas and oil are non-renewable energy sources and there is no guarantee that their supply will last forever. We have already exhausted most of the fossil fuels. Therefore, in my opinion, people’s focus should be on the development of renewable energy sources such as solar, hydro power and wind to name a few.
To elaborate, renewable energy sources are cost effective as they are abundantly available. We only have to harness them using the right technology. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are harmful to the environment in many ways. They are the number one cause of air pollution which causes several health problems in humans.
Exploring unexplored areas for more fossil fuels will only make the situation worse. While this might meet our energy demands for the time being, the damage done to the environment will be irreparable and as such this is not a viable solution. The main focus of authorities, right now, must be on the development of renewable energy sources to meet the growing energy demand.
To conclude, the global demand for energy will only continue in the coming years. But exploiting new and undiscovered resources is not the solution to this problem. Instead, we should invest in renewable sources of energy.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-in-order-to-meet-growing-energy-requirements-undiscovered-places-should-be-opened-up
1045,"Some employers want to be able to contact their staff at all times, even on holidays. Does this development have more disadvantages than advantages?","In today’s competitive world, employers want to be able to contact their employees no matter where they are in order to maintain smooth operations. This approach may have many positives, but it does have a few negatives as well.
To start with, it is important to be able to contact an employee especially during difficult times at work on in case of an emergency. For example, hospitals need to be able to contact their staff in case of patient emergencies, trauma and calamities. This may help save a life or many lives. In times of troubleshooting certain tasks, a phone call or email may save a presentation, project or win a deal for an organization). Certain organizations, call centres for instance, need their staff on-call throughout the year. Any failure to do so may lead to loss of business and revenue.
Contacting employees does not always benefit employers. To begin with, no employee likes to be contacted by their employer when they are at home or on holiday. This may invoke a feeling of resentment towards the employer. Some individuals are forced to work round the clock. They even take their work home. This leads to overworking, which may further lead to health risks and other related issues. Moreover, the employee may feel unhappy at his workplace and may even consider seeking job opportunities elsewhere. No employer benefits from an unhappy workforce as it may affect the growth and success of an organization.
In conclusion, contacting an employee may prove fruitful in certain situations, it may have a bearing on employee happiness and health. It could even lead to attrition.",7.5,band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample-some-employers-want-to-be-able-to-contact-their-employees-at-all-times
1046,Human activity has had a negative impact on plants and animals around the world. Some people believe that this cannot be changed while others believe actions can be taken to bring about a change.,"There is no denying the fact that human activity has caused considerable damage to plants and animals / wildlife. An army of people hold the view that nothing can be done about this, while others believe that the government has to take some measures to deal with this danger. In my opinion, change will occur only with the joint effort of the society and the authority.
There are people who state that change will occur if the government enacts laws to protect the environment. I agree with this. There is no doubt that some measures should be taken to tackle the issues faced by animals and plants. Afforestation, for example, is one of the viable solutions to deforestation which has a direct impact on plants and animals. Moreover, the government has to conduct campaigns in schools and other public gathering places to educate the population about the importance of plants and animals on earth. Beyond that, authorities can keep animals, which are on the verge of extinction in zoos.
Of course, there are people who believe that it is impossible to create any change since humans are materialistic in nature and do not much care about animals and plants. Moreover, the government’s primary priority is always the well-being of humankind as such they hardly take actions for the preservation of endangered species.
In conclusion, even though people have diverse opinions about the need to protect endangered plants and animals, I strongly support the view that some measures have to be implemented in order to create a stable environment for the wildlife to survive.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-human-activity-has-had-significant-negative-impact-on-the-planet
1047,"It is very clear now that English should be the primary foreign language taught in all schools around the world. Learning a different foreign language before English, in today’s world is a waste of time. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","English is a universal language. Though there are many widely spoken languages such as Mandarin, Hindi and Spanish, no language ever comes close to the English language. Therefore, I do agree that learning another foreign language before English is indeed a waste of precious time.
The English language is being used as the main medium of communication in most parts of the world. As an illustration, most of the websites and content on the Internet are mainly in English. In the same way, when travelling abroad to study, work or for leisure, English is the preferred language. Business transactions take place in English. For this reason, it is important to realize that English is the fastest growing and most influential medium of communication worldwide.
It is true that other foreign languages such as German, Japanese or Spanish are also offered in schools. Even so, none of these languages has the same impact as English on the world. For instance, an individual who is highly proficient in English has higher and better chances of landing a skilled job almost anywhere than someone who is lacking in this aspect. In fact, English opens up more opportunities than any other language.  Though there are more Mandarin speakers than English speakers, many of them are still choosing to pick up English. For this reason, indeed, it is a language that is sure to open doors to opportunities.
To conclude, for a non-native speaker, learning English is more beneficial than learning any other language. There is no harm in learning another foreign language but if a person learns only one foreign language, then it makes more sense for them to choose English.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-it-is-useless-to-learn-another-foreign-language-before-english
1048,"Many stores sell organic fruits and vegetables (produced without the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides) even though they often cost more than conventional fruits and vegetables. Why do some people prefer to eat organic food? Do you think organic food is worth the extra cost?","The growing number of adverts on fruits and vegetables produced naturally without the use of chemicals, point to the growing popularity of organic food. Nowadays, people are increasingly health conscious and don’t mind the additional cost that comes with organic food. And I think it is worth the extra price.
People are aware of the consequences that one has to face when it comes to consuming food produce laced with chemicals. It is a known fact that in the absence of a controlled environment, insects and other biological agents affect the yield of vegetables and fruits. And farmers resort to chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides in an attempt to increase yield. It is proven that the usage of chemicals cause major health issues such as cancer and drug resistance.
While it might look like an expensive deal with organic food, it is actually not. Direct comparison of costs between organic and conventionally grown food, indicate higher costs of organic food. However, the extra cost is nothing when compared to the hospital bills that one might incur as a result of the side effects of ingesting the chemicals. Ensuring good health is a wise investment. This can bring in a whole lot of benefits to all the members of the family and in extension to society at large.
Understandably, organic farming involves additional costs to maintain a pest free environment without using chemicals. But one has to take into account the many advantages that it has to offer and not get influenced merely by the short term gains of conventionally grown fruits and vegetables.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-many-stores-sell-organic-fruits-and-vegetables-although-they-are-expensive
1049,"Essay topics: Some people say that children should play games which require teamwork such as football and basketball. Whereas, some think they should be doing individual sports such as swimming and running. Do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that in their spare time, youngsters should play games like football and basketball which require teamwork. While I agree with this argument to some extent, I believe that children should also play individual games such as swimming and running.
There are several benefits to playing team sports. Firstly, team sports are more enjoyable and all children like to play with their friends or peers. Studies have shown that children who play with their peers are more satisfied than those who play alone. Secondly, while playing team events, children learn teamwork and improve their communication skills. For example, in order to win a football / cricket match, they cannot rely solely on one person. So they work together and make a plan to achieve their goal.
On the other hand, I also believe participating in individual activities has many advantages. One advantage is that playing alone is much easier because they do not have to gather a group of people to start. For instance, if a child wants to improve his running performance, he can practice alone. He does not have to find another person to run with him. Another advantage is that children who engage in individual activities are more likely to become independent. This ability plays an important role in the success of a person, because this kind of person is capable of leading others and achieving their goals.
In conclusion, although team activities benefit children in many ways individual games also have their own advantages. So, I would argue that children should play both types of games.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-individual-games-vs-games-that-require-team-work

On the one hand, in my opinion, there are several benefits for children when they play teammate games. Firstly, it is often more enjoyable when children can play with their friends. According to a recent research, scientists have confirmed that the number of children playing games with their peers is more satisfying than those who play alone. Secondly, while joining in these types of games, children can learn how to communicate and be a part of a team.

On the other hand, I also believe participating in individual activities has many advantages. One advantage is that playing alone is much easier because they do not have to gather a group of people to operate a game. For instance, if a child wants to improve his running performance, instead of wasting time waiting to run with someone, he can practice whenever he wants. Another advantage is that the development of such crucial characteristic as independence is attributed mostly in doing individual activities. This ability plays an important role in the success of a person, because this kind of person is capable of leading other and achieve high goal.

1051,"Nowadays people buy a lot of things even though they don’t really need them. Why is it happening, in your opinion? Is it a positive or negative trend for the individual and the society?","Since the end of the Second World War, the shopping concepts have continuously changed. Nowadays, people have become more careless about what they buy, and sometimes they even buy what they don’t need. In my opinion, this is a negative approach mainly due to a sociological reason which is behind this behavior.
The main social reason is that people continuously need to prove that they are successful in their careers and they are affluent. Therefore, they may buy many unnecessary items such as expensive clothes or luxurious cars that may not even be suitable for them. Take, for instance, the case of buying expensive speedy cars in Nigeria where the roads are not suitable for such cars. This clearly shows that people are trying to show off their wealth in a way that is potentially damaging to the society. Such negative attitude of the people can cause other social problems. While affluent people can afford to buy unnecessary products, destitute people are suffering from poverty and illiteracy and such behavior maybe harmful to them. Hence, if this wasted money is oriented toward improving poor people’s conditions, the society will become more stable and crimes will decrease drastically.
Unquestionably, that will foster a sense of fraternity and well-being among citizens and will enhance the overall economy of the country as people’s financial resources are directed to the most important sectors. Therefore, proceeding in this direction will devastate our communities. Thus, it has become mandatory that we change our damaging lifestyles.
To conclude, people create immense social pressure on other members of the society due to their damaging buying habits. They must give up this negative trend to ensure the happiness and welfare of all social sectors.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-people-are-buying-things-they-dont-want
1052,Young people are leaving their homes in rural areas to study or work in the cities. What are the reasons? Do advantages of this development outweigh its disadvantages?,"Migration from rural areas to cities has become more prevalent due to the availability of better universities and job opportunities there. While some people argue that the disadvantages of this phenomenon outweigh the merits, I believe that this development is beneficial in many ways.
There are two main reasons which urge people to leave their rural villages and towns and move to the cities. The first reason is that most of the universities are located in the cities and these universities attract the ambitious students who want to earn higher degrees. The second reason is that the job market in the cities is more active and therefore, it is much easier for professionals to find jobs there compared to the rural areas where the economic activities are limited.
There is no doubt that there are several disadvantages to this migration such as the exponential population growth in the cities which hits the cities’ infrastructure severely and also this migration leaves the rural areas abandoned and demotes some necessary professions such as farming. But, on the other hand, moving to cities has two major merits for the individuals and nations also have immensely benefited from this phenomenon.
The major advantage gained is the remarkable increase in the numbers of the university graduates which ultimately increases the society’s education level. The second merit is that cities allow more people to have better jobs and enhance their financial conditions.
In conclusion, most of the people in rural areas tend to move to big cities for reasons related to their career and their education. Although there are some disadvantages to this issue, we cannot deny that the individuals and society are benefiting much from this phenomenon.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-young-people-are-leaving-their-homes-and-villages-and-moving-to-cities
1053,"Learning English is often seen as more important than learning local languages. If these are not taught, many are at risk of dying out. In your opinion, is it important for everyone to learn English? Should we try to ensure the survival of local languages and if so how?","More emphasis is often placed on learning English than on learning other languages and this has led to the extinction of many local languages.  In my opinion learning native languages is as significant as learning English and appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that equal importance is given to learning local languages in educational institutions.
There are several benefits to learning English. In the age of internet where the entire world has become a global village the need to be able to communicate in a language known to all is of paramount importance. Thus learning English which is touted as the link language is essential to be able to express your vision and ideas on an international platform. Failing to do so can lead to our chances being squashed.
However, this emphasis on learning English has discouraged many people from learning local languages and in my opinion, this is a negative development. This world is made up of people of different colour, religion, race and culture. Each one is equally important and represents the diverse nature of the world that we live in. Many studies have repeatedly proven that learning multiple languages at an early age helps in mental growth. Children who learn multiple languages exhibit an increased level of intelligence when compared to children who learn a single language. Thus it is very important to enable and encourage children to learn multiple languages.
There are many ways in which children can be encouraged to learn their native languages. One way of doing so is to instill in them the notion that all languages are equal and none has superiority over another. This can be done by giving special incentives to kids who perform better in native languages thus igniting that competitive spark among them. Another way is to make it a compulsory part of the syllabus.
In conclusion, I would like to insist that local languages should be given the same importance as English and children should be encouraged to learn them.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-should-everyone-learn-english
1054,People living in cities today do not get enough exercise. Why? What can be done to solve this problem?,"These days, it is true that in urban centres people do not exercise adequately. There are several reasons behind this unhealthy development. Fortunately, there are several solutions too.
To begin with, there are different reasons why people in urban areas do not exercise enough. The first reason is that there are not many designated areas for exercising in cities. This is because nowadays cities are overcrowded and do not have enough land to accommodate the increasing number of people who migrate to them. For example, in 2008, the Sudanese government began to build new apartment blocks in public spaces that were earlier used as exercising areas.  As a result, people now struggle to find places where they can exercise.
Furthermore, people who live in cities are now busier than in the past. They work very hard to make a living for themselves and their families. In other words, space constraints and time constraints are the main reasons that discourage urban dwellers from getting enough exercise.
Fortunately, there are several ways to tackle this issue. First of all, the government should provide free facilities where people can exercise. This will definitely encourage more people to get physically active. The government also needs to create awareness about the importance of staying physically active. They can rope in respected public personalities to drive home the message that regular exercise improves health and longevity.
To sum up, it is evident that lack of public spaces and the busy lifestyle of urban people are the reasons for them not getting enough exercise. However, building exercising facilities and teaching people about the importance of exercising can solve this problem.",7.5,band-8-5-ielts-essay-sample-people-living-in-cities-do-not-get-enough-exercise
1055,Some people believe that playing a musical instrument can be beneficial in many different ways. Others think it is a waste of time to play a musical instrument. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Music has touched the lives of countless people. It means different things to different people. However most people agree about one thing – music can soothe. Yet, there are people who believe that playing a musical instrument is a waste of time. I do not agree with them. In my opinion, this hobby or practice must be encouraged because there are numerous benefits to it.
Those who argue that playing music is a waste of time insist that that time should be used for performing something productive like learning, reading or working. They do not think that playing a musical instrument is a productive activity. Many parents also believe that playing a musical instrument does not improve the academic performance of their children. So, they encourage their children to study instead of playing the guitar or the piano.
On the contrary, people who play musical instruments argue that music helps in improving their mental health conditions by helping them to relax and chill out. Consequently, they have better focus and improved decision making skills.
For instance, many scientists have the habit of playing musical instruments. They believe that music can invigorate their productivity by relaxing their minds and organizing the flow of thoughts. Thus, they use music not only in their spare time but also during their daily work. This clearly shows that music can indirectly enhance people’s productivity.
To sum up, people may have different opinions about the usefulness of music. I believe that those who do not support the playing of musical instruments are not aware of its benefits which are strong enough for everyone to adopt this practice.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-playing-a-musical-instrument-is-a-waste-of-time
1056,IELTS Writing Task 2,"Fossil fuel consumption is increasing globally. Therefore, some people feel that excavation of fuel should be permitted in unexplored areas. I don’t support this.  In my opinion, our world can’t handle any more pollution and diseases. So, searching for other cleaner sources of power is more vital and crucial.
A good reason protect unexplored lands is that the current oil and gas usage increases global warming. In other words, global temperatures are rising gradually due to the excessive use of fossil fuel. As a result, mankind faces the threat of extinction. Moreover, if we do not stop the exploitation of our natural resources, the green areas that form the lungs of our earth will shrink even further. This will also affect our health. In addition to that, diseases will spread more quickly and affect more people because of the emission of poisonous gases and other contaminants from factories. Another point to consider is that undiscovered land should be protected from industrial activities.
As we can see, excessive dependence on fossil fuels is causing serious damage to our planet. Developing green power technologies is the only solution to this problem. These technologies can also decrease the negative effects of contaminated vapors and gases produced by the overuse of fossil fuel. For instance, in Germany almost all car factories run on green power. Such technologies maintain better environmental conditions and in the long term they will also prove to be cheaper than conventional sources. This, in turn, will reduce the cost of manufacturing and make goods and products cheaper and more affordable.
In conclusion, fossil fuels are useful; however, they also have negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, I am convinced that instead of exploring undiscovered lands for more oil and gas, we should invest in green power technologies.",7.5,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-demand-for-oil-and-gas-is-increasing

1060,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students. Note that all band score estimates are approximate.,"Many people consider that exploiting animals for our benefit is fine. However others differ stating that “it is incorrect to use them”. In my opinion, keeping animals as pets and taking care of them is a gesture of kindness and should be supported; however utilizing animals for commercial purposes is absolutely inhumane.
On the one hand, animals like dogs and cats are kept as pets by many people and this ensures their protection and well-being. These pets provide company to their owners and in return get loved and sheltered. Similarly, animals like cows and goats provide milk which is consumed by most people and is also a source of income for many. In return these animals are well fed, taken good care of and given proper treatments as and when required.
On the other hand, misuse of some animals cannot be neglected. For instance, donkeys and camels are often overloaded with excessive baggage. Another example of cruel treatment of animals is conducting drug and cosmetic tests on them for the sole purpose of revenue generation. Many animals not only suffer pain, but also die because of exposure to such products. These unethical practices amount to cruelty towards animals and must not be permitted.
To conclude, I think keeping animals as pets and treating them with humanity and affection is a right thing to do, but exploitation of animals for business profits and other materialistic gains is cruel and should be completely prohibited.",7.5,band-8-5-essay-sample-it-is-unfair-to-use-animals-for-our-benefit

number of sports facilities. Others, however, say that this would have little effect
on public health and that other measures are required.","Some would argue that adding more sports centers is the best solution to enhance public health , while other say that other initiatives are also required for the improvement of health. Although gyms and stadiums can motivate people to engage in physical exercises ,I believe that other initiatives like public awareness programs are also required .
On the one hand, increasing sporting infrastructure brings interest in people to engage in regular exercise like jogging and walking . This help them to be fit,reduce body weight and free from sedentary diseases like diabetics, blood pressure and heart diseases.For example , according to WHO studies the obesity rate in the US is decreased by 20 % after allocating more budget by the states for improvement of sports facilities across the country. However I believe that other steps are also required for improvement of public health.
On the other hand, the government needs to start initiatives to make people aware of importance of regular exercise and healthy food . This awareness program can shed some light on public about the merits of having healthy diet and good exercise. For example , similar awareness program in schools , colleges and media in Japan resulted in decrease in obesity by 25% among teenagers. I believe initiatives like public awareness can bring difference in the thought process of people about lazy life style and bad food habits.
In conclusion, although improving sporting infrastructure can contribute to public health to some extent , I believe measures like public awareness programs can a major role to create a healthy community.",7.5,band-6-5-essay-sample-about-public-health-and-increase-in-sporting-facilities
1062,"Some people think that having a set retirement age (eg : 65 years) for everybody, regardless of occupation, is unfair. They believe that certain workers deserve to retire and receive a pension at an earlier age.","It is often argued that having a fixed retirement age for all working people is not fair. I agree with this view. In this essay I will explain why different jobs require a different retirement age and also state who would benefit from early retirement.
To begin with, it is unfair to treat all jobs alike. Interestingly, some jobs demand round the clock availability. On the other hand, others require just 5-6 hours a day for 5 days a week. This clearly indicates that the amount of effort and efficiency required is different for people working in different sectors. For instance, a bank official who deals primarily with cash exchange needs a lot of attention in the workplace. Any memory lapse or lack of concentration can cause huge losses to the bank. This could be due to old age or long working hours. So, in order to do work efficiently and properly, such people can take retirement early and get their pension.
There is also a set of people who because of their jobs spend a lot of time away from home and their family. A typical example of this is defense personnel who sometimes spend years away from home to guard the borders of the nation. It is the unique nature of their job profile that demands them to do so. Such workers should also be allowed to retire early. They spent their time with utmost dedication and care for their professions. When they are in their late forties or early fifties they should be allowed to spend time with their family and take care of themselves and their near and dear ones with their pension.
To conclude, jobs in sectors like banking, army, aviation and engineering demand high efficiency and attention. Therefore, people working in these and similar sectors should be allowed to take early retirement.",7.5,band-8-5-essay-sample-about-fixed-retirement-age
1063,"Today more and more tourists are visiting places where conditions are difficult, such as Sahara desert or Antarctica. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this travel?","People are choosing unconventional holiday destinations these days. They prefer to visit difficult places like Antarctic or the Sahara desert. In my opinion, this trend has both advantages and disadvantages.  In this essay, I shall discuss the benefits and drawbacks of travelling to unexplored places and underpin my opinion with relevant ideas and examples.
To begin with, now-a-days youngsters are more adventurous and keen to visit some uncommon places. The advantages of offbeat traveling are economic growth and employment generation. If holiday makers commute to unconventional destinations, in order to accommodate them more hotels and resorts are required there. This will lead to the economic development of such places. Holiday destinations must have various restaurants and travel agencies and as a result natives will get more job opportunities.
Regarding the disadvantage of this trend, conditions at those places are difficult for the survival of tourists and can put their life in danger. For instance, the temperature of Sahara desert is unbearable for an outsider. Due to excessive heat a human being can suffer a hypovolemic shock and sometimes death may occur. Therefore it is important to gather appropriate knowledge about the local conditions of a place before planning a trip. What’s more, places like Antarctica have a delicate ecosystem. The influx of tourists will cause considerable damage to such areas.
To conclude, undoubtedly travel to offbeat places leads to economic benefits and sounds interesting but on the other hand it will be dangerous for a tourist to visit such destinations. Hence it is crucial to get a doctor’s approval and do some basic research before undertaking such trips.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-people-are-traveling-to-dangerous-places
1064,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Some people claim that marketing and promotion plays a crucial role in improving the productivity of a company. I agree with this view.
However, I also believe that other factors such as the quality of the product and the competence of the staff are equally important.
To begin with, marketing and promotion helps ordinary people to become aware of the products offered by a company. Clever marketing tempts many people to buy products. As a result, the business grows gradually. Without enough marketing and promotion it is difficult for the enterprises to go into people’s minds and succeed. A good illustration of this is the growing number of adverts we see every day on television and on the internet. This clearly shows that it is important to give adequate importance to marketing and promotion.
However, other criteria such as the quality of a product or service also influence the success of a business. If the quality is cheap no one will purchase the product even with loads of advertisements or promotions. It can have negative effects on the reputation of the company. Furthermore, skilled and innovative employees are necessary to attain success for any organisation. A product will not exist in the market for very long without adequate innovations. Therefore, participation of hardworking and talented staff also contributes to the growth of a business.
To conclude, although it is true that marketing and promotion aids the development of a business, other factors such as the quality of the product and the skills of the employees are important too.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-marketing-and-promotion-are-crucial-to-the-success-of-a-business
1065,"At the present time, the population of some countries includes a relatively large no. of young adults compared with the no. of older people.","Many countries now have a large population of young people. While some people believe that this is advantageous, others are of the opinion that having the right mix of young and old people is essential for maintaining the proper balance. This essay will analyse both sides of the argument before arriving at a reasoned conclusion.
There are certainly several benefits to having more young people. To begin with, young people are more productive than old people. They are also healthier. As a result, industries have no difficulty finding the best talent. For instance, India has no scarcity of educated and skilled young people. Therefore, companies operating in the country are never short of talented people. Another advantage of having a large population of young people is their ability to bring about necessary changes in the thinking of the nation. It is a generally accepted that young people change their attitude as per the need and always challenge the old style of thinking. This helps the country to grow and gain acceptance on the global stage. Young people are also healthier and need less spending on healthcare.
That said, there are also some downsides to having more young people. Youngsters need jobs and if the country cannot generate enough employment opportunities for its young population, it can be a problem. India, for example, has a high unemployment rate because it has the highest number of individuals in the age bracket of 20-40 years. Joblessness can also lead to an increase in criminal activities.
To conclude, when we look at the positive changes young people can bring about in a society it is not hard to see that the advantages of having more young people outweigh the disadvantages.",7.5,band-8-5-essay-sample-there-are-more-young-people-than-old-people-in-many-countries
1066,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"With the advent of globalization, its merits and demerits have become a topic of intense debate. Many people reckon that globalization will result in loss of cultural identity while others believe that it will play pivotal role in maintaining global peace and harmony .In my opinion, globalization will definitely have some negative impact on local culture although it will have positive influence in restoring world peace.
To begin with, globalization leads to exposure of a society to multiple cultures making it vulnerable to cultural loss. As globalization spreads, it not only leads to economic growth of a country but also allows intermingling of different cultures. This sometimes make a society prone to be heavily influenced by other culture. For instance, due to development of tourism post globalization,Goa, the beach city of India registered a 20 percent decrease in celebration of local festivals as people are now more influenced by western culture .
However, globalization aids in maintaining global harmony as mutual business interest compel countries to keep peaceful relations. The economies of most of the countries are dependent on each other, therefore they try to resolve any clash with bilateral talks rather than resorting to war. Thus, it helps in building peaceful atmosphere across the world.
To conclude, I reiterate my opinion that globalization might have some deleterious impact on local culture, but the interdependence of economies due to business helps in avoiding tense situations because of mutual interests.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-globalization
1067,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Being able to be happy is one of the most crucial factors of life. Some people think that having enough money is the key of being happy; however, other people argue that too much money causes problems. In my opinion, the main element of being happy is directly related to money. This arguments is going to be proven by analyzing how good finance makes your life comfortable and stress free.
To begin with, having enough money in your life directly makes your living conditions excel. To illustrate, when people are able to afford their needs without difficulties, they become more content. It is clear that if people do not have to worry about payments of utilities or credit cards, they could live in comfort. Thus individuals who have adequate finance to support themselves are happier in their lives.
Another factor that makes having sufficient money important, is being able to live stress free. To illustrate, people who have enough income, do not have to work to earn their lives. In this way, they could easily spend more time on their hobbies or activities that make them happy. This makes if apparent that individuals who are busy with their hobbies, live life without stress. As a result if this, having enough money can be seen as an important factor that makes you happy.
To conclude, when all the points mentioned above are considered, I believe that having adequate amount of money makes people happy due to having comfortable and stress-free life. Should people want to be content in life, it is vital that they had better find enough financial income.",7.5,band-6-5-essay-sample-does-money-bring-happiness
1068,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"A company’s productivity mainly depends on the staff’s talents in different aspects. While some people think that when hiring people the company’s priority should be finding people who are creative and self-reliant, others argue that the skill to work in a team is more important. I believe both independence and teamwork are necessary skills for an employee.
To begin with, people who are innovative bring new ideas to their work and aid to the development of the institution they work in. Innovation is very crucial for the progress of the any organisation. A business group, for example, may not experience growth when they follow the same path for many years. An innovative and independent employee would be able to take decisions according to the situation and lead the company to success. Moreover, a person who is having many ideas tends to share his thoughts with the other colleagues and encourage them to be innovative.
On the other hand, according to some people, team work is more vital compared to the other skills. The reason behind this is that in their opinion, the employees have to complete their projects or tasks as a team. No one is actually taking individual decisions. In fact they are following instructions given by their managers. Sometimes individual decisions even cause clash among employees. Furthermore, they argue that in most cases, the freshly hired employees start as juniors. They do not immediately go to managerial positions that require them to make independent decisions. Majority of the decisions are taken by the senior staff. Therefore the quality of self reliance is irrelevant in most occasions.
To conclude, both the traits of independence and team work play different roles in the growth of the company. So in my opinion both these qualities are equally important for the success of an organisation.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-about-hiring-people-who-are-independent-and-innovative
1069,The following is an essay submitted by one of our readers.,"Technology has been a considerable part of our lives for ages. Especially, the aid it gives in the classroom is undeniable. I believe that conventional teachers will be removed from the classrooms and replaced by developed technology eventually. This argument is going to be proved by analyzing the fact that the amount of information technology can offer in the classroom and also being fast, adaptable and easy to access.
A very important contribution of technology to the classroom and the education system is the tremendous amount of information to offer in every aspect, specifically in the classroom environment. As an example, technological devices can connect and acquire any necessary information through internet any given time and place. Traditional teachers require to do more research to be able to answer any question directed to them. Thus, technology can easily take place of the ordinary teachers on the classroom.
Being adaptable, fast to response and easy to access are milestones of technology for students’ academic success. This is very apparent when any necessary information can be reached by technology very rapidly and without any struggle. Besides, adaptable teaching methods could be used easily by technological devices to target specific kind of students to be taught in an advanced way. For these kind of methods and quick responses, human teachers need to take formidable amount of training and they will be always reliant on technology. As a result if this, traditional teachers can be replaced by technological advancements.
When all the points mentioned above are considered, it is obvious that technology will take place of the conventional teachers because of the amount of information it provides and being adaptable, fast and easy to access. Should teachers want to stay in the race of the future of education system, they will have to offer something unparalleled to the education of young people.",7.5,band-6-5-essay-sample-technology-will-eventually-replace-teachers-in-the-classroom
1070,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Some employers or managers want their junior colleagues at their reach not only on working days but also on holidays. This trend brings several benefits to the people. However, it also has some drawbacks.
To begin with, some professions in the world demand the employers to be able to contact their staff even on holidays. For instance, medical or nursing professionals should always be ready to attend to the emergencies that occur in order to save people’s life regardless of holidays. In this case the main advantage is they could play an important role in saving lives. Another benefit of working on holidays for the employees is that they get paid for their work or overtime. It can contribute to monthly income of the workers. Furthermore, the company also benefits economically if the employee is ready to work without bothering about the holidays.
On the flip side, people find it difficult and tiring to work without adequate off days. There are several employees who do not want to receive even a single phone call from their employers when they are at home or on holiday because it makes them stressed out. Majority of the people do not want to be interrupted by their bosses because they want to get relaxed or refreshed on their holidays. Moreover, research indicates that people who work without getting enough rest often fail to concentrate on the task they are given the next day. It may affect the company’s productivity.
To conclude, even though both the employers and the employees benefit from getting their work done on holidays, it can have many negative sides. This may cause increased pressure and stress on the employees .So I believe the disadvantages are more obvious than advantages",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-some-employers-want-to-contact-their-employees-even-on-holidays
1071,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"The way news is disseminated to a viewer or a reader has dramatically changed over the last few decades. If in the previous century the major part of the information was a piece of text either printed in a newspaper or read by an announcer on TV, today it tends to be substituted by pictures or video. I agree with the view that the visual channel of receiving information is more effective.
Firstly, we receive most of the information through our eyes. For example, sometimes one good image can be better than tons of words. Scientists claim that a written text must be processed by the brain before it will be stored in our memory as a visual image. If we use pictures, we can skip this translation step and improve the data handling process.
Secondly, the amount of information consumed by an average person has drastically increased. For instance, if before it was just newspapers and radio, today TV, the Internet and social networks have added. Thus picking some piece of data from this enormous pool becomes very difficult. As it shows, the information with less complex structure, such as pictures, have more chances to be stored.
After analyzing how people handle data from the environment and the estimation of modern information flow volume, it is felt the argument for more effectiveness of pictures rather than words has been proved.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-news-stories-are-often-accompanied-by-images
1072,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"The invention of computer has changed the world and the way people live forever in a positive way. This essay agrees that the influence of computer on our daily lives stand as a favourable one. This essay will first discuss the speed and accuracy humans attained through computer in processing information and secondly, the entertainment quotient which computers added to our daily routine.
It is unarguably true that the fast and precise information processing, which is offered by computer, has enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness. In comparison to an era were documents and data were handled in physical form, computers made it possible to process information at a greater pace and higher accuracy, which in turn made the lives of millions more convenient and charismatic. Moreover, it helped to reduce the turn-around time which contributed to a better standard of living. For example, the Government departments of many countries are embracing computerised environment, which is helping people to get services like vehicle registration, tax payment etc. in an accurate and speedy way.
Computer is also providing immense pathways for entertainment. The multimedia options available in these machines made it possible for people to enjoy different forms of music, movies and games. Furthermore, the recreational opportunities it offer, created a different world which in turn helping people to reduce stress, tension and anxiety to a greater extend. For instance, the recent studies shows that games and music are the best ways to de-stress.
To sum up, the invention of computer is a blessing for human beings, as it helps to achieve faster and accurate data handling, which is extremely essential for the progress of any nation. Also it open up amusement avenues to people, which will provide a quality living.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-computers-have-changed-our-lives-for-good
1073,Influence of human beings on the world’s ecosystem is leading to the extinction of species and loss of bio-diversity. What are the primary causes of loss of bio-diversity?,"Each year numerous species of plants and animals are lost due to human activities. Deforestation and water pollution are the primary causes of the loss of biodiversity worldwide, and the most viable solutions to tackle this problem are to create protected areas on land and introduce strict regulations against water pollution.
The destruction of forests brings about different environmental problems, including the extinction of a variety of wildlife. Cutting down trees causes a lot of species to lose their habitats and condemns them to a certain death. For example, the ongoing deforestation of the Amazon rain forest has drastically reduced the great variety of animal and plant life it once had.
Another major issue with similar implications is water pollution caused by humans. Untreated industrial refuse is constantly dumped into water bodies, posing a great threat to marine ecosystems. In fact, toxic substances destroy the homes of millions of aquatic creatures, forcing them to seek refuge elsewhere. This is the case of sea turtles, which are now considered to be an endangered species.
Therefore, it is crucial that we effectively address these issues. Creating protected areas for animals who face extinction is one possible solution to protect forest biodiversity. In natural parks and reserves they will be nourished and protected from harmful activities.
As per marine pollution, governments could introduce laws and fines for industries that illegally dispose of their waste in the sea. Financial penalties will deter such harmful actions and indirectly help keep the environment of sea life clean and unspoiled. The Great Barrier Reef, for instance, is home to a wide range of creatures and is protected by strict laws and regulations.
To sum up, in order to preserve biodiversity of the forests and oceans, humans should protect natural habitats and abstain from wrongful actions.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-about-the-extinction-of-wildlife-species-due-to-human-activity
1074,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Many people complain that nowadays the educational system pays less attention to practical skills and favors theoretical knowledge instead. They argue that as a result, many graduates are finding it difficult to secure jobs. I don’t quite agree with this view. Actually I disagree with the argument that schools should shift their focus to practical skills development. In this essay, I will support my stand by analyzing the demands of the labor market as well as the relevance of acquiring skills.
The transition from industrial to the post-industrial society has reduced the number of professions that require hand labor. For instance, the job of a motorman used to be considered lucrative in the past. Now it is expected that all humans will be replaced by robots in the London Underground by 2020. This example proves that the modern world requires more intellectual workers who will be able to create new systems. Workers who can just operate those systems will be redundant in the near future. In other words, in this fast changing world, practical skills become outdated in a matter of years.
The other important point is the inertness of the educational system. For example, my friend’s wife studied typewriting in a college. She is now jobless because these machines have been displaced by computers. While it is true that she possesses a practical skill, it has no takers in the age of computers. Evidently, even after supplying students with cutting-edge practical skills nobody can guarantee they will be useful in the future. At the same time, giving them more theoretical knowledge might improve their employability.

As the above discussion has shown, the society should not insist that the educational focus should shift from theory to application. Only investment in deep fundamental knowledge can guarantee high and stable pace of development to the human kind.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-about-schools-and-colleges-giving-too-much-importance-to-theoretical-learning
1075,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"These days, serious crimes being committed are spiking in numbers annually. While some people are of the opinion that capital punishment is the best way to tackle the problem, the majority argue that other actions will be required. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in detail.
To begin with, some people maintain that execution is the most effective way to reduce these kind of crimes’ rates. They believe that applying justice on the criminals will reduce tensions in communities and will discourage other intended criminals from committing such crimes. For example, a recent study in the U.S. found that major crimes in states that apply capital punishment are far less than in the states which do not implement such a punishment. These people argue that capital punishment is the ultimate solution to combat major crimes.
On the other hand, most people maintain that there should be other rules to fight major crimes. They say that governments around the world should investigate the causes of the increasing rates of these types of crimes, such as increase purchase of guns, in order to address them properly. For instance, in 1980s, the Japanese government acknowledged that the easy possessing of firearms was the cause of the increased number of homicide, so after addressing the issue the rate of homicide has significantly decreased ever since. In their opinion, such measures are needed to solve the problems of increased rates of major crimes and as a result few people will lose their lives in such crimes.
In conclusion, the major crimes rates are skyrocketing nowadays. Although some of public believe that killing of the convicted criminals is the best way to tackle the problem, most of them maintain that other rules and actions can be taken to decrease the rates of these types of crimes. This essay discussed the various reasons why the public holds these points of view and weather capital punishment is effective or other rules needed.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-about-growing-crime-rates
1076,"Millions of people every year move to English-speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university.","During the last few decades, there has been an increase in the number of people preferring to study in countries where English is spoken. There are many reasons for this.
First, due to the overall development of these countries, the quality of education students receive here is higher compared to that in other countries. In addition, these countries have well developed economies, good quality of living and high salaries. Some international students who study in English speaking countries also receive an opportunity to find employment there. This is another factor that encourages students to pursue higher education there.
Another reason for international students to seek admission to universities in English speaking countries is that they already have a working knowledge of the language. English is taught in almost all countries. Even foreign students who are not fluent in English are able to use it for everyday purposes. When they study in an English speaking country, they also get an opportunity to perfect their language skills. There are also students who go to English speaking countries with the sole objective of acquiring greater level of proficiency in English.
English is the language of international communication. It opens more doors than any other language. Wherever you go, you will find at least a few people speaking English. This popularity of English is itself a good reason to learn it. If you are proficient in English, you have greater chances of finding a better job and a higher salary. In addition, someone who can speak and write English has access to almost all the content on the internet.
To conclude, there are several reasons for international students to want to study in English speaking countries.

1077,Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.,"These days, there are some jobs that are carried out by robots. However, I do not believe that all jobs will finally be performed by such a device for some reasons: the expense of their operation, their inabilities to do skilled jobs and governmental regulations.
To begin with, the cost of operating, maintaining and keeping them work continuously is extremely high. Because of this, many employers would prefer humans over robots. For example, the cost of installing a robot in a Khartoum-based supermarket was around one million U.S. dollars. Furthermore, these kinds of electronic devices need expertise to operate and to keep them working without a second pause which would increase that cost significantly. As a result, humans will be indispensible in the labour market.
In addition, there are many skilled jobs that need humans contact which is something that the robots can not do. For instance, medicine, engineering and social work areas. Consequently, such jobs will always be carried out by humans only. To add more, governments also would try to save the labour market because more people would be unemployed if employees are replaced by robots. A case in study, the staff of a supermarket were replaced by robots in Australia in 2011. As a result, more people will lose their jobs and that would negatively impact a society.
To sum up, I strongly think that the smart robots will never completely replace humans in the work fields. The high cost of their operation, their inability to perform skilled jobs and governments interventions are the reasons for the abovementioned argument.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-eventually-all-jobs-will-be-performed-by-robots
1078,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Inventions are a result of research which is aimed at improving the standard of life. They increase comfort and convenience. Some people argue that modern innovations have created more problems than solutions. However, I disagree with this argument. I believe it is about how people use technology. I will support my stand with examples in this essay.
Some people say that the nuclear bomb was the best example of the destructive power of science. They forget that the original intention of this research was to generate electricity from nuclear fusion. However, this technology was misused to develop nuclear bomb.
Another example of the negative effects of technology is pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Some people argue that ozone layer depletion and global warming are caused by pollution. They forget that eco-friendly alternatives like wind energy and solar energy are also the result of innovations and can be used to operate machines. It is the responsibility of people to use cleaner sources of energy instead of fossil fuels to protect climate.
A few people claim that computers and the internet are making the lifestyle of youth sedentary which is harmful in the long run. Today’s young people spend more time on social networking website than meeting friends and relatives in person. However, it is about discipline and usage which should be controlled by individuals. Inventions should not be held responsible for this.
Some people also argue that hacking, viruses, credit card scams etc., are also the result of modern innovations. In earlier days, these threats didn’t exist. However, it should be remembered that these problems can be prevented to a certain extent using the same technology.
To sum up, modern inventions are beneficial and make our lives safer, easier and more comfortable. It is up to the individuals to decide how they should use technology. Overuse and lack of control mechanisms are the main drivers of mishaps.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-modern-inventions-cause-more-problems-than-solutions

To what extend do you agree or disagree?","Climate change is the greatest threat to the existence of life on earth. Some people, however, argue that instead of preventing it we should find a way to live with it. I completely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce our impact on the climate of earth.
Global warming is the main cause of climate change. If both the people and the governments take appropriate actions, this can be controlled to a great extent. For example, the governments should stop the generation of power from fossil fuels which cause more carbon emissions and increase global warming. Governments can also invest in green energy sources like wind, solar and hydropower. Another practical solution that the government can implement is to impose ‘green taxes’ on industries and vehicles which emit carbon. Individuals should also try to reduce their carbon footprint by limiting the use of private vehicles and consuming energy responsibly.
Trying to live with climate change instead of preventing it is a dangerous idea because in the near future, climate change will make our planet inhabitable. Because of global warming polar ice is melting causing sea levels to rise. When the sea levels rise coastal cities will get submerged in water. Let us not forget the fact that almost all major cities in the world are extremely close to seas and oceans. Climate change also leads to various natural calamities like cyclones, flooding and drought.
To conclude, when there are so many ways to prevent climate change, I cannot agree with the argument that we should find a way to live with it.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Everyone wants to live in comfort. Some people find independent houses more convenient while others prefer modern-day apartments. I believe living in an apartment is more advantageous than living in a house for several reasons.
To start with, we are moving towards the culture of nuclear families where most adults work. Life is more stressful than ever and people have less time on hand. Given these circumstances, it is much easier to manage an apartment than an independent house. For instance, most apartments have housekeeping facilities that take care of all the cleaning and maintenance work, which we would have to manage ourselves if we live in a house.
Additionally, apartments are usually gated communities so they are a lot more secure. To exemplify, most apartments would have some sort of access cards for residents and stickers to identify their vehicles. Any visitors or guests will first have to go through the security, who will seek approval from the residents before allowing them inside. Overall, the security parameters are better than one can afford in a house. Furthermore, apartments have common facilities like recreational/play area for kids, swimming pools, sports, club houses and so on. One does not have to travel outside of their home to access these facilities. This results in a lot of time savings. Parents also feel it’s easier for them to allow their kids to play freely without any supervision.
However, living in an independent house does have its own advantages. They are certainly more spacious and owners can freely utilise and modify the space based on their convenience, which is hard to achieve in an apartment.
To conclude, apartments and houses have their set of pros and cons. However, I believe that apartments satisfy the needs of our modern lifestyle better than independent houses.",7.5,band-8-5-essay-sample-apartments-are-better-than-houses
1081,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Some people think that rich countries should support poor countries by providing adequate food and education, while others argue it is the government’s task to look after its citizens. In my view, wealthy nations should support the poor only if there is a scarcity of natural resources in the country.
There is no doubt that the government is responsible for the well-being of its citizens. In democratic countries, the government is elected by its people so it is the responsibility of the government to improve the quality of life for the people. The government should define long term plans to improve the welfare of the citizens and provide high standard of education for the people. It should identify and use the natural resources to improve the economy of the country. Lack of planning will result in poor education and low standard of living.
On the other hand, due to inadequate natural resources, some countries are unable to raise the standards on their own. Countries like Somalia are affected by severe droughts and water scarcity which make it difficult for people to lead normal lives.
In these cases wealthy nations should come forward to improve the quality of life. Without their help, the government is unable to meet the basic needs of its people. They are unable to design the long term plan because of lack of funds and scarcity of natural resources.
To conclude, rich countries should help the poorer nations only if the later do not have abundant natural resources to support their people. If they have good local resources then it should be the concerned government’s responsibility to improve the standard of living for its citizens.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-should-wealthy-nations-share-their-wealth-among-poor-nations
1082,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"This is an era of globalization and international branding is popular throughout the globe. Some skeptics see it as a threat to their country where as others consider it as an essential development for the nation.  In my opinion, international marketing is indeed a cheaper option to bring innovation in every aspect. In this essay, I shall underpin my aforementioned statement with relevant examples and ideas.
To begin with, non native companies bring wide range of opportunities for indigenous society. Natives learn various skills and marketing strategies from outsiders and then implement those ideas in their own country. For example, online shopping was not common in India but the USA based company Amazon made it popular here. This also led to the birth of several India based companies such as Flipkart and Snapdeal. Now Indian markets are flooded with a huge number of online shops.
Besides this, International marketing is spreading diverse culture in the region and it is beneficial for natives. For instance, due to the establishment of various USA based organizations in India the 5-day work week is gaining popularity in the country. These days working hours for offices are 9 to 5 along and Saturdays and Sundays are holidays. This work schedule was not followed earlier in the country. Workers are more comfortable with this change hence they are adapting and welcoming it with open hands.
To conclude, international marketing is a positive development for any nation. No doubt, the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages. Therefore in my view it will flourish more in the near future and surge in popularity.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-about-the-positive-and-negative-aspects-of-international-marketing

Children often find it difficult to follow what they have been instructed to do. Parents tell kids what should be done or should not be done. It is for their benefits, but they don’t quite get it. On the other hand they copy their elder brother or sister instinctively. For example, in childhood days, my younger brother always used to copy me. If I used to play video game, he also wanted to do the same. If I read comics, he also demanded the same.  It is evident that children are keen observers and they tend to pick up things faster by copying than by following instructions.
They also learn bad habits from elders. When they are young, they do not know what is good or bad. Once they grow up, then they realize these. For example, children see their cousins and siblings insisting for toys and then getting it from parents. They start believing that it is good to be adamant to get what you want. They are unable to understand how parents have to sacrifice other things to fulfill their wish. I believe it is the responsibility of parents to explain such things to children. It will ensure that children develop only good habits.
On the contrary, some people believe that every child has a unique talent. According to them children learns as per their interest and abilities and not by surroundings. However, I believe that a child is like clay and get moulded by their surroundings.  right environment is much more important to harness its talent.
To sum up, children follow what they see rather than what they are told to do. It is the responsibility of parents and elders to lead them in the right direction by setting examples.  Rather than by rule book, it is better to lead them by example.

In my opinion, visual media does have a lasting impact on the audience; however, the use of words to describe the news stories cannot be underplayed.","However, the importance of words cannot be neglected because photos can excite the viewers for only a short span of time and it is the actual story that keeps the audience interested till the end. It has also been observed that some people are sensitive to pictures of news involving crime and violence.

1085,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Many nations are witnessing a drastic rise in crime rates. I think this is attributable to multiple reasons such as lack of education, unemployment, an inefficient judicial system, to name a few.
Firstly, education plays a crucial role in shaping an individual’s character. It is education that makes us capable of differentiating right and wrong early in our childhood. Lack of basic education is one amongst the primary causes for increasing crimes. For example, in my country India, a vast majority of population is illiterate. This has a deleterious impact on the society as a whole because people turn to crime without any thought, they cannot comprehend what’s right and wrong. To deal with this issue, primary education should be made available to everyone without any fees and government should take serious measures to make this mandatory for everybody.
Furthermore, the other main cause of the spike in crime rates is unemployment. As it is rightly said ” An empty mind is a devil’s workshop.” When people cannot find work, they have all the free time in the world. They think of crime as a shortcut to obtaining and possessing the riches of life, without any hard work. To tackle this problem, authorities should focus on increasing jobs and also introducing some compensation for unemployed people. In lieu of such compensation, they should be made to do social and community work.
In addition, an inefficient judicial system is equally to be blamed. Failing to punish the criminals in time is yet another reason why people are not afraid of committing crime. To exemplify, India reported the most cruel and inhuman gang rape case a few years ago. It got global attention, there was mass protest, people demanded immediate justice. In spite of such a movement, it took over three years to come out with a judgement and yet the criminals have still not been executed. In such cases, it is the slow and laid-back judicial system which is responsible for many rape cases being reported every single day. I think, if the government imposes severe implications on violating laws, crime rates will definitely see a rapid fall.
To conclude, there is a urgent need for the governments to focus on addressing illiteracy and unemployment problems, which attribute to the rise of crime rates. At the same time it demands for strengthening the judicial system so people fear the repercussions of committing a crime.

1086,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Some people have a perspective that advertisements lure us to purchase goods that are not of necessity. But, others are of the view that advertising enlightens us of new items which might ameliorate our lives. I strongly agree that ads motivate consumers to buy unwanted things. In this essay, I will discuss both of these viewpoints.
There are compelling reasons why advertisements encourage people to own unneeded items. First of all, multinational corporations create meticulously crafted ads to entice consumers to purchase their products. For instance, fast food chain McDonald’s advertising artifacts tries to lure children with toys and playrooms in order to sell kid’s meal. Moreover, vigorous advertisement campaigns are promoted across plethora of channels such as TV, billboards, online and so on to gauze consumer attention to purchase goods that may be of no need to them. Consequently, people become more materialistic as advertising compounds their desire to own more items.
However, there are some merits of ads. The primary advantage to consumers is the awareness of new products. Informative advertisements can benefit people in their daily lives. For example, campaigns of medicinal fluid to remove minuscule warts can greatly help people with removing dead skin cells from their body. Furthermore, advertising of same kind of product from multiple vendors or manufacturers influence competitive pricing in the marketplace and thus greatly benefits us. For instance, toothpaste advertisements of Colgate, Crest or other brands provides one with varying options to choose from. Therefore, ad campaigns can enlighten consumers.
To conclude, I firmly believe that advertising lures us to buy unwanted items through meticulously crafted ads and an influx of campaigns across various channels. On the bright side, advertisements can be informative and influence pricing of goods.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-ads-encourage-people-to-buy-things-they-dont-want
1087,The following is an essay submitted by one of our users.,"Access to information has increased significantly these days and traditional ways seem to have taken a back seat. However, I believe that there are lots of people who still like to read books, newspaper etc. to gain knowledge. Therefore, I disagree with the argument that libraries are no longer needed. Well-structured information can be gained without distraction in libraries. Also, they are accessible to almost everyone.
First and foremost, libraries are well organized with dedicated sections. Books, journals and magazines are organized in various sections like arts, science, history, architecture and so on. This organization allows users to find information easily. Second, books are published by reputed authors and are well reviewed by editors. Particularly, books contain information in a sequence which is rare in articles found on web. Third, a library is a peaceful and quiet place with little distraction. This allows a focussed effort to learn or research. On the contrary, web has many distractions in the form of chatting, videos, emails etc.
Fourth, old generation finds it difficult to use computers; they still read newspapers rather than websites for news. In India, there are still many people who do not have access to computer or are computer illiterate. Not only that, having a phone, tablet or computer with internet is a cost which still many do not wish to afford. They are still continuing with traditional methods.
To sum up, libraries offer authentic information in a well-structured manner which is difficult to find online. Also, without distractions, people can read and learn more in libraries than on the web. Hence, in my opinion, libraries are still needed and will continue to be here in the future as well.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-libraries-are-no-longer-needed
1088,"Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.","There are varying views among people about the duties of a government. It is argued that economic growth should be a government’s utmost priority, whilst others believe that other types of improvement are equally valuable. This essay agrees that other categories of development are equally important to economic growth.
Firstly, economic development means a better standard of living for the people. The government can have the spending prowess to improve its services to the people like healthcare, education and transportation. Furthermore, it attracts foreign investors to finance businesses and thus it generates employment opportunities to people. For example, government agencies will be able to build more educational institutions allowing their people to have the necessary skills to land a job. This in return will give a nation enough workforce to support upcoming businesses from international corporations.
On the other hand, relying solely on economic growth as a measuring stick of a nation’s progress can be deceiving. This is because a country may increase their gross domestic capacity but at the same the inflation rate could be increasing. The gap between rich and poor are already widening. Therefore, a county’s leaders must also focus on other attributes of development like social justice, gender equality and human rights. This will allow marginalised people in the society to feel treated fairly by the government. For instance, in China, considered an economic powerhouse second to the US, they have a dissatisfaction rating of around 58% among their people. This is largely due to the widening of social classes and human rights violations present in their country.
Overall, government leaders should listen to their people and adjust to their needs. Cooperation of both authorities and its people may address conflicting views on what should be the important objective of a government. I believe that economic prosperity as well as other areas of development should be balanced uniformly in terms of government priority.",7.5,band-6-5-essay-sample-about-the-goals-of-a-government
1089,The following is an essay submitted by one of our readers.,"People have different views about the way to achieve a successful career. While trying out different jobs can give better chances to find the perfect position, I believe that having a defined career direction at an early stage tend to lead to greater results.
On the one hand, I think settling down early can be extremely beneficial to one’s career. Firstly, by doing that, you can build up working experiences at a young age and quickly become an expert in your own field. It is a big advantage for your career in the long run which could help achieve higher up positions in the organization. For example, most NGOs require at least 5 to 7 years of relevant working experiences for their manager roles. Secondly, by staying at a company for a long time, workers can establish a large network that could be helpful to their jobs. Finally, the early adaptation to the working environment and company culture can maximize their skills and potentials and help achieve their goals at a speedy time.
However, some people have their own reasons to change jobs frequently. Nowadays, it is not an early task for young workers to find a suitable job. Recent research shows that 70% of fresh graduates in Vietnam do not work in their professions, therefore, they keep seeking for new opportunities. In addition, the most important factor of a long-running career is job satisfaction. Instead of sticking to a job that you start to lose interest in, taking up different roles can be joyful experiences that make you realize where you truly belong to.
In conclusion, pursuing a successful career, in my opinion, is a long and winding road that requires a clear direction, patience and the confidence to make changes when needed.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-changing-jobs-frequently-is-bad
1090,The following is an essay submitted by one of our readers.,"It is believed that social status and the amount of material goods that a person owns are crucial elements determining his value, whereas the importance of morals such as honor, kindness and trust has faded away. This essay completely agrees with this statement and it will elaborate on the reasons below.
Firstly, people belonging to high social status and having a significant number of material possessions are regarded as powerful and admirable by the vast majority of people. This is because, in the present time, being wealthy is directly associated with happiness and success, which are considered universal goals by the general population. For instance, passengers who fly in business class are exceptionally and exclusively treated by the crew, compared to those who fly in economy class, which perfectly illustrates how people are viewed in relation to their wealth.
Secondly, moral values are not currently appreciated as much as they were in the past, because they are not considered essential features of success. Nowadays, following convictions such as honor, kindness and trust is not proven to provide any benefit but personal satisfaction, which is less important to most individuals. For example, all the opportunities that I have today are because of my income and not my character.
In conclusion, social status and owning material goods have a greater impact on how a person´s worth is judged than being loyal, kind and trustworthy. I totally agree with this view because in the current society, success and power are associated with being wealthy; however, having moral values do not seem to provide real benefits other than personal satisfaction",7.5,band-6-5-essay-sample-a-persons-worth-and-material-possessions
1091,"Some people think its ok to benefit from animals, while others think they should not be exploited. Discuss both sides and give your opinion","There is no doubt that, animals are very important part of our ecosystem. Few people believethat it is natural to use animals for one’s own benefit, while others argue that it’s a form of abuse. In this essay, I will discuss points on both sides of the argument and provide my support to the former view.
From times immemorial, human beings have been depending on animals. There is no doubt that we derive great benefit from animal products like milk, medicines, nutritious food. Not only in terms products, but also animals are widely used for transportation and agriculture. I think it is impossible to imagine our lives without the need to depend on animals. For instance, there is no true supplement for animal milk in terms of nutritional value and same goes for drugs that use animal products. As mentioned earlier, they form an important part of our ecosystem, and to me our ecosystems are designed in a way living beings benefit from one another and co-exist in harmony. Now that we have looked into why it is impossible for us to imagine life without benefiting from animals, let’s now switch to the other side of our argument.
In contrast, there are few people who are of the opinion that humans should refrain from exploiting animals. In my view, that’s true to an extent, humans should not hunt or kill animals for pleasure; also they should not mistreat animals by creating a hostile living environment for them. These actions, in long term will harm mankind, because these animals that are being killed for pleasure become extinct which will in turn result in unbalanced ecosystem that’s dangerous. It is important for humans to note that they cannot exist without deriving benefits from animals, and it is there responsibility to ensure animal welfare.
In conclusion, it is evident that humans cannot exist without deriving benefits from animals therefore I support the concept of depending on animals for our benefit, but as discussed earlier this needs to be carried out without subjecting animals to exploitation.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-is-it-fair-to-use-animals-for-our-benefits

Keep in mind that all band score estimates are approximate.,"There is no doubt that parents play a crucial role in the all round development of their children. A few people tend to encourage the concept of parents going through a mandatory formal training on parenting. I completely disagree with that view point. In this essay, I will support my opinion with relevant examples.
I think every parent tend to develop their own unique way when comes to raising their children. This exclusivity/ uniqueness in parenting make it an art that cannot be completely taught through formal education. For instance, values that are taught during childhood are unique to a particular family or society; there is no way to generalize values. For example, my parents always considered non-vegetarian meal as forbidden for human consumption and always encouraged me to a vegetarian. This may not be the case with every parent or every family. Though formal education may teach you values, they may not always be tailor-made to suite your interest’s.
Furthermore, I believe that the best way to learn to raise children is through experience; this experience can be just by observing people in your inner circle like close friends or relatives or it can just be learning through your own experience on how you have been raised.For example, my parents always encouraged me to be adamant and outspoken, as they believed that these traits will make be bold and mentally strong. These traits are seldom taught through education they are lessons people learn through experience.
To sum up, I think parenting is best taught through experiential learning rather than through formal education. I am of a strong opinion that parenting is unique to a particular culture, family and living conditions and all these are not taught through formally taught. Therefore, parenting cannot be effectively taught through formal education.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample

Keep in mind that all band score estimates are approximate.,"There is no doubt that the secret of health is following a healthy lifestyle. Some people believe that it is government’s responsibility to ensure that their citizens stay healthy, while others argue that it is the responsibility of concerned individual. In this essay, we will look into both sides of the argument and provide my support to the latter view.
First and foremost, there is no doubt that government play’s a critical role to ensure well being of there citizens. It is always beneficial if government can support and motivate individuals to pursue healthy life style. This can be done in several different ways like organizing health camps, subsidizing healthy food, imposing heavy taxes on un healthy food etc. For instance, in countries like Sweden government offers free health camps to educate people on healthy lifestyle, they also offer subsidy healthy food to encourage citizens. Recently, a third party survey indicated that these initiatives have reduced the number of cases for heart attacks, obesity in Sweden. Considering these points, we can see why people think it’s essential for governments to play and active role to ensure healthy lifestyle for their citizens.
But, a strong argument can be made on the other side. In my view, individuals should be made responsible and accountable for their health. The onus of following a healthy life style should be his/her responsibility. For instance, there are individuals who don’t consider healthy life style as there priority and don’t even appreciate the fact that following a healthy life style makes them feel better. In all these cases, the initiatives from governments will either be ineffective or bear very less effect.
In conclusion, the responsibility of following a healthy life style should rest on individuals, while governments should support and motivate them to do so.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-the-government-should-ensure-that-people-stay-healthy

Keep in mind that all band score estimates are approximate.,"It’s a well known fact that educational institutions such as schools lay equal importance in teaching subjects like history , which may not have any effect on students’ future professional career. Though some people think that schools should concentrate more on teaching subjects like science , math etc.,I completely disagree with them . In this essay, I will support my opinion with relevant examples.
First, it’s undeniably true that schools play a critical role in all-round development of students. In my view, subjects like history will not only impart knowledge about different cultures but also will introduce them to several ancient civilizations. This knowledge, will help them embrace different cultures, and appreciate ancient civilizations. Learning about history , people and cultures of different countries may motivate them to explore these diverse cultures during later part of their lives . For instance, my friend who recently visited India, always had a strong liking towards Indian history and culture right from his school days which in turn persuaded him to visit and explore India.
Second, subjects like history have multiple facets to them, they teach history of leadership, history on ground breaking research, history about highly successful people etc. All these are critical to motivate students to be successful in future. Furthermore, In my view its essential to have a knowledge of the past to be successful in future, and subjects like history make that possible.It is important to note that Science and Math help to hone skill sets that are entirely different from the skill sets that you gain though reading history. To me, a well –rounded individual should possess all these skill sets.
In conclusion,based on the fact that learning about cultures, civilizations etc., is equally important for students. I firmly believe that schools should spend equal and attention towards teaching subjects like history .

1095,"Nowadays, more and more older people who need employment compete with the younger people for the same jobs. What problems this causes? What are solutions?","Seniors are now competing with youngsters for the same jobs. This creates tough competition in the job market. Unemployment rates are already high in some countries. And when youngsters have to share the available jobs with seniors, it creates more unemployment among them.
The fact that many seniors still need jobs clearly shows that their financial situation is not good. This is a cause for concern. Seniors who don’t have enough savings for their twilight years are a social liability. If they don’t manage to find employment and earn enough, the government will have to take care of their healthcare costs. What’s more, finding jobs is not easy for senior adults. Many of them lack the skills needed for the modern workplace. That said, there are still some jobs for which companies prefer seniors to juniors. Even if they are not as tech savvy as youngsters, they have more experience. Also they are able to think with a level head. Because of these traits many companies still appoint senior adults.
Seniors actively looking for employment is not exactly great news for young people. While it is true that they can learn a lot from the experience of older employees, there aren’t enough jobs for all in the market. The truth is that young people who often have a dependent spouse and young children need employment more than seniors.
There are some solutions to this problem. Enforcing a strict retirement age will prevent seniors from looking for jobs. However, that will affect older people who are in desperate need of a job. To help them, the government needs to launch some welfare schemes and ensure that all the people who need assistance can have it.
To conclude, when seniors compete with juniors for the same jobs, the unemployment situation only gets worse. The government can prevent this from happening by launching welfare programs for the elderly.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-seniors-and-youngsters-are-competing-for-the-same-jobs
1096,Space exploration is much too expensive and money should be spent on more important things.,"Thanks to our curiosity and technological advancements, we have achieved tremendous progress in space research. Some people feel that since space exploration is too expensive, we should abandon it and instead spend that money on other things. I don’t quite agree with this view. I admit that space research is expensive but in my opinion, the benefits are worth the money.
To start with, there are several mysteries about space. If we can solve even some of them, that will be a tremendous achievement for us. It could even make our planet safer. We are already using satellites to forecast weather. Weather predictions have saved countless lives from natural disasters like storms and floods.
Our planet is just one of the millions of planets in space and it has already become a crowded place. If we can find other habitable planets, that will solve the burning issue of overpopulation on earth. Scientists are already exploring the possibility of sending people to Mars. If we can colonize Mars, it will be the biggest achievement in the history of human race.
Alien life is another thing that interests ordinary people and scientists alike. There are numerous films on this subject. While it is true that we still have no conclusive evidence of aliens, learning more about them will definitely help us to stay better prepared against possible attacks from them.
To conclude, our planet is nothing more than a speck in the vast universe. By learning more and more about space, we can better understand our position in the universe and also stay safe from potential threats. Therefore, I don’t agree with the argument that money should be spent on other areas because space research is too expensive.",7.5,ielts-essay-about-space-exploration

Possession of Nuclear Weapons have created fear between countries leaving conflicts unresolved, moreover nuclear power is turned out to serve energy need economically and in environmental friendly way. However, drawbacks f nuclear technology can not be overseen which are hazardous disasters if it is misused. In my opinion, even though nuclear technology has brought plenty of advantages but cons of its usage holds more weightage.
On the one hand, invention of nuclear technology has blessed mankind by providing affordable energy. Consequently, it helps to meet their power demand and foster the development of economy. Additionally, development of nuclear weapons has created threat between first world countries from each other and forcing them to resolve their conflicts by debate. As a result, there is little of no worry about arising situations like world war. Hence, it is palpable that nuclear energy has capability to flourish economy and make a world a better place to live.
On the another hand, It is not wise to gloss over the perilous effects of nuclear disasters. Nowadays, terrorism is increasing at alarming rate and use of nuclear weapons by such anti humanitarian activity could be fatal.  Moreover, such disasters could even occur in the process of generating nuclear power and testing nuclear weapons and effect society severally leading to deformities in many generations. For example, historical attack on Japan in World war II by nuclear missile had its effects for several decades. Therefore, nuclear technology has several negative repercussions on society.
Finally, although development of nuclear technology has brought several benefits for mankind but it can not be accepted unless it becomes completely safe for mankind. It cannot be accepted as beneficial technology until there are some activists around the world who gravitate towards its use to create terror in the world.
In conclusion, I believe from points above that disadvantages arising from misuse of nuclear technology as well as horrendous tragedy from nuclear disaster can overshadow all possible benefits.

With the increasing standard of living across the world, many claim that people are more materialistic these days.  These claims are more specifically targeted at the younger generation.  Children are seen as not been taught to save, but only to spend.  There may be some truth in this, but I do not agree with it completely.
First, let us look at the viewpoint of those who think that children these days only know how to spend.  It is true that many children are spoilt since a young age.  With the increasing financial status of young families, parents nowadays rents are busy-working professionals, some of them tend to only provide their children with money, but not teach them to manage it.  This leads to children not understanding the value of money, and overspending it.
However, claiming that children only learn how to spend money, is over-generalising.  Many families these days still do instil the value of money to children since a young age.  Various programmes through schools, media, and the government are available to teach children budgeting and wise spending.  Besides that, students nowadays are encouraged to take up part time jobs.  By earning money, they actually learn the value of money, and are indirectly taught to save.
I do agree that more children these days are able to overspend, but I believe that it is not because they were not taught to save.  The main reason to this is the increasing standard of living, which creates a culture of materialism.  I believe that with the right methods of teaching, children will learn to value money more as they grow up.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-about-children-spending-money-instead-of-saving-it

These days, we see an increasing number of children carrying mobile phones. These gadgets that were once a luxury for teenagers are becoming a necessity for younger children. One reason to this is the affordability of mobile phones these days. A more significant reason is the concern of parents over the danger and complexity of the modern world.
Mobile phones were designed to improve and break the limitations of communication. As population, traffic, and various complexities in society increases, there are concerns over safety of children. This is credited to the difficulty of communication between children and parents. Gone were the days where children could travel freely without worrying their parents. As a result, parents resort to giving their children mobile phones. This puts their mind at ease knowing that their children will be contactable in any case of emergency.
However, there are people questioning the effectiveness of mobile phones on curbing danger. Schools are generally safe for children and have payphones available when urgent communication is needed. Furthermore, allowing children to carry expensive gadgets might in fact make them vulnerable to danger. Some parents might also take the ease of communication for granted by allowing their children too much freedom. Young children are not supposed to be allowed to travel without the supervision of adults, be it teachers or parents. Giving them a mobile phone does not make them more protected.
To sum up, I do see the benefits of giving children mobile phones, but I do not agree that it is an absolute necessity. The focus should be on raising safety awareness among children through education. They should also be provided with sufficient protection and supervision. This are direct methods that should be taken to create a safe environment for children, instead of over-reliance on mobile phones.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-about-mobile-phones-and-young-children

Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.","The crime rate in any society has a strong association with the number of guns possessed by its people. If more people possess guns, obviously the crime rate will also increase. Advocates of gun ownership might disagree, but in my opinion, gun control will make a society safer.
Supporters of widespread gun use argue that having guns at one’s disposal will enhance one’s safety. Also, in their opinion, gun ownership is an important civil right. They argue that tackling crime by banning guns is not possible because criminals carry them around all the time. In such a scenario, if ordinary people do not have access to guns, they might be at a loss. This argument might sound logical but it is not because strict gun laws will make them inaccessible to criminals as well. Some of them also argue that ban on gun ownership will prevent sportsmen and hunters from practicing their hobbies. However, in my opinion, none of these are valid reasons to permit the widespread of guns.
In any community, saving lives should be the first priority. Since guns pose a major threat to people’s lives, they must be banned. Mass shooting massacres have occurred several times in the US, a country where just about anyone can own guns. These massacres were an obvious example of the hazardous ramifications of unwise gun laws. Some reports have also shown that domestic crimes decline dramatically when guns are inaccessible. Many crimes are committed in the heat of the moment. When the offender can’t find the gun easily, they might get time to cool down and a helpless life could be saved.
To sum up, despite the calls for widespread use of guns, in my opinion, strict gun laws will make the society safer by keeping firearms out of reach of both criminals and law-abiding citizens.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-about-shootouts-and-liberal-gun-laws

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"People hold different views about how taxpayers’ money should be spent. Some believe that it should be spent on healthcare. Others, however, disagree and argue that there are other pressing needs. In my opinion, the government should spend taxes on all areas that are crucial to the development of a nation. This includes healthcare, education, infrastructure and research and development.
I totally agree with the argument that tax money should be spent on healthcare. However, I don’t think that the whole of it should be spent on this sector. Today people are suffering from a variety of illnesses. While treatments are available, they are often very expensive. By increasing its spending on healthcare services and providing free vaccines and treatments, the government can save many lives.
Other sectors like education and infrastructure are also equally important. Illiteracy is one of the main causes of poverty. A nation cannot progress without education. Since many parents still do not have the means to send their children to schools and colleges, the government should make education free for those living below the poverty line.
Infrastructure is another sector that requires huge amounts of government investment. A nation needs a vast network of roads, railways, bridges and transport systems for development. People and goods should be able to move freely from place to place. The government uses tax payers’ money to fund its projects. Not only healthcare but other sectors also need a boost in the form of government funding.

However, one should not forget that whatever that is available today is actually a progressive evolution of what was sowed in the past. To delineate with an example, the present day computers are an extension of the microprocessor chips invented half a century ago and microprocessors were invented to overcome the difficulties in maintaining too many ledgers which existed since the 18th century. This analogy applies to all facilities enjoyed by the current generations. Moreover, there will always be a void in knowledge until someone unleashes it, which later on becomes a stepping stone for several sensational inventions and discoveries.
To conclude, in my view, it is unfair to compare modern world’s achievements to yester years’ achievements. Without the inventions and discoveries of yesterday, we wouldn’t be where we are today.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-our-achievements-are-bigger-than-those-of-ancient-cultures
1103,"Climate change is a big environmental problem that has become critical in the last couple of decades. Some people claim that humans should stop burning fossil fuels and use only alternative energy resources, such as wind and solar power. Others say that oil, gas and coal are essential for many industries, and not using them will lead to economic collapse. What is your opinion?","Climatic variations due to the excessive use of fossil fuels have become a major environment problem. Some people, therefore, feel that we should terminate the burning of fossil fuels and instead switch to renewable resources like wind and solar energy. However, others feel that we cannot stop the use of fossil fuels because they are required for many industries. I don’t quite agree with this view. In my opinion, it is possible for alternative energy sources to replace conventional sources like coal and petroleum.
Since most of the industries require fossil fuels, huge amounts of them are extracted from earth through mining. This creates several problems like earthquakes. Excessive mining upsets the structure of the earth and leads to several natural disasters. Mining in oceans affect aquatic life and may also lead to tsunamis that will wreak havoc in coastal areas. What’s more, when fossil fuels are burnt, they release dangerous gases into the atmosphere and cause serious air pollution.
It is true that our industries depend on fossil fuels. If their mining is stopped, it will cause economies to collapse. The only way to prevent this is to promote the uses of alternative sources. The problem with alternative sources is that they are still not available for wide scale use. For example, wind and solar energies, maybe greener but they are still more expensive. If we want to prevent the burning of fossil fuels, we need to develop technologies that will help us to harness the power of solar energy at a cheaper rate.
To conclude, the burning of fossil fuels have several negative consequences and should be stopped. However, this will not be possible without improving the technologies available for harnessing alternative sources.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-about-climate-change
1104,More and more people are moving to urban areas? What are the consequences of this?,"Overpopulation in cities and towns causes two major problems. The most important one is traffic congestion which is a direct consequence of the rise in urban population. In my country, drivers spend approximately one hour to travel ten kilometers in peak hours. This is really alarming as countless hours are being lost every week in traffic jams. Another major issue is pollution. In fact, pollution can have disastrous effects on people’s health and can lead to life-threatening diseases.
Fortunately, solutions are available to tackle this problem. Governments should provide job opportunities in the countryside in order to discourage job seekers from moving to big cities. This had shown to be effective in Nordic countries where overpopulation related problems were reduced by applying this solution. Governments should also improve the public transport network by making it more reliable with the objective of encouraging more people to take it. Individuals should contribute their bit too. They should make a conscious effort to switch to eco-friendly transport solutions like hybrid cars and use them only when necessary. If we can reduce the number of vehicles on the roads, there will be a remarkable improvement in air quality.
To conclude, although overpopulation in big cities has far reaching consequences, both governments and individuals can combat them effectively by making a concerted effort. Since pollution can grow in the coming years, they need to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-consequences-of-overpopulation-in-urban-areas
1105,In many countries schools have severe problems with student behaviour. What do you think are the causes of this?,"Teachers play an important role in the proper development of children. Since they want their students to grow into responsible and successful adults, they are often strict with them. Unfortunately, this creates a lot of problems between children and teachers. Children, especially teens, do not like it when their teachers rebuke or punish them. This frustration with the teachers and the unsympathetic environment at school often manifests itself as misbehavior in the class.
In many schools, the relation between students and teachers has soured over the years. Teaching has become just another profession today. Earlier teachers used to treat their students as their own children. Now many schools are only interested in getting excellent results. They push their students hard to achieve higher grades. Teachers, too, are losing their commitment to their job. Many of them are now only concerned about their salaries and have a tough time winning the love and respect of their students.
Students tend to misbehave in the class when the teacher is not ‘popular’ with them. This will encourage the teacher to take stringent punitive measures which in turn will further sour the relationship between the teacher and the student.
Misbehaviour in the class or the school is almost always an indication that something is wrong with the child. They may be facing problems at home or they may have trouble getting on in the class. In either case, a teacher who probes into their mind will be able to find the problems and suggest solutions. Unfortunately, very few teachers have this kind of interest in their students today. However, they cannot be blamed for this. The school syllabus is becoming fatter and fatter. Teachers are already struggling to complete their portions before exams so they have little time to offer counseling to the students.
To conclude, student misbehaviour is almost always an indication that they are not happy with the treatment they receive from teachers and school authorities. Instead of resorting to punitive actions, the schools and teachers should make a sincere effort to find out the underlying causes that encourage students to misbehave. Once these problems are addressed many students will start behaving normally.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-why-do-children-misbehave-in-the-class
1106,Some students take a year off between school and university to work and travel. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"These days many students who have completed their high school take one or two years off before starting university. They either work or travel during this time. In my opinion, this arrangement has both advantages and disadvantages.
When students take years off after finishing school, their attention shifts to other areas. Some might travel and some might work. While traveling is exciting and helps them learn more about other countries or people, it does not do much to improve their career prospects. And those who take up a job immediately after finishing school will most probably have to work in the unskilled sector. Since these jobs are more likely to earn them some money and make them financially independent, they might just stick to them. Unfortunately, this will not help in the long term because unskilled workers will have to be content with low salaries and benefits.
However, those students who eventually return to their studies after taking a year’s gap will benefit if they can focus on their studies. The valuable work experience they gained or the lessons they learned from their travels will improve their career prospects. And when they are ready to start work after finishing university, they will have employers queuing up to hire them. Unfortunately, many of these students who take time off after school will never join university. Those who join a university may find it difficult to focus on their studies. Many of them will drop out and return to their previous job.
To conclude, taking a year off has both benefits and drawbacks. Traveling around the world or taking up a job has several benefits. Travel, for example, will enhance one’s horizons and improve one’s perspectives on life. In the same way, part time or full time jobs equip students with valuable skills that will stand them in good stead. However, a university education is still required to find a good job and students who do not start university after taking a year off will only hamper their career prospects.",7.5,some-students-take-a-year-off-between-school-and-university-ielts-essay-sample
1107,Nowadays more and more children acquire unhealthy eating habits. Why is it happening? What can be done to solve this issue?,"We now live in a career centric world. Everyone wants to be a super achiever. In many families both parents work. While there are some advantages to this arrangement, it has several disadvantages as well. When dad and mom work, neither will have time to cook proper meals for their children. Since fast foods eliminate the need to cook, they simply grab packets of them from the supermarket shelves. They don’t understand the health consequences of their action.
Fast food giants are spending millions of dollars on advertising and marketing. Many of these ads specifically target children. Their ads present their foods as healthy and delicious. Neither the parents nor the children see the real picture.
There are solutions to this problem. The first one, of course, is to cook delicious and healthy food at home. If this is not possible because of time constraints, parents should consider hiring a domestic help to take care of cooking. The government should also formulate laws that prevent fast food giants from airing their ads on channels meant for children. If kids do not see the ads of these products, they are unlikely to want them.
To conclude, it is necessary to protect our kids from health problems. This will not be possible if parents, the government and food companies do not make a concerted effort.

1109,Nowadays more and more young people hold important positions in the government. Some people think that is a good thing while others argue that it is not beneficial. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is true that the number of young people who hold highly responsible positions in the government is on the rise.
Some people believe that it is not beneficial to the progress of the country; however, in my opinion, it is a positive trend.
On the one hand, this trend has notable drawbacks. The main issue is that it is really hard for young people to make older people accept their leadership especially in some eastern nations. Young leaders are always thought to have insufficient capabilities to manage such aspects of policy as finance or international affairs. In addition, all of them are short of real experience. If they have not faced many challenges in their career, they are more likely to make mistakes, which can affect the lives of many people.
On the other hand, it seems to me that young people are becoming an increasingly important part of the government and bring a lot of benefits. One reason is that their youth is a huge advantage which allows them to be creative and up-to-date. This is likely to result in innovative breakthrough policies and styles of management. Furthermore, the young have a long period of time to contribute to their nation. For example, with the same abilities and qualifications, a younger candidate is more likely to be elected than an older counterpart in some countries because of his longer anticipated time of dedication to public service in the future.
In conclusion, although there are some strong arguments for and against both views, it seems to me that on the whole it is beneficial that more young people are being selected to play some key roles in the government.",7.5,band-7-5-essay-sample-more-young-people-now-occupy-positions-in-the-government
1110,Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not a problem because life will be easier if there are few languages. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.,"Every year many languages become extinct. Some people believe that many of these languages are not required. In their opinion, if everyone spoke the same language, it would make our lives easier. While this is true to a certain extent, I strongly believe that local languages need to be protected too.
It is true that if everyone speaks the same language, our lives will become easier. First of all, this eliminates the need to learn languages of other countries and saves us a lot of time and energy. Actually, we can use this time to perform other more fruitful work.
Secondly, when just one or two languages are used at the international level, it results in transparency and better communication. For example, English is the most widely used language in the world. Its international acceptance has made it the language of business and communication. Someone who speaks English can visit any part of the world without having to worry about language problems. This, however, does not mean that except for English, every other language should be allowed to die. English is important; so are other languages.
Extinction of languages whether they are used nationally or internationally will result in the death of core cultural values, customs and traditions. When languages die out, the culture associated with them will also die in due course of time. This can have disastrous consequences.
To conclude, languages need to be protected from extinction. They developed over thousands of years and reflect the culture of the people who speak them. If they die their culture won’t be able to survive. To make international communication easier, everyone should be encouraged to learn a second language like English.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-should-languages-be-allowed-to-die
1111,"In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people think it is good for the country, but others think that government should not allow salaries above certain levels. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In every country, there are a handful of people who earn extremely high salaries. Some people feel that these high achievers are good for the economy. Others, however, oppose this view. In their opinion, employee remuneration should be capped at a certain level. I also support this view.
Companies have their own reasons to pay high salaries. They want to attract the best talent. For example, companies like Google and Microsoft are famous for paying astronomical salaries because they want the best programmers to work for them. These well-paid employees are also more likely to work harder and propel their company to greater success. What’s more, they are unlikely to move to another company in search of better pay packets. Stiff competition exists for well-paying jobs. This encourages job aspirants to work harder. This competition is actually good for the nation because it increases the efficiency and competency of its workforce.
On the flip side, when a few people earn ridiculously high salaries, they create inferiority complex in those who are not as successful as them. Because of this reason some people feel that salaries should be capped at a certain level. I agree with this view. This will reduce inequality at the workplace. And when everyone enjoys more or less the same economic status, it will reduce poverty and crime rates in the society.
After analysing the situation it is not hard to see that capping salaries at a certain level actually builds equitable societies. After all, no one benefits when wealth gets concentrated in a few hands.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-governments-should-cap-ielts-essays-at-a-certain-level
1112,"As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Discuss.","Automation has become a part of our everyday life. In fact it is now widely used in the field of teaching. Some people believe that computers will replace human instructors in the near future. However, in my opinion, this will not happen because physical presence of the instructor in the class room is important for effective teaching and learning.
A teacher who is present in the classroom can easily understand whether the students are learning the topic at the current pace or any alteration in the teaching method is required. He or she can also figure out which students require more attention. For instance, my friend Samir was weak in his studies. Our science teacher often gave him special attention to keep him on the track. This could not have been possible if the teacher was not present in the classroom.
Interactive sessions during teaching are also equally important. Any doubts in the student’s mind are readily resolved during such sessions because they can ask questions and get answers instantly. For example, I was not good at mathematics while doing my graduation. Hence, I would note down all my doubts during the class. After the regular class hours, I would approach my professor with my doubts. Those direct interactive sessions with my teacher improved my grades.
On the other hand, a computer can only teach. It cannot figure out whether students have grasped the concepts or not. Not all students in a class are of the same intellectual level. Some learn fast while others require more attention. A computer will give the same attention to all students. This can affect the performance of poor students.
To conclude, a computer may be faster than a human being, but it is not more intelligent. It cannot replace human instructors in the classroom because of its inherent shortcomings. Automation has its limits and I don’t expect computers to replace human teachers in the near future.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-will-computers-replace-teachers-in-the-classroom
1113,"Academic institutions should only deal with academic studies and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, woodwork, tailoring are better to be taught at home by family members and friends. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your own experience.","Most academic institutions do not provide proper training in vocational subjects like carpentry or tailoring. They set aside 30 or 40 minutes a week for vocational training. In my opinion, that is enough. Not all students want to be a cook or a tailor. Those who would like to can get training from other places.
Everyone needs to receive at least basic training in academics. That is the reason these subjects are compulsorily taught in all schools. Vocational subjects, on the other hand, are optional. Only those who are interested in them need to learn them.
Schools already teach a lot of academic subjects and there is no justification for adding more subjects to the curriculum. Students who do well in academics do not normally aspire to be a potter, driver or tailor. Instead, they want to become doctors, teachers or engineers. These jobs are well-paid, secure and prestigious. The training that they receive from academic institutions is enough to equip them with the skills they need to achieve their goals. Therefore, I do not see anything wrong with educational institutions focusing on subjects like science, mathematics or literature.
Adding vocational subjects to the curriculum will only burden the students. Students who lack the aptitude for academic subjects and who would like to receive vocational training can learn the basics of these subjects from their schools itself. If they are convinced that they have what it takes to be a carpenter or a tailor, they can join vocational schools that provide training in these subjects. Alternatively they can learn the craft from a family member, neighbour or friend. This arrangement works fine and I have never heard a carpenter or a tailor complaining about the lack of training facilities for them. This is a clear sign that training in such vocations is already easily available.
To conclude, academic institutions do not have to provide training in cooking, carpentry or pottery. There are vocational institutes for this. Students who have an aptitude for such subjects can join these institutions and master the craft. And those who are not interested in them can focus on academics instead.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-academic-institutions-does-not-have-to-offer-train-in-woodwork-or-tailoring
1114,Some people say private schools should be banned because they give students an unfair advantage on others. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples from your own experience.,"Private schools are mushrooming because they provide better education. Unlike government funded schools they charge a fee. Still, parents send their children to private schools. Some people, however, feel that private schools should be banned because children going to those schools have an unfair advantage over those attending government schools. I don’t agree with this view.
Children attending private schools tend to get higher grades than those attending government schools. Private schools charge a fee. If they don’t provide good education, they will run out of business. Perhaps the biggest argument against private schools is that only rich students can attend them. Poor families still depend on government funded schools. Since many of these schools don’t provide quality education, the poor students are at a disadvantage. However, this problem cannot be solved by eliminating private schools from the scene.
Everyone should have access to quality education. In a country like India parents invest too much in their children’s education. I know families that borrow money to send their children to private schools. Instead of banning private schools, the government needs to do something to improve the quality of state-funded schools. If they were providing quality education, parents wouldn’t be sending their children to private schools in the private place.
Teachers at government schools are better qualified than private school teachers. They land the job after scoring good marks in various eligibility tests. By contrast, many private school teachers merely possess a degree. Still, their hard work ensures that their students have good grades. Many government school teachers, by contrast, lack commitment. They are not accountable to any. They will receive their salary whether their students pass their exams or not. This needs to change. The government should introduce a grading system that measures the performance of teachers as well. Those who lack commitment and sincerity should be dismissed promptly.
To conclude, banning private schools will not solve the problems plaguing our education system. Private schools address a need and that need should be met. In order to ensure that everyone has access to quality education, the government needs to improve the standards of government schools.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-private-schools-should-be-banned
1115,Politicians are more responsible for protection of the environment than individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Environment problems are threatening the very existence of life on this planet. Some people feel that environment protection is the responsibility of politicians. I don’t agree with this view. In my opinion, individuals and politicians need to make a joint effort to save the planet.
There is a limit to what an individual or a politician can achieve on his own. Politicians can frame laws to protect the environment. ‘Green’ laws are the need of the hour. Environment protection laws can stop factories from polluting the rivers and seas. They can stop deforestation. They can also prevent mindless quarrying and the destruction of natural resources. Even so, there is a limit to what we can accomplish through legislation.
A politician can’t control what people do in their private spaces. For example, many families burn plastic to get rid of it. They don’t realize that they are releasing harmful gases into the environment. Some families own four or five cars. They don’t understand that vehicular pollution is one of the chief causes of global warming. A lot of things that we do to increase our comfort have negative repercussions on the environment. We don’t realize that. When we drive a private car or fly, our carbon footprint increases. No politician can stop people from flying or using air conditioners in their homes. Aeroplanes, refrigerators and air conditioners all contribute to global warming and their users are ordinary citizens like you and me.

1116,"Many people believe that the gap between rich and poor is widening nowadays, because in the current economic situation the rich become richer while the poor become poorer. What are the problems this situation may cause? What measures can be taken to solve them?","There is no denying the fact that the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. This disparity in income is a direct result of  the flawed economic reforms that governments undertake.
The existing economic scenario in most countries only benefits the rich. In order to make money one needs access to education, technology or capital. The rich people already possess one or more of these. The internet, for example, created millions of jobs all over the world. However, only those who have access to the technology and the hardware can benefit from these jobs.
Most nations now follow a capitalistic economic model. Capitalism does not help the poor and the needy. It exploits their ignorance for the benefits of rich corporations. For example, big corporations are buying products from illiterate farmers at throwaway prices. They then sell these products at exorbitant rates and make a kill. The rich are taking over the land of the poor at cheap rates. After developing this land, they sell it for a huge profit. In the modern world, only those people who have access to capital or a good education can succeed. Since the poor people are unlikely to possess either, they are getting marginalized.
This situation causes numerous problems. Everyone should benefit from development. Sections that are excluded will feel resentment and may get into crime. To avoid this, the government needs to formulate polices that benefit the entire society. One way of ensuring this is to launch benefit programs for the poor. The government needs to ensure that everyone has access to education. This can be ensured by providing free education to the poor sections of the society. The government should also ensure that poor people have access to loans.

1117,Nowadays many people go shopping in their free time. Shopping has replaced many other activities that people used to choose as their hobby. What are the reasons for this? Is this a positive or negative development?,"More and more people now go shopping when they have a few hours to spare. For many people, shopping has become some sort of a therapy or hobby. There are many reasons behind this trend.
To start with, individuals with disposable incomes are on the rise. When people earn more than what they need to make both ends meet, they are unlikely to feel guilty about splurging on luxuries. So, they happily spend the surplus cash on various items. Consumerism also encourages people to go on a shopping spree. Ads are everywhere. Every day we get bombarded with numerous marketing messages. Savvy marketers convince us that we need to buy the latest products on the market to look fashionably cool. Credit cards have made shopping easier. Even if you don’t have cash on hand, you can buy things by entering your card details. People also shop to keep up with their friends or relatives.
Shopping for essential items is definitely harmless. However, a compulsive need to shop can have very negative consequences. There are people who shop till they drop. These compulsive shoppers have an insatiable need to amass things. They don’t care whether they are buying things that they actually need or use. Shopaholics easily run huge debts. People buy things thinking that they will be able to pay off their credit card bill when it is due. They run into serious trouble when they miss the due dates.
To conclude, excessive marketing and growing consumerism are the reasons that turn normal shoppers into shopaholics. This is a harmful trend that needs to be checked.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-many-people-go-shopping-in-their-free-time
1118,Some people think that organizations would benefit more from young managers than from older ones. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Young managers are well-aware of the latest developments in technology. They are ambitious and energetic. As a result, some people feel that young managers can run an organization better than older ones. I both agree and disagree with this view. In my opinion, both youngsters and seniors have their share of plusses and minuses.
Technology now plays an important role in the way an organization is run. It is therefore important for the organization to have a manager well-versed in the latest technology. Young people tend to have greater technological skills than older people. This makes them more suitable for leading organizations that depend too much on technology. Their age and energy also helps them to work long hours. In addition, many of them are unmarried. Since they don’t have many family commitments, they can devote their entire time to the organization.
On the flip side, young managers lack experience. They may have degrees and diplomas from world class institutes but they lack industry specific knowledge and experience. Older managers, on the other hand, have worked in their industry for several years. Their experience and practical knowledge enables them to take better decisions. Also they will have grown a vast network of connections during the years they worked in the industry and can leverage those connections for the benefit of the organization.
To conclude, young managers have their plus points. Senior managers have their plus points too. In some sectors young professionals are more suitable than seniors.

What could be a solution to the problem?,"Almost everyone owns a car these days. This is particularly true in the developed world where it is hard to find households without cars. Today, the situation in developing countries is not much different either. This trend has more drawbacks than advantages.
More and more people are buying cars. Private cars make traveling easier and make people independent of public transport systems. In addition to this obvious benefit, cars are a status symbol. This is particularly true in the developing world where one’s social standing improves when one buys a car. Unfortunately car ownership has lots of downsides too.
Vehicles are a major cause of air pollution in both developed and developing nations. They pollute the air we breathe and cause several health problems. While technology has developed a lot, most cars still use fossil fuels and their supplies are dwindling. At this rate of consumption, we may use up all the fuel in the world in a few decades. This is an alarming prospect.
Car ownership has several other downsides too. An increase in the number of vehicles on the road poses a threat to our safety as well. Too many vehicles lead to more accidents. Many of our cities don’t have the infrastructure to handle the excess of vehicles. This leads to traffic blocks. One way of reducing the number of cars on the roads is to improve the efficiency of the public transport system. If buses and trains run on time, few people will want to use a private car. The government should also consider making cars costly by imposing heavy taxes on them. Increasing the price of fuel may also discourage people from buying cars.
To conclude, private cars increase pollution and pose a threat to our safety. Improving the efficiency of public transport is the easiest way to discourage people from buying cars.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-why-do-people-buy-cars
1120,Some studies suggest that children spend more time watching TV than they did in the past and spend less on doing active and creative things. Why do you think this is happening? What measures and methods can be used to solve the issue?,"Television has turned most children into couch potatoes. They spend hours glued to the idiot box and show little interest in playing or socializing. Several factors have contributed to the development of this unhealthy trend.
First things first. In most families, TV assumes the role of a babysitter. Parents are usually busy with their own stuff and have little time for the child. So they switch the television on and put the child in front of it. Toddlers who watch a lot of TV will eventually become addicted to it. Excessive hours spent in front of the television also make kids obese. Obese children have little appetite for physical activities. They don’t enjoy running or jumping. They would rather sit and watch TV or play video games.
Another reason for television addiction is the rise of nuclear families. Many homes now have only one child. Children who have none to play with often find solace in the television set. Excessive screen time can lead to several problems. Kids who watch television for hours on end may develop obesity, diabetes and even cardiac problems. They may also have trouble focusing on their studies.
In this day and age when everyone has access to hundreds of television channels it is hard to wean children off their screen addiction. However, this is possible if parents and teachers make a concerted effort. Parents should set time limits and enforce them. They should stop using TV as a babysitter. Instead, they should encourage the child to do something creative. Parents can, for example, enroll their children in extracurricular classes. In many congested urban areas children do not have access to playgrounds. This too needs to change. The government needs to build parks and recreational areas everywhere. In addition, schools should make physical activity an integral part of the curriculum.
To conclude, if parents and teachers make a joint effort, they will not have much difficulty curing the children of their TV addiction.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-children-spend-too-much-time-watching-tv
1121,Some people think that governments should give financial support to creative artists such as painters and musicians. Others believe that creative artists should be funded by alternative sources. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"People have different views about how artists should be funded. Some people believe that the government should fund them. Others believe that they should get funding from other sources. In my opinion, the government should do what it can. Artists also need to market their work themselves.
Art is a reflection of the society. Artists make great contributions to the development of a nation’s culture. Their works represent heritage, culture and tradition. In India, for example, we can learn a lot about the glorious past of our country from the majestic palaces, temples and monuments built centuries ago. Such monuments are the work of skilled craftsmen and sculptors. From their works present and future generations can learn a lot about their country’s past. Just like the rest of us, artists are mortal but their work outlives them. In this day and age many of them are finding it difficult to earn a livelihood. If the government does not support them they will have to choose other careers.
On the flip side, there is a limit to the amount of money governments can spend for the welfare of their artists. They have to take care of more pressing needs. For instance, spending money on education, public health and infrastructure building is even more important. Nowadays nations also face great threat from terrorism. The government needs to constantly monitor criminal activities inside the country. These services are vital for a country to function properly. Creative pursuits, on the other hand, are purely recreational. There is yet another argument against government funding of artists. They are like any other professionals – they must market their work themselves and earn money.
To conclude, there are arguments both in favour of and against government funding of artists. In my opinion, artists should support themselves to the best of their ability. The government should also lend a helping hand.

1122,Some people think that watching sports in one’s free time is just a waste of time. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Sports and games make people more active and healthier. However, just because someone watches a sporting event in their free time, it doesn’t mean that they will play it. Some people, therefore, feel that watching sports is a waste of time. This argument certainly sounds logical but I don’t agree with it.
Watching sports in one’s free time certainly doesn’t make one healthier. This, however, does not mean that watching sports is a waste of time. Someone who watches a game is more likely to play it than someone who doesn’t watch it at all.
The biggest benefit of watching sporting events is that it encourages the viewer to try their skills at those games. The vast majority of children and youngsters who watch football and cricket on television play these games when they opportunity. This improves their fitness levels. During such sessions, some children also discover their hidden talents. If they didn’t watch these games on television, they wouldn’t play them. Of course, a person who only watches a game and does not play it will not benefit much. All those hours spent in front of the TV can actually make them obese. Even so, there are several life lessons that we can learn from sports. The most important is the ability to accept success and defeat alike.
Another benefit of watching sporting events is that it provides entertainment and relaxation. Most of us lead extremely stressful lives these days. Sport provides relaxation and helps beat stress. There is one more reason to watch sports. Sporting events have become a major business. People who watch them on television or from a stadium are helping local and global economy in many ways.
To conclude, watching sporting events during one’s free time is not a waste of time. Someone who watches sports and games are also more likely to play them. This will have a positive impact on their health.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-watching-sports-is-a-waste-of-time
1123,"In many cities the population is increasing. Some say that the urbanization process denies us knowing our neighbours, and this causes a loss of community sense. What is the main problem with this? What measures can be taken to overcome it?","Urbanisation has both positive and negative aspects. People living in urban areas have better access to amenities and lead more comfortable lives. Unfortunately, urbanisation also creates a sense of alienation in people. Actually, many of them don’t even know who their neighbours are. This makes each urban resident a small island.
Jobs are mainly concentrated in urban areas. That is the reason people migrate to cities. Cities have more people living in small spaces. This actually brings them closer physically. You are always in the midst of a crowd. Still, cities fail to connect people. People rarely interact even with their neighbours unless they are compelled to do. Unfortunately this makes them feel lonely and insecure.
There are several reasons behind this. To start with, in a typical metropolitan city people from all over the country and sometimes from different parts of the world live. You don’t know who they are. You don’t know anything about their background. You don’t know whether they are good or bad. As a result, you keep them at arm’s length. You only interact with people you know. For example, in a city like Mumbai, you have neighbours from all over India. They speak very different languages. The difference in language acts as a barrier here preventing people from interacting with one another.
One way of overcoming this problem is to discourage the migration to cities by creating more jobs in small towns. Decentralisation helps the national economy in several different ways. And those who live in cities should start showing an active interest in their neighbours. Housing complexes need to organize programs that give their residents an opportunity to get to know one another.
To conclude, fear of strangers is the main reason that prevents urban dwellers from building relationships with their neighbours. This inability certainly makes them lonely. The only way to get around this problem is to start trusting people and showing an interest in them. Creating more jobs in villages and small cities will also help by preventing the exodus of people into cities.",7.5,ielts-essay-urbanisation-leads-to-loneliness
1124,Some people say that living in high-rise apartments feels very lonely and makes people unhappy. Others say there are advantages to living in a big apartment building. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Where we live perhaps has no real impact on how we feel. People living in high rise buildings also have neighbours and it is possible to make friends with them. So, I don’t think that just because someone is living in a high-rise apartment, it will make them lonely and unhappy. It all depends upon our general disposition.
Some people enjoy spending time with others. They make friends wherever they live. They are sociable and find happiness in company. When such people live in high-rise apartments, they will have friends there as well. Actually many apartment complexes have amenities like clubs, gyms and amphitheatres. These amenities provide a greater opportunity to interact with others living in the same housing complex. On the flip side, apartment living might make it difficult for introverts to make friends. Since they are unlikely to go out and make friends, they may detest living in apartments where their chances of coming face to face with their neighbours are rather slim. Such people will be better off living in traditional houses where they have greater opportunities to meet and interact with their neighbours.
Apartment living has several benefits. Apartments tend to be safer than standalone homes with large yards. Also, high rise apartments provide excellent views. A lot of people enjoy the panoramic view of the surroundings they get from their apartments.
Another benefit is the easy access to amenities. Since high rise apartments are more likely to be located in prime residential areas, people living in them will have better access to amenities. Also, apartment buildings tend to have several amenities that homes lack. For example, many of them have gyms, clubs, amphitheatre, jogging parks and swimming pool. While it is possible to build such facilities in homes, very few homes actually have these.
To conclude, apartment living certainly does not make a person lonely or unhappy. If a person is sociable they will have friends no matter where they live and if they are not sociable they will feel lonely in traditional homes as well.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-do-high-rise-apartments-make-people-lonely-and-unhappy
1125,Some parents think that helping their children with homework is good. Others think children should do their homework on their own. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Homework is a necessary evil. I don’t know many children who actually enjoy doing their homework. Nonetheless, it is beneficial to their progress and that is the reason teachers give homework. However, sometimes, children are given too much homework and in such situations it may be necessary for the parents to help them.
Children should do their homework on their own. Only then will they benefit. If parents do the homework the children are not getting the intended benefits. However, there are at least a few situations where this may be necessary. Young children, especially those attending KG or primary school, will need their parents’ assistance to complete their homework and other activities. Older children may also need their parents’ help from time to time.
In a country like India, children, especially those going to private schools, are burdened with too much homework. After completing their work, they get hardly any time to study. In such situations, they need the help of their parents. Just because students are doing their homework, it doesn’t mean that they are actually paying attention to what they are doing. A lot of them simply copy answers from their notebook. As a result, they aren’t gaining anything from this exercise. They need to learn the answers to score higher grades in the examination. If they spend too much time on their homework, their score will suffer.
To conclude, students are supposed to do their homework on their own. However, this is not always possible because of time constraints. In such situations, parents should lend a helping hand.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-should-parents-help-their-children-with-homework
1126,"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to 6 years of free education to children, so that they can at least read, write and use numbers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement?","Education plays a crucial role in alleviating poverty. Take a look at the developed nations in the world. It is not hard to see that the biggest strength of these nations is their educated workforce. So, I agree with the argument that the best way to reduce poverty in developing nations is to provide free education to their children. While, six years of free education isn’t sufficient, it is definitely better than no education at all.
Education has the potential to change lives. Educated people can protect themselves from exploitation at the workplace. They earn better salaries. All of these improve their chances of freeing themselves from the shackles of poverty.
Besides improving the finances of a person, education helps them improve the overall quality of their life. Perhaps the biggest benefit of receiving education is that they will pass it down to the next generation. Educated parents will ensure that their children also receive education.
Education throws open many doors. An ability to read and write improves one’s understanding of one’s surroundings. Just because someone has received a few years’ of schooling, they are unlikely to be able to land a good job. Even so, a little education is much better than no education at all. An ability to read and write makes them aware of their rights. In many countries the government has several welfare schemes for the poor. However, many of them are not aware of these schemes and cannot take advantage of them. They are often deceived by unscrupulous leaders and politicians who pocket the benefits meant for them.
To conclude, even primary education has the potential to improve lives and reduce poverty. Therefore, I strongly agree with the argument that it should be free for all children.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-free-education-will-help-fight-poverty-in-developing-nations
1127,"The subjects that children are taught in schools are decided by the central government. Some people say that teachers, not politicians, should be responsible for this task. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the opinion?","In many countries it is common for the government to interfere with school syllabi. Some people think that this is unfair. In their opinion, the lessons taught in schools should be chosen by teachers, and not politicians. I agree with this. Political interference in education will not benefit the students or the nation.
Teachers are subject experts. Because of their knowledge and experience, they are able to choose subjects which are beneficial to students when they go for higher studies. They are also able to choose lessons of the right difficulty levels.
On the flip side, political interference in education can have disastrous consequences. Politicians often rewrite subjects like history and civics to further their own interests. Sometimes this is done to further the cause of nationalism, but most of the times it is done to promote the specific interests of a party. By simply omitting certain lessons from history textbooks, the government can erase the contributions of a particular section of the society or dynasty. Sometimes students are forced to learn the biographies of leaders whose contribution to the nation or the world is negligible. This is a common practice in India. In fact, history textbooks are revised whenever there is a change of power at the center. Politicians only want to promote the interests of their own party. Worse, many of them lack the knowledge or expertise to draft school syllabi.
To conclude, teachers and academicians are the right people to design the syllabus. They know what to include and what not to include. Politicians should not be allowed to interfere in education.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-government-interference-in-school-syllabi
1128,Spending public money to promote a healthy lifestyle that leads to an improved quality of life is better than spending it on treatment of people who are already ill. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement?,"Prevention is better than cure. If the government spends money on promoting a healthy lifestyle, it will not have to spend much on the treatment of illnesses. Therefore I totally agree with the given view.
A healthy lifestyle leads to fewer illnesses. If the government creates awareness about a healthy lifestyle and promotes it actively, people are less likely to fall ill. In many countries the government bears a part of the healthcare costs of its people. Poor patients depend entirely on government aid. Needless to say, healthcare costs put a major burden on the public exchequer.
There are several benefits to preventing illnesses. A healthy society is a productive society. It is prosperous and happy. Illnesses result in loss of work hours. By simply spending money on promoting a healthy lifestyle, the government can create a productive workforce. This will not only reduce healthcare costs, but also increase the GDP of the nation. Oftentimes lack of awareness about healthy and unhealthy habits is the cause of illnesses. The government can do a lot of things here. It must make vaccination mandatory. Vaccines should be given free or at subsidized costs. This will make them available to more and more children. In addition, the government should spend money on promoting awareness against unhealthy habits like smoking, drinking and substance abuse. By doing these the government can ensure that its people are healthy and happy.
To conclude, prevention is always better than cure. Spending money on preventing illnesses is way better than spending it on treating them. In my opinion, the governments, doctors and non-governmental organizations can all play an important role in creating a healthy and happy society.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-spending-money-on-preventing-illnesses-is-better-than-spending-it-on-treating-them
1129,"Economic progress is often used to measure a country’s success. However, some people believe that other factors are more important. What other factors are more important? What other factors should also be considered when measuring a country’s success? Do you think one factor is more important than others?","There is a common belief that development is all about achieving economic growth. If we use this yardstick, western countries are the most developed in the world. Some people, however, believe that economic growth is just one of the many factors that contribute to the development of a nation. I agree with this view. In my opinion, the overall quality of life and the freedom that people enjoy in a country are all important factors to consider.
Some Middle Eastern countries are economically developed; however, they have authoritative governments that give little importance to personal freedom. In many of these countries, people cannot speak about the government or express their opinions on the internet. The plight of their women is even worse. They are deprived of education and many of them don’t even have the right to vote. In my opinion, in spite of their economic growth, these countries cannot be considered developed.
Countries in the west are generally considered developed because of their prosperity and improved standards of living. In these countries, too, many people experience loneliness and lead unhappy lives. It is evident that all that prosperity does nothing to improve their lives.
Economic growth is important. People should be able to satisfy their basic necessities and lead healthy and happy lives. However, economic development alone won’t make a nation developed. Safety, happiness and freedom of speech and expression are all important things to consider.
To conclude, economic prosperity is just one of the many factors that determine the success or development of a nation. The overall quality of life is determined by a lot of other factors. These include access to quality education, healthcare, safety and freedom.

1130,Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for visiting cultural and historical places. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"In many countries, foreign tourists visiting historic and cultural places are required to pay more than local tourists. Some support this; others are against it. In my opinion, asking foreigners to pay more is not ethical; however, it makes great commercial sense.
Tourism is a major business. In many countries it is the biggest earner of foreign exchange. So nations that have historic or cultural places that attract a large number of foreigners have every incentive to charge them more. For example, in India a local tourist can visit Taj Mahal for a negligible fee. A foreigner, on the other hand, is required to pay a considerably higher fee. There is yet another dimension to this. Foreign currency, especially the dollar, pound and euro, has higher purchasing power than currencies of other nations. Ten dollar means a lot when you convert that into Indian rupee, but it is not a big sum for an American. So, nobody is really complaining. By charging foreigners more, the government can also collect enough funds towards the maintenance of cultural and historic places.
While foreigners are only interested in the architectural or cultural value of a monument, a domestic traveler may have a deeper attachment to it. It could be much more than a tourist place to them. The Sun Temple at Konark attracts lots of foreigners who are primarily interested in its architectural brilliance. For an Indian, it is also a place of worship and if the government charges a higher entry fee it will amount to the violation of their right to worship. In addition, the smaller fee encourages more and more domestic tourists to explore their country. This fosters cultural understanding and instills in them a deeper respect and love for their mother country.
To conclude, charging foreigners more makes great economic sense. Locals, on the other hand, should be provided free or subsidized access to historic or cultural places.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-foreigners-visiting-cultural-places-should-pay-more
1131,"Some people say that it’s better for children to grow up in a city, while others say growing up in the countryside is better. Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion.","Growing up in a city has its benefits. Likewise, growing up in the countryside has its benefits too. In my opinion, the city and the countryside provide different experiences and it is impossible to say whether urban life is better than rural life.
Children raised in cities will be more familiar with modern innovations. They get to visit shopping malls, use escalators and live in apartments where they have the opportunity to mingle with people coming from different parts of the country or world. My children, for example, were raised in Mumbai. They are able to speak four languages because our neighbours are from different parts of the country. They have better access to amenities. My nephews, on the other hand, live in the countryside. They have never used an escalator or ridden the Metro. They have only eaten local dishes, whereas my kids have tasted a variety of cuisines – both national and international.
On the other hand, my nephews know a lot of things that my children don’t know. They have a better understanding our culture and tradition. They know how to conduct themselves in front of elders. Better still, they know a lot of things about the nature. They are familiar with agricultural practices. They know the names of various plants and animals. When my children visit our parents’ home in the countryside, they struggle to cope. My nephews, on the other hand, have no such problems when they visit us in Mumbai. I think children raised in the countryside are better equipped to deal with a variety of situations. They also possess a greater understanding of their surroundings. Of course, there are several benefits to living in cities, but the rural life cannot be considered inferior to the urban life.
To conclude, the urban life and the rural life have their own specific advantages. In my opinion, every child should have the opportunity to spend at least a few years of their life in the countryside. It will broaden their horizons and equip them with the skills they need to survive in all circumstances.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-it-is-better-to-raise-children-in-cities-than-in-the-countryside
1132,"Nowadays it is easy to apply for and get a credit card. However, some people experience problems when they are not be able to pay their debts back. In your opinion, do the advantages of credit cards outweigh the disadvantages?","Nowadays anyone with a decent credit score can get a credit card. Credit cards increase the purchasing power of people and improve their living standards. Unfortunately, if the cards are not used with care, they will land the holder in serious debts. In my opinion, credit cards have both advantages and disadvantages.
People can benefit from their credit card in several ways. It gives them immediate access to credit. It helps in emergency situations or when they want to buy something expensive. One of my friends, for example, paid for his thyroid surgery using his credit card. Some credit card companies also offer zero percent interest rates on home appliances. Using this option middle and lower income families can buy washing machines or refrigerators on easy monthly installments. Thus credit cards improve their lifestyle. Credit cards also eliminate the need to carry cash in one’s wallet.
On the flip side, credit cards can push people into serious debts traps. They have destroyed many lives and careers. Cards make people compulsive shoppers. They encourage people to buy all the products in the market even though they do not need them. This temptation to overspend has disastrous consequences. Credit cards are good if you can pay off the entire balance when it is due. Credit card loans have much higher interest rates than other loans. If you only pay the minimum balance, you will end up paying a lot of interest. What’s more, credit card transactions carry increased risk of fraud. Someone who knows your card number and other credentials can easily buy stuff using your card without your knowledge or permission.
To conclude, credit cards are definitely a beneficial invention, but we need to use them wisely to reap their benefits.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-do-credit-cards-have-more-advantages-than-disadvantages
1133,Early technological developments helped ordinary people and changed their lives more than recent developments. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Technology has developed throughout the history of man, but the innovations differ in their impact. In my opinion technology has both positive and negative impacts but older technologies are more beneficial than newer technologies.
Older technologies benefited people in several ways. Take for instance, the invention of the wheel. It changed the course of our life for good. The inventions of the electric motor, light bulb, steam engine and railways have had similar impacts on our life. It is now impossible to imagine a life without motor vehicles or electric bulbs.
By contract, relatively newer innovations like television, telephone, computer, refrigerator and smart phone have both positive and negative impacts. Many of them are not essential in our life. Television may have brought entertainment to the living room, but it also gave birth to a generation of couch potatoes. As for its impact on our life, well, it is absolutely possible to live without it. Computers also have both positive and negative effects. Computers improved our efficiency. In fact, in recent times, there has been no other innovation that has had such a profound impact on our lives. Unfortunately, computers and video games also made people lazier. When we sit in front of a computer for long hours it affects our health in many ways. These negative impacts, however, cannot be used to discount the positive impacts of the computer. It is, by far, the most useful innovation of our lifetime. Smart phone is another innovation that has both positive and negative effects. Most of us cannot even imagine a life without our mobile phones, but the overall positive impact of smart phones on our lives is rather negligible. The thing is no one needs to be connected to the entire world all the time. In fact, the constant connectivity has made our lives more stressful.
To conclude, technology is neither good nor bad. It depends upon the way we use it. Still, I feel that older technologies were more beneficial. As for newer innovations, well, we can actually do without many of them.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-were-older-technologies-more-beneficial-than-newer-technologies
1134,Some people say that the government should stop TV and newspapers from showing crimes because media coverage of violent crimes is frightening people and encouraging criminals. Do you agree or disagree?,"Media gives too much importance to violence because of its shock value. Violence frightens people. It disgusts them but at the same time it interests them. Media coverage of violence has both positive and negative effects on the society.
Generally speaking, people have too much interest in crimes. They enjoy reading about such events. That is the reason media covers such events. Violent stories disgust most people. They also encourage criminals. Just because some people will be encouraged to commit crimes after reading about them, the media should not be asked to stop covering such events.
The primary duty of media is to inform people of all the good and bad things happening in the society. Since violence is on the rise, media needs to report it. They, however, need to ensure that they are not promoting or glorifying such crimes.
Media coverage of violence has some benefits. On the one hand, violent events frighten people. On the other hand, it encourages them to take the precautions to stay safe. For example, parents who read about the abduction and murder of children will take the measures to ensure that their child does not become the next casualty. People often commit horrible crimes under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Youngsters who read about such crimes will think twice before indulging in such practices themselves. On the down side, excessive coverage of violence can make people insensitive to them. The vast majority of people who watch visuals of gory murders are repelled by what they see. Unfortunately, if we keep seeing such visuals, we will stop becoming affected by them. This apathy can be dangerous. Worse still, it can encourage people with criminal tendencies to commit similar crimes.
To conclude, coverage of violence certainly has both positive and negative impacts on the society. This, however, does not mean that the government should ask media to stop covering such events. Any such move will amount to curbing the freedom of the press.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-should-government-ask-media-to-stop-reporting-violence
1135,"In some countries, more and more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","There has been a dramatic increase in the number of people who live alone. This trend is more rampant in the west than in Asian countries. In my opinion, living alone has its advantages and disadvantages.
I will start with the advantages. People who live alone are better at shouldering responsibilities than those living with their family. They ensure that their rents and bills are paid on time. They learn to take care of themselves. They can cook and clean. In short they know how to lead an independent life. This lifestyle is particularly beneficial to people who seek total privacy. People who live alone are also able to do whatever they want to because there is no one to restrict them. In short, they are free birds.
On the flip side, there are several disadvantages to living alone. People who live alone are more likely to develop psychological problems like depression. Man is a gregarious creature. We are hardwired to find happiness in the company of others. When we isolate ourselves, we will face several problems. The biggest disadvantage of living alone is the lack of emotional support. Lonely people have no one to offer them support or guidance when they face problems or defeats. An unrestricted lifestyle may also make them addicted to several bad habits. This will ruin their life and relations. Worse still, they have none to help them during an emergency situation such as an illness or a natural disaster. For instance, one of my friends who lived alone in Australia recently died of a heart attack. When he experienced pain in the chest, none of his family members or friends was there to help him.
To conclude, living alone has both positive and negative impacts on our lives. In my opinion, every one of us has the right to lead a lifestyle of our choice. However, we need to ensure that our preferences do not hurt our family members or ourselves.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-living-alone
1136,Sports programmes are hugely popular on television nowadays. But some people argue that these programmes are to blame for the poor health of many young people who prefer to watch rather than part take in physical activity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, youngsters are showing too much interest in watching sporting events on television. Some people believe that instead of watching games on television, teenagers should play sports to maintain good health. I agree with this view. If young people spend too much time watching sports on TV, it will definitely have an adverse impact on their health. However, I don’t think that sports shows are the only culprits here. Several other factors also affect the health of youngsters.
The purpose of sports and games is to keep us healthy and active. In addition, games give us lots of enjoyment and happiness. But watching sporting events on TV for long hours may cause many health issues such as obesity and eye-sight problems. For instance, the New York University conducted a research which showed that the weight of youngsters increase by more than 30% when they spend too much time watching sports on television.  Obesity has become a major health problem in recent times. Young people are addicted to a sedentary lifestyle and they show little interest in playing games. Worse, they even neglect their studies. As we can see, too much screen time is certainly bad.
Having said that, there are several benefits to watching sporting events on television. When young people watch sports and games on television, they are also more likely to feel the temptation to play these games. They will also learn more about these events. For example, Rugby is a North American game but now many teenagers in India play this game after learning about it from television. Youngsters can learn all the rules, regulations and technical specifications of a game by watching it on the small screen.  In my country, even children understand the technical aspects of cricket because they watch it on TV.
To conclude, I feel that watching sports on television has both positive and negative consequences. Youngsters need to realize that if they want to enjoy the health benefits of sports and games, they need to play these games rather than watch them on TV.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-watching-sports-on-television-affects-the-health-of-young-people
1137,"Some people think that it is good for a country’s culture to broadcast foreign films and TV shows. Others, however, think it is best to produce local films and shows. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There are quite a few things that we can learn from foreign films and TV shows. This, however, does not mean that we should stop producing local films and shows. In my opinion, every nation should strive to produce high quality films and television programs that showcase their culture and values.
Hollywood films are now popular all over the world. Regional films enjoy less popularity; however, that is not a reason to stop producing local films. If Hollywood films are popular, that is because of their big budget. They use cutting edge technology to create films that find viewers all over the world. Small budget films produced in local languages can be just as good, if not better. India, for example, has a thriving regional film industry. The film industry in Kerala and West Bengal produce high quality films that win awards at both national and international film festivals. They may not enjoy the same commercial success as Bollywood or Hollywood films, but they showcase the culture of these states and give their people a voice and identity.
I am not against watching foreign films, but I strongly disagree with the argument that we can promote the culture of a country by broadcasting foreign films. Films and television programs have a huge impact on people. Children who grow up watching only foreign or English films may find it difficult to connect with their culture. This cultural alienation will not help a nation in any way. In my opinion, every country should produce its own literature, music and movies. One should look at these art forms as a channel to promote one’s own culture.
To conclude, every nation should produce their own films and shows to promote their culture. There is no harm in watching foreign films, but our goal must be producing films that foreigners will also enjoy watching.",7.5,ielts-essay-about-foreign-films-and-local-films
1138,"Nowadays many historic buildings don’t receive preservation treatment, with some buildings being damaged or even destroyed. Why is this happening? What can be done to change this situation?","Historic buildings are being neglected because people don’t understand their value. They are being destroyed because people want to build modern structures in their place.
Historic buildings occupy prime real estate. Most of them are in the centre of cities where land prices are ridiculously high. As a result, sometimes the civic administration is under pressure to demolish these old or dilapidated buildings and construct shopping malls or housing complexes in their place. Sometimes greed and utter disregard for history also force civic authorities to demolish old buildings.
Old buildings lack modern amenities. Also they require a great deal of maintenance. Some historic buildings like palaces are owned by families. Many of them lack the financial resources to maintain these buildings. While some families convert palaces into luxury hotels, others choose to demolish them to build residences with modern amenities.
Historic buildings require more maintenance than modern buildings. Creating awareness about their significance is the first step towards their preservation. We should also be able to find modern uses for these structures. Impressive buildings have the potential to attract tourists. For example, India has numerous palaces and forts that generate considerable revenue from tourism. Since these buildings generate money, the government wants to preserve them. Buildings that lack such potential are often ignored. And if they are situated in important areas of the city, they are more likely to face the threat of demolition.
Creating awareness about their importance alone will not help. The government should also be able to convert them into useful structures. Palaces, for example, can be converted into hotels or museums.
To conclude, historic buildings require a great deal of maintenance and that is the main reason they are neglected. If they don’t generate revenue they become a financial liability in spite of their importance. The only way to prevent their destruction is to find newer ways to use them.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-why-are-historic-buildings-being-neglected
1139,"Some people say that the government should invest in trains and the subway system to prevent traffic congestion in large cities. Others, however, think it should build wider roads. Discuss both views and give your own opinion and examples.","Trains are a faster and greener mode of transport. A single train can carry many thousands of people. Therefore, the argument that the government should invest in trains to reduce the traffic congestion certainly holds water. In my opinion, the government should also build wider roads.
Railways are not necessarily an alternative to roadways. They are both important modes of transport used by millions of people every day. Railways complement roadways and vice versa. Because of this reason, the government needs to invest in both.
Generally speaking, people do not normally use trains for traveling short distances. For example, very few people will board a train to go to the supermarket or the library in their town. They are more likely to take a bus or a car. If the roads aren’t wide, they will get stuck in the traffic.
People don’t always live or work within walking distance of the railway station. Also, trains don’t reach every part of a city. By contrast, roads connect almost all areas. In Mumbai, for example, people use both trains and buses/cars every day. They use the bus service to reach the railway station. They need both wider roads and more reliable trains to commute faster. Ideally, a city should have both – a well-developed rail network and wider roads.
To conclude,  we need to build both wider roads and a better rail network to solve the traffic woes of a city,  Roads can’t always be a substitute for trains. Likewise, trains can’t be a substitute for cars or buses.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-some-people-believe-that-governments-should-invest-in-trains-to-solve-traffic-problems
1140,"There is an argument among scientists regarding wild animals. Some of them believe in saving wild animals of all kinds, others, however, are interested in saving only particular species. Discuss both views, give your own opinion and examples.","The conservation of wildlife is a hotly debated topic. Slowly but steadily we are becoming aware of the need to protect wildlife.  Some scientists believe that only certain species of animals should be protected; others are of the opinion that all forms of wildlife should be protected. I agree with the latter point of view.
I firmly believe that all forms of life born here have a right to live here. Human beings are the only species that have trouble coexisting with other forms of life. We behave as if the whole world belonged to us. We exploit other forms of life to satisfy our need and greed. Tigers, lions and crocodiles are being killed for their skin. Elephants are being killed for their precious tusks. Snakes are being killed; so are whales. Sadly many of these species are now facing the threat of extinction.
I can’t agree with the argument that only selected species should be protected. Scientists who put forward this theory are only concerned with the well-being of the mankind. The species that they want to protect will most probably be the ones that are beneficial to human beings. That is the only reason they want to protect those species in the first place. Unfortunately, this tactic has several downsides. To start with, all forms of life are essential to protecting the biodiversity and ecosystem. If one species becomes extinct because of our wrongdoings or factors beyond our control, it is going to have an impact on other species as well. Unfortunately, we are yet to realize this. Our greed is destroying in the planet. We don’t realize that we will also get destroyed when other species die.
To conclude, the argument that only certain species of life should be protected doesn’t hold water. It stems from the belief that we own this planet and that every other form of life exists for our benefit. If we are really concerned with our well-being, it is time we did something to protect the planet and its inhabitants without discriminating one against the other.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-some-scientists-believe-that-only-certain-species-of-wildlife-should-be-protected
1141,There is an increasing trend of old people living longer in many countries around the world. Do you think this has a positive or a negative effect on the population as a whole? Give your own opinion and relevant examples.,"People are living longer because of advances in medical science and improved living standards. Longevity is definitely a positive thing, but it has some negative aspects too.
Longevity is a clear sign that living standards have improved and that more and more people have access to medical attention and lifesaving drugs. Longevity is a direct reflection of the living standards prevailing in a society. Countries where people live longer are also the countries that score well on other social parameters. So, if people are living longer, it is an indication that a lot of factors have improved.
On the flip side, living long is a risk. When the rate of birth in a country is much higher than their rate of death, their need for various resources will also increase. They need more food, water and energy. While living longer is a positive thing, this puts strain on natural resources which are already nearing exhaustion. An increase in the population of the aged also means an increase in health care and insurance costs. This can put strain on the public exchequer.
Another problem that greying societies face is the shortage of skilled manpower. Seniors are not very productive. Most of them require care and assistance. Some European countries are already facing this problem. Germany, for example, faces a severe shortage of talented workers. As a result, they have to depend on immigrants.
To conclude, longevity is definitely a positive thing, but countries where seniors outnumber young people are more likely to face a number of problems. In other words, longevity has both positive and negative impacts on the society. As far as the person is concerned, it is definitely a positive thing; however, it has several repercussions for the society.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-people-are-living-longer-is-this-a-positive-or-negative-development
1142,"The Internet has brought many changes into our day to day life. Nowadays we can do things such as mailing, contacting, banking and communication much faster. Is this a positive or negative development?","The internet has revolutionized our lives. It has changed the way we connect with our friends and family. It has changed the way we access information and buy things. It has enabled people to work from their home. In my opinion, the internet has more positive impacts than negative impacts on our lives.
The internet has made information accessible to everyone. Much of the content on the internet is free. Anyone who has an internet connection can access it from any part of the world. Having an internet connection is a bit like having access to all the books in the world. In my opinion, this is the biggest advantage of the internet. Because of it, people can now get medical and financial advice online. Students can prepare for their tests online.
Internet also allows us to buy and sell things online from the comfort of our home. Online transactions save time and money. Another advantage of the internet is its ability to facilitate communication. Thanks to technologies such as video conferencing, people living in different parts of the world can now participate in online conferences at the same time. This eliminates the need for them to travel to another country just for the sake of attending a conference.
The internet has its fair share of disadvantages too. Plenty of obscene and offensive content is available online. While surfing the internet, children might stumble upon this content accidentally. In recent times, anti-social elements have started using the internet to recruit youngsters. This has become a major threat to the security of nations.
To conclude, the internet has both positive and negative impacts; however, in my opinion the positives outweigh the negatives. It has connected the world and made opportunities available to everyone. In fact, today, it is impossible for us to imagine a life without the internet.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-the-internet
1143,"In many countries prison is the most common solution to crime problems. However, some people believe that better education will be a more effective solution. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion.","The practice of imprisoning criminals isn’t something that started recently. Prisons existed in the earliest human societies as well. Whether prisons have been able to reform criminals is a debatable topic; however, in my opinion, they should be there.
The fear of imprisonment acts as a major deterrent and prevents many people from committing crimes. No one wants to get locked up. If there were no prisons or a system for punishing the guilty, the society would be much less safe.
Prisons probably have not been able to reform the criminals. While some come out as reformed individuals, many become hardened criminals after spending time behind the bars. Therefore, I have hardly any faith in the ability of prisons to reform people. Still, while criminals are behind the bars, people can live without having to fear them. Locking them up is definitely an effective way of protecting the society from them.
Creating awareness about the ill effects of crime through education is definitely worth trying. However, I don’t think that education will solve all the problems plaguing the society. When people are made aware of the consequences of their actions, they may be less inclined to commit crimes. Still, believing that by simply providing education we will be able to reform the entire humanity seems foolhardy. If things were that easy, we wouldn’t be seeing so much criminal activity today.
Many people who commit crimes are actually aware of their actions. They know what they are doing. They hail from influential families. It is not the lack of education that prompts them to commit crimes – rather it is the belief that they will be able to get away with their crimes. These are the kind of people who need to be locked up.
To conclude, education might be beneficial in creating awareness; however, it cannot replace the penal system or prisons. If we want to live without fear, we need a system to prosecute criminals and put them behind bars.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-is-education-more-effective-than-prisons-in-curbing-crimes
1144,"In many countries, supermarkets have caused small shops to close down. Is this having more advantages or more disadvantages?","The supermarket boom has forced many small vendors to shut shops. This is definitely disadvantageous to them. On the flip side, supermarkets have helped local and national economies in several ways. Let me elaborate on this.
Supermarkets promote economic growth. They employ lots of people and job creation certainly helps the local economy. Since supermarkets attract a large number of consumers, the area surrounding them also tends to develop owing to increased consumer activity. It is not uncommon for supermarkets to bring about the infrastructural development of the area surrounding them. This actually benefits other businesses operating in the immediate neighborhood. In fact, even the prices of residential properties go up if there is a supermarket or a shopping mall in their vicinity. These are all examples of the positive impact of supermarkets.
Supermarkets have made shopping easier and hassle-free. When a customer can buy all that they need from one shop, they save time and money. They don’t have to go from shop to shop looking for that tin of canned fish or bottle of milk. It is this convenience that makes supermarkets quite popular with customers.
On the flip side, supermarkets have certainly made small shops redundant. Many of them have shut down because they cannot compete with a big store that sells just about everything under one roof. So while supermarkets provide jobs to some people, they also cause the loss of employment for some others.
To conclude, supermarkets have both positive and negative impacts on the society. Generally speaking they are beneficial to the society, but small shop owners certainly bear the brunt of their popularity. Still, in my opinion, supermarkets have more positive impacts than negative impacts on the society.",7.5,ielts-essay-about-supermarkets-and-small-shops
1145,"Some people believe that watching TV is good and makes life more enjoyable; others, however, think it is a waste of time. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion.","There is no denying the fact that television makes our lives more enjoyable. Everyone likes to sit in front of their television sets. This, however, does not mean that all that time spent watching TV is good for us. In my opinion, watching TV is good provided that we choose the programs wisely.
Television provides both education and entertainment. There are several informative programs and channels. There are also a large number of channels that only provide mindless entertainment. If we want to benefit from television, we need to choose the programs wisely. There are plenty of informative programs that also provide a reasonable amount of entertainment. For example, the channels Discovery and Animal Planet provide entertainment as well as information. We can learn a lot of things by just watching these channels. Likewise, news channels keep us informed of national and international events. But if we spend the whole day watching the reruns of mega serials, we aren’t going to be any wiser.
For most people, television is merely a tool for obtaining entertainment. They aren’t looking for information. They just want to kill time and that isn’t such a bad thing. There is no harm in using the television as an entertainment tool. We only need to limit the time spent in front of the idiot box. If we set aside enough time for other more important activities like work or studies, television will have no negative impact on us.
To conclude, I neither agree nor disagree with the argument that watching television is good for us. It depends on what we watch and how much we watch. If we limit our screen time and choose the programs and channels wisely, television will be good for us.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-television-is-good-for-us-do-you-agree-or-disagree
1146,"Newspapers affect people’s ideas and opinions. Do you agree or disagree? If you agree, is it a positive or a negative development?","Newspapers are the biggest source of information for the general public. They keep us informed of global events. Newspapers also help shape public opinion. They not only provide news; they also provide views. In my opinion, newspapers have both positive and negative influence on the society.
People get easily influenced by what they read in the newspapers. Most of us trust newspaper reports blindly. We are convinced that if a story appears in the newspaper, then it has to be true. Newspapers have the power to influence people’s thought processes. During India’s freedom struggle, Indian national newspapers played an important role in galvanising public opinion against the colonial establishment in India. This gave momentum to the freedom movement.
Newspapers are important for the success of a democracy. They make sure that politicians remain accountable to the people who send them to the parliament. All of these are examples of the positive influence of newspapers.
On the flip side, journalism is also becoming a business. It is wrong to assume that all newspapers have the noblest intentions. Some widely circulated newspapers are owned by big corporate houses. They misuse the power of newspapers to form public opinion in their favour. As a result, many a time, the voice and concerns of the common man go unheard.
Sensationalism is another problem. Newspapers need readers. For this purpose, they often sensationalise news stories. Some newspapers also try to glamorize the lives of the rich and the famous. This sends out the wrong message to young readers. They assume that life is all about attending parties and wearing designer clothes.
To conclude, newspapers certainly influence people and that influence can be positive or negative. In my opinion, everyone should read at least two newspapers. This will help them get a better understanding of national and international events. Journalists and reporters also need to realize that they have a commitment to the society. People get influenced by their articles and reports. They have to use their pen for the betterment of the society.",7.5,ielts-essay-about-the-influence-of-newspapers-on-the-society
1147,It is better to teach sports to young people at school as an alternative to playing computer games at home. Why is it important? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.,"Sports help the physical and mental development of children. Computer games, on the other hand, only make them lazy and fat. Teaching sports at school is the best way to make young people physically active. Therefore, I certainly agree with the argument that sports should be taught at school.
There are several benefits to attracting young people to sports and games. When they play sports, they become fit physically and mentally. Sports also teach youngsters to deal with both success and failure. That explains why children who play sports have well-rounded personalities.
Young people are falling prey to lifestyle diseases like obesity and diabetes. Most of them lead a sedentary lifestyle. They spend hours in front of the computer and the television. Lack of physical activity makes them obese and fragile. Excessive screen time also affects their eyesight.
If sports are taught compulsorily at school, children will be forced to flex their muscles. Some might resent this at first, but everyone will eventually reap the benefits of sports education. Children who play sports at school may also show a greater interest in playing sports when they reach home. Thus sports will eventually wean them off their gaming consoles and mobile phones.
In cities space comes at a premium. Many children especially those living in cities do not have access to playgrounds. By contrast, most schools have their own playgrounds. If schools set aside an hour a day to teach sports and games, there will be a remarkable improvement in the physical and intellectual development of children.
To conclude, there are several arguments in favour of teaching sports at school. In my opinion, the government should enact laws that make sports education compulsory at school.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-should-sports-be-taught-at-school
1148,Some people think that uniform at school is unnecessary and should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The school uniform serves several practical and beneficial purposes and hence I am against banning it. In this essay I will explain why the uniform must not be banned.
First, uniform helps create community feelings in children. When children wear uniform to school, they feel like they are all part of the same institution. This improves their relationship with one another.
Second, uniform creates a sense of equality. In every school, you will find children coming from different cultural and financial backgrounds. Some students can afford to wear new clothes every day. Some can’t. When everyone – both rich and poor kids – wears the same clothes to school, no one feels superior or inferior. In my opinion, this is the biggest advantage of wearing uniform to school. Clothes can convey a lot of information about a person’s family background. Uniforms, on the other hand, do not reveal these details. This helps the students in many ways. If uniforms are banned and children are allowed to wear whatever they like, students coming from poor families may develop an inferiority complex when their richer classmates arrive in expensive designer wear every day.
Third, the uniform serves as an identity proof. A uniform is much more than a piece of clothing. When students wear uniform, it is easy to recognize which school they belong to. This also creates a sense of brotherhood among students. They feel attached to other students who wear the same uniform.
Finally, students don’t have to waste time thinking what they should wear to school. Uniform helps save time for school authorities as well. They don’t have to worry about students wearing inappropriate clothes to school.
To conclude, there are several benefits to wearing uniform and students should be required to wear it to school. Uniform helps create a sense of equality and community feelings in children.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-should-uniform-be-banned
1149,Nowadays leisure industry products like gaming consoles and modern gadgets are widely used by young people. The use of these products reduces the creativity of the young generation. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion.,"Modern gadgets like smartphones and gaming consoles are quite popular with young people. Many of them make it a point to buy new gadgets as soon they hit the market. Gadget addiction has both destroyed and nourished the creativity of young people. I will explain my stand with examples in this essay.
Young people who spend a lot of time with their gadgets have reduced social skills. They live in a fictitious world of their own and often have trouble building relationships with others. They can’t imagine an existence without their gadgets and get panic attacks if they don’t have access to their machines. These people tend to have poor academic grades. They don’t have time to concentrate on their studies and they have limited understanding of the world around them. Most of these folks don’t read or write. They won’t be able to write even a simple letter if they don’t have access to the internet. In other words, these people will find it difficult to survive if you place them in a world where there is no internet or smartphone.
On the flip side, there are countless youngsters who have used the potential of gadgets and technology to unleash their creativity. They make apps and games. They write blogs to educate and entertain the world. We are living in the midst of a startup boom. If we take a look at those startup founders, it is not hard to see that they are young men and women in their early twenties. They are inspired by the power of technology and want to make a constructive difference to the world. They use their gadgets to change the world.
To conclude, technology can be a bane or a boon. It depends upon the way we use it. Young people need to realize that gadgets aren’t for killing time. They have better uses.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-has-gadgets-affected-the-creativity-of-young-people
1150,Some people think that only staff who worked in a company for a long time should be promoted to higher positions. Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and examples.,"Many organizations, especially those operating in the IT sector, often promote new employees to higher positions provided that they have the skills and expertise. Some people feel that this is not a good idea. In their opinion, only those employees who have stayed with the company for a long time should be promoted to higher positions. I don’t agree with this view.
Experience matters. However, one does not have to work at the same company for several years to gain experience. Experience that one gains by working at other companies is equally relevant. IT companies understand this better than anybody else. In the IT sector poaching is rampant. Companies are vying with one another to attract and retain the best talent. This often involves luring top level executives of a rival company with better pay packets and higher job profiles. This arrangement hasn’t hurt the prospects of these companies in any way. So, I feel that there is no harm in promoting new employees to higher positions if they have experience in the sector.
Perhaps the biggest argument in favor of promoting people who have been with the company for a long time is their loyalty. People tend to be loyal to the company they have worked with for several years. They are also more likely to stick with that organization in the future. While this sounds logical, I don’t think that a company should only promote their old employees to higher positions. Actually, if they have such a policy in place, they will find it rather difficult to attract the best people in the industry.
To conclude, organizations that want to attract the best people should be willing to promote their new employees as well. Previous working experience with the company may be important in some cases, but this is not always required for promotion.",7.5,ielts-essay-should-new-employees-be-promoted-to-higher-positions
1151,"In many countries, the amount of crime is increasing. What do you think are the main causes of crime? How can we deal with those causes? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","We are now living in a materialistic society where human values are dying. Everyone wants to live in palatial homes, drive luxury cars and use the latest gadgets. When people can’t earn enough money to satisfy their cravings for material goodies, they get into crime. Cybercrime, for example, is on the rise. Hackers are actually intelligent people, but instead of using their talents for the betterment of the society, they are breaking computer networks and stealing passwords and credit card numbers to make some quick bucks.
The media also plays an important role in the growth of crime. Movies and television programmes glamourise criminal activities. Youngsters who watch these programmes arrive at the conclusion that being a criminal is fashionable. They get into crime without realizing its consequences.
Parents and teachers can play an important role in controlling crime. They need to keep a tab on their children. If we look at the history of criminals, it is not hard to see that many of them are coming from dysfunctional families where they have none to show them the right path. Reducing unemployment is another solution. A lot of people are compelled to commit crimes because of financial problems. If the government can create more jobs, there will definitely be a drop in the criminal activities. The media too should stop popularizing crime.
To conclude, growing consumerism is the number one cause of crime. However, if parents, teachers, governments and the media make a concerted effort, we will be able to control this growing menace.",7.5,ielts-essay-about-growing-crime-rate
1152,"Some teachers tend to reward students who achieve high academic results. Others, however, support and reward students that show the most improvement.Discuss both approaches and give your opinion.","Most teachers reward high achievers; there are also some who prefer to reward students who show improvement in their studies. In my opinion, both categories of students need to be rewarded.
When toppers are rewarded, it will help them stay motivated. This will improve their performance in the future as well. Awards and prizes encourage students to work harder and harder. That is the main reason they are given in the first place. High achievers also need to be rewarded for their excellent performance. When their teachers and school recognize their hard work by giving them prizes, they will want to get even better results.
Schools have their own reasons to reward best performing students. Every school needs at least a few brilliant students. High achievers help grow the reputation of the school. When students perform well in examinations, their teachers’ hard work is getting recognized. In the same way, when students fare badly, it affects the credentials of the teacher. It is not surprising then that teachers reward students who perform well in tests.
Students who are showing improvement in their studies also need to be rewarded. It will encourage them to work harder. Everyone wants to be recognized for their work. When a student puts in hard work to improve his grades, he needs his teacher’s support and encouragement. If none seems to care, the student may lose his motivation and that might affect his grades again. For teachers, the easiest way to show their appreciation is to reward students with compliments and prizes.
To conclude, all students need to be rewarded for their good work. When high achievers are rewarded it will help them to stay motivated. When students showing improvement are rewarded, it boosts their morale and improves their future performance. In my opinion, schools that only reward the best students should start recognizing the hard work of other students too.",7.5,ielts-essay-about-teachers-rewarding-students
1153,Nowadays children are experiencing too much educational and social pressure. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to reduce the pressure?,"Parents now expect too much from their children. Most of them want their children to get into prestigious institutions and secure jobs with six figure salaries. Consequently children are under tremendous pressure to perform.
For example, in India most parents want their children to get into IITs or secure a medical degree. They don’t care whether the child has aptitude for science or mathematics. They understand that a degree from these prestigious institutions have the potential to change lives for better.
However, parents who expect too much from their children aren’t doing them a service. Students who fail to do well in examinations often fall into depression. Some even commit suicides. They can’t come to terms with the fact that they failed to live up to the expectations of their parents.
The media has played an important role in developing this culture. The media glorifies winners. They are given too much coverage. Thanks to the proliferation of cable television and the internet, every parent now wants their child to be featured on television programs and newspapers. Actually, academic pressure isn’t the only burden on children these days. They are required to excel in extracurricular activities as well. Most children attend singing, dancing and drawing classes. A lot of them receive training in martial arts and musical instruments.
Reality shows are another culprit. Of course, they give talented children a platform to showcase their skills. But they are also putting unwanted stress on children who lack these skills. Not all children are born to be a singer or dancer. Parents need to realize this.
To conclude, unrealistic expectations are the number one cause of stress among children. Parents must be sensitized about this problem. They must realize that children who are under tremendous pressure to perform are unlikely to succeed in school or life.",7.5,ielts-essay-causes-of-excessive-pressure-on-children

How does this affect the children and family life?,"In many families now both parents work. This arrangement has both positive and negative effects. When both parents work, they can ensure the financial security of their family. On the flip side, they get hardly any time for each other or their kids. This can affect family relationships.
Fifty or sixty years ago, few women went to work. Many of them lacked academic qualifications. Even those who possessed degrees were happy to be homemakers. Now the situation has changed. Women have proved their mettle in almost all fields. Many women now possess post graduate degrees. They don’t want to confine themselves to the four walls of their home. They want to work; they want to focus on their career. Also, the cost of living has increased. It is now nearly impossible for a family to survive on a single salary. As a result, in many families both spouses have to work to make a living.
Financial security is desirable, but this arrangement causes many problems in the family. Children who spend their entire day in dare care centres may find it difficult to have a healthy relationship with their parents. Children require their parents’ love and care to grow into successful and responsible adults. If they are alone for most of the time, they may into unhealthy habits. They may also get into bad company. Problems may also arise between the spouses if they don’t have time for each other.
To conclude, in many families it has become a necessity for both parents to work. However, this arrangement has its merits and demerits.

1155,"Some say that advertisements of toys and snacks have a huge impact on children and their parents, and therefore advertising to children should be banned. Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Give your own opinion.","Advertisers target children because they get influenced easily. When they see advertisements of snacks and toys on television they will want those products for themselves. This makes selling easier. Some people believe that marketers must not be allowed to target children. I certainly agree with that view.
Children are too young to distinguish good from bad and right from wrong. They believe all that they see on TV. Manufacturers of fast foods and toys spend a lot of money on advertising their products to children. They only show the positive aspects of their products. Fast foods like instant noodles can cause several health programs. Children don’t understand this. They insist on having those products for breakfast or even lunch and parents are forced to satisfy those cravings. One can’t quite blame the children either. When they see models of their age eating certain foods or playing with certain toys in commercials, they will want those things for themselves. Advertisers know this better than anybody else. That is why they are targeting kids in the first place.
Parents are helpless here. They know such products aren’t good for their children, but they also want to indulge their kids. Today’s nuclear families revolve around the children. Sometimes parents even buy expensive toys that they cannot afford. They want to keep their children happy, no matter what.
To conclude, I certainly agree with the argument that advertisements targeting young children should be banned. It is easy to influence the thought process of kids. Brands should not be allowed to exploit this weakness. When advertisers market their products to children, they aren’t doing anyone except themselves a service.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-advertisements-targeting-young-children-should-be-banned

From toddlers to seniors in their 70s and 80s everyone enjoys sitting in front of the idiot box. In addition to entertaining people, television keeps them informed. There are educational channels and twenty four hour news channels. They operate with the objective of providing education rather than entertainment. Therefore I certainly agree with the argument that television is useful in education.
Television brought entertainment to our living room. There are numerous channels and numerous programs to keep us entertained for hours on end. Actually, a lot of us are addicted to television and now it is nearly impossible to find a home that doesn’t have a television set. Television’s role as a major entertainment tool is well-documented.
Television also plays an important role in disseminating education. There are several channels dedicated to education. They provide information about the latest findings in the field of science, technology archeology and literature. News channels keep us informed of the happenings around us. Since television takes advantage of both audio and video it can have a profound impact on viewers. This makes learning easier. For example, when students watch scientific experiments being performed on the TV, they will be able to understand it better. Learning the theory from textbooks does not have such a profound impact.
Television also makes learning fun. Since television programs use tools such as multimedia and animation, they manage to capture the attention of students for long. Channels like Discovery and National Geographic have played a major role in spreading awareness about wildlife, history, geography and natural phenomena. Watching a science program on Discovery Channel is a lot more interesting than reading textbooks on biology or physics.
To conclude, television has played an important role in imparting education. It provides entertainment as well, but it is wrong to treat it as a medium that provides only entertainment.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-televisions-role-in-education

Give your own opinion and examples.","Home appliances like refrigerators and washing machines have certainly made our lives easier. They are a boon to working couples. Of course, there are a few disadvantages as well.
In many families both spouses work. They can’t even imagine a life without washing machines or refrigerators. After working for hours in the office many people lack the energy or inclination to cook when they reach home. Refrigerators have made lives easier for them by keeping cooked food fresh for a long time. The washing machine is another appliance that has changed our lives. Machines with drying systems are particularly helpful to people living in small apartments where they don’t have enough space to hang and dry clothes.
Of course, every coin has two sides. Technology is no different. It has both positive and negative aspects. Home appliances, for example, are great for saving time. However, they are not exactly good for health. Fresh food is a whole lot healthier than refrigerated food.
The modern society is suffering from many ailments. The main culprit is the sedentary lifestyle that most of us lead. Our grandmothers used to sweep and mop the floors and wash their clothes by hand. They didn’t suffer many of the health problems that we face today. Yes, our lives are more comfortable but most of us also complain of backaches, stiff knees, diabetes and high blood pressure. We will be able to keep many of these diseases at bay by simply leading an active lifestyle. This requires us to reduce our dependence on technology and appliances.
After analyzing both sides of the situation, it is not hard to see that home appliances have both merits and demerits. However, in my opinion, their merits outweigh their demerits. Also, by using them properly and incorporating some physical activity into our daily routine we can get around many of the problems posed by them.",7.5,ielts-essay-about-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-home-appliances
1158,"In many countries traditional food is being replaced by international fast food. This has adverse effects on families, individuals and the society. Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion.","More and more families now subsist on fast foods supplied by international restaurant chains such as KFC and McDonalds. In fact, many families have forgotten the art of traditional cooking. In my opinion, this is a negative trend with far reaching consequences.
The food that we eat plays an important role in keeping us healthy. Home-cooked traditional food is healthier than restaurant food for many reasons. Traditional cooking methods are developed by communities over a long period of time. There are several benefits to sticking to this style of cooking. To start with, foods prepared in traditional ways keep us healthier. Also, traditional cooking uses locally grown ingredients. This eliminates the need to import fruits or vegetables from far-away places.
The fast food culture has not only caused health problems but also killed the family bonding over meals. When families sit around a table enjoying a meal, it strengthens relationships. Nowadays in many families children and adults just sit in front of the TV and eat from fast food packets held in their hands. This does not help their health or their equation with others in the family.
Fast food consumption has several implications on the society as well. The prosperity of a society depends upon the health and well-being of its people. When people develop health problems because of their bad eating habits, the government and medical insurance companies will have to cough up huge amounts of money to cover their medical expenses. The government will pass that cost on to the public by increasing taxes.
To conclude, societies all over the world are falling prey to the fast food culture. This has several negative implications. It is high time the government and the media created awareness about this growing menace.",7.5,ielts-essay-traditional-food-is-being-replaced-by-international-fast-food
1159,"Some people think that economic growth is the only way to stop world’s poverty and hunger, while others say that economic growth is the cause of environmental disasters. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Over seven billion people inhabit the earth today. Without economic development, it would be impossible to feed them all. It is true that industrialization which drives economic growth also leads to several environmental problems. This, however, does not mean that we should forsake economic development to protect the environment. Instead, we should develop eco-friendly technologies.
It is impossible to eradicate poverty without economic development. Poverty and hunger are the biggest problems that people face in economically backward countries. Industrialization is the only solution to this problem. Industrialization helps create jobs and alleviate property. Employed people have improved purchasing power. They can feed and clothe their family.
On the flip side, industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution. Factories emit poisonous gases into the atmosphere. This causes air pollution and several health problems. When factories dumb industrial waste into oceans and rivers, it results in water pollution. Excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides not only causes soil pollution but also leads to several illnesses in human beings.
Besides causing health problems, environmental pollution upsets the balance of our ecosystem. Global warming has become a major problem all over the world. Climate change causes floods in one part of the world and droughts in other parts. In fact, today environmental problems threaten the very existence of life on this planet. This is not something that we can ignore.
To conclude, we need both development and a clean environment. We can’t sacrifice one for another. This wouldn’t be possible without investing in sustainable technologies. Governments and big organizations must encourage research into the development of eco-friendly technologies. Spreading awareness about the impact of environmental problems is equally important.",7.5,ielts-about-economic-development-and-environmental-problems
1160,"In Britain, when someone gets old they often go to live in a home with other old people where there are nurses to look after them. Sometimes the government has to pay for this care.","In Britain, when people age they go to senior care homes where they live under the care of trained care providers. In most cases, the government pays for this care. Some people believe that the family of the elderly person should be required to pay for his or her expenses. However, in my opinion, it should depend on the financial status of the person receiving care.
First of all, let’s assess the factors that force seniors to go to care homes. Many of them are alone and have none to take care of them at home. In many families both spouses work. In this situation, they may find it difficult to care for their parents and consequently they send them to care homes.
Britain also has a large number of single parent households. Many single parents are struggling hard to make both ends meet and hence they don’t have the financial means to support their parents. Families with children, in particular, have more financial liabilities. Senior care, after all, is not cheap. In addition to this, some seniors require specialist care. Many families are incapable of providing this on their own. While it is possible to hire an in-home care provider, it can be quite expensive.
In my opinion, the government certainly has a responsibility to take care of its elderly people. When they were young, they all worked and contributed towards the welfare of the nation. When they are old, the government has to return the favour. However, families that can pay for this care should be required to do so. It should be free for others.
To conclude, the government should take care of the elderly who can’t afford to hire an in-home care provider.",7.5,ielts-essay-who-should-pay-for-senior-care
1161,It is a fact that people nowadays are under a lot of pressure and their lives are becoming increasingly stressful. What could be the possible reasons for this? What are some solutions to address this issue?,"Stress has become part and parcel of our lives. Even young children lead stressful lives these days. Increasing competition is the number one cause of stress. Everybody wants to achieve more and more. They want to do better than their peers. People are never happy with what they have. This perpetual struggle to do better than one’s peers leads to stress and causes many health problems.
The modern society glorifies workaholism. Employees are forced to burn the midnight oil to meet crazy deadlines. Cut throat competition exists in the job market and if one isn’t willing to stretch oneself thin, one can get laid off. Most people have several financial liabilities. Getting laid off is the last thing they want to happen to them. So, they work harder and harder. They don’t find time for their family or themselves.
Social media also plays a role in causing stress. People post exotic images of their holidays and rant about their expensive acquisitions on social media. They have just one mission – they want to show that their lives are actually better than the lives of others. This makes their friends feel inadequate.
Perhaps the biggest problem that plagues our world is the pursuit of material gains. We equate happiness with cars, villas and foreign vacations.
In my opinion, the only way to beat stress is to look for meaning in life. Instead of rushing after material gains, we should look inward and connect with our true nature. Setting priorities is equally important. We should ask ourselves what we want to achieve in our lives. Once we have a clear idea of our goals, we can toil towards them at our own pace. This approach actually makes our lives a lot less stressful.",7.5,ielts-essay-about-the-causes-of-stress
1162,Why do you think teachers give homework to students? How important is it for students to have homework? Perhaps homework should be abolished. Give your opinion about this. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge and experience.,"Teachers give homework to ensure that students revise their lessons at home. This aids the process of learning. However, if too much homework is given, it will put students under tremendous pressure and affect their performance in school. This, however, does not mean that homework should be abolished. Instead, teachers should be advised to give less homework so that students will have enough time to engage in activities that keep them relaxed and entertained.
A lot of parents support homework but that is not surprising. Students who complete their homework seem to have better grades. This clearly shows that homework helps children assimilate the knowledge they acquired from school. Homework also encourages students to complete their work neatly and correctly within the timeframe allotted. This will definitely help them to grow into disciplined adults who can meet deadlines.
On the flip side, the practice of giving homework has its disadvantages. Now many teachers burden students with excessive homework. They forget that students need time to play with their friends, watch television or go out with their parents. Children spend several hours in the classroom. They need a break from books at least when they reach home. Many students now stay up late to complete their homework. When they reach school the next day they find it difficult to concentrate on their studies. This affects their academic performance.
There is yet another argument against excessive homework. Academic performance cannot be the only yardstick of excellence. Children need to develop well-rounded personalities. This wouldn’t be possible if they do not get time to focus on extra-curricular activities.
To conclude, I don’t think that abolishing homework will help students or teachers. Homework helps children master several skills they need for success in life. However, teachers need to ensure that they are not burdening students with excessive work.",7.5,ielts-essay-should-children-be-given-homework
1163,"In the past people used to wear traditional clothes. Today, people all over the world wear the same kind of clothes. Is it a positive or negative development?","Western clothes like shirts, trousers, coats and skirts are popular all over the world. They have replaced traditional costumes. Personally, I believe that this is a positive development. It has reduced discrimination based on clothing, boosted the economy and bought comfort to our lives.
Perhaps the huge popularity of western clothes can be attributed to the fact that they can be worn by all people. They are versatile and look good on most people. Also these clothes can be worn by both men and women.
There are several benefits to wearing western clothes. First of all, people who wear western clothes face less discrimination. They do not represent any country or ethnicity from their clothes. For instance, Chinese, Japanese or Koreans, all look alike if they are wearing western style. Thus, to a certain extent uniformity of clothing has protected people from discrimination.
Secondly, when people all over the world wear the same kind of clothes, it leads to economic growth because all brands can sell similar styles. This helps small exporters from India or Bangladesh to compete with large clothing companies in the US or the UK.
There is yet another benefit to wearing the same kind of clothes. You can buy them from anywhere in the world. As a result, people who live or travel abroad do not have to carry a lot of clothes with them when they leave their mother country.
To sum up, there are several benefits to wearing clothes of the same kind. I also believe that uniformity of clothing improves our inner confidence.",7.5,ielts-essay-about-people-wearing-clothes-of-same-kind
1164,Do you think consumers should avoid over packaged products or is it the responsibility of the manufacturer to avoid over packaging? Give your views and also some examples from your own experience.,"Over packaging is a clever tactic that many manufacturers employ to make their products look more attractive. Since consumers get drawn to beautifully packaged items, over packaging may help sell more products. Some manufacturers also employ this technique to hide the flaws of their products. It is true that manufacturers have a responsibility to avoid over packaging. But in my opinion, they are unlikely to stop this practice until consumers stop buying over packaged products.
Over packaging is not a benign practice. It does not help anyone except the manufacturer. Over packaging hurts the consumer and the environment. Wastefully packaged boxes take up a lot more space than necessary in shipping trucks. As a result, to carry the same amount of cargo, trucks have to make more trips. This results in the wastage of energy, materials and manpower.
All the materials used for packaging will eventually end up in landfills. This creates a serious problem for the environment. Over packaging may lead to deforestation, global warming and air pollution.
Paper is still the most common material used for packaging. Each year tens of thousands of trees are being cut down to create packaging materials. Plastic is also used for packaging. The environmental impact of plastic is well-known. It is sad that companies still haven’t woken up to the dangers of over packaging and resort to such practices to sell their products.
To conclude, over packaging is not something that should be encouraged. While it might seem to be a benign practice, it has negative impacts on the environment. Consumers have to stop buying over packaged products. Only then will manufacturers take notice and stop shipping their items in large almost empty packets.

1165,"People should work a fixed number of hours per week, and employers should not ask anybody to work more than this. Do you agree or disagree?","Sample essay
The modern workplace has become increasingly demanding. In many organizations, employees are made to work for long hours to achieve more in less time. In my opinion, this practice should not be encouraged. In this essay, I will analyse how long working hours affect employees.
Firstly, working for long hours on a regular basis stresses employees who are already under pressure to complete the tasks assigned to them. Take, for instance, the case of professionals working in the Indian software industry. These people are always under pressure because of their tighter delivery schedules. They don’t get enough sleep or rest. As a result many of them suffer from chronic fatigue, backache, and migraine. Staring at the computer for long hours affects their eyesight.
Another impact of working overtime is the early onset of diseases in younger people. More and more young working individuals in developing countries like India and China are suffering from diabetes and cardiac diseases. Since youngsters are spending more time at the workplace, they don’t get time to exercise. Many of them subsist on junk food. This is particularly true in the case of working couples. When both of them work overtime, they don’t have the time or interest to cook meals at home. As a result, they eat out and develop many health problems over time. Work life balance is another problem faced by overworked employees.
To conclude working overtime has a negative impact on employees and their families. Employers should realize that they cannot increase productivity by asking their employees to spend long hours at the workplace. In fact, stressed out employees are not very productive and cannot do justice to their jobs.",7.5,ielts-essay-sample-employees-should-not-be-asked-to-work-overtime
1166,The usage of Credit cards and Debit cards seems to be a growing trend. Will plastic money completely replace the currency notes and coins used at present? Do you think this is a positive development?,"The popularity of credit and debit cards has increased tremendously over the years. This is definitely a positive development because cards have eliminated the need to carry cash in our wallets. However, I don’t expect cards to replace paper currency in the near future.
If credit and debit cards are popular, that is because they are very convenient. Carrying huge amounts of cash in one’s wallet is not very safe. Cards eliminate this need. What’s more, credit cards allow people to buy things even if they don’t have any balance in their bank accounts. Cards have also made online transactions possible. If there were no credit cards, the e-commerce industry would not develop at this pace.
On the flip side, data security is a concern when you make payments using your cards. Hackers are after your credit card details and security breaches can wipe the entire amount in your bank accounts. However, banks and card companies are working hard to fix this problem. And thanks to security measures like two-factor identification card payments have become much safer over the years. Still, I don’t think that cards will completely replace cash.
Many small businesses do not have the technology required to accept cash payments. If you buy things from a roadside vendor you will have to pay cash. I don’t think that they will be in a position to accept cards any time soon. In addition, we are emotionally attached to paper currency. This may also prevent the total adoption of cards.
To conclude, the growing popularity of credit and debit cards is indeed a positive development. However, even today security concerns prevent many people from making card payments. This might change in the future, but until everyone has the facility to accept cards, they are not going to replace traditional currency.",7.5,ielts-essay-will-credit-cards-replace-traditional-currency
1167,Nowadays many people work part or full time from home. Some people say that working from home has many benefits while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"The argument that freelancing affects a person’s financial security is true to a certain extent. Freelancers do not have a mixed monthly income. They will make money only if they find good projects. Also, the demand for freelancers does not always remain the same. For example, a few years ago, there was a major crisis in the IT industry. Since the IT sector is the biggest provider of freelance jobs, many freelancers did not have any projects for several months. This had a serious impact on their financial situation. If people are employed with an organization, they will receive a raise every year. They may also get a promotion if they deliver good performance.
On the other hand, freelancing has several advantages. Thanks to the flexible hours, freelancers manage to achieve better work-life balance. Also, they can decide how much they should charge for a project. Many freelancers are paid on an hourly basis. So if they work long hours, they will be able to earn more money. In addition, freelancers do not have to work under the supervision of a boss. A bad boss can seriously affect the productivity of an employee. People even leave organizations because of their dissatisfaction with the management. But when you freelance you don’t have a boss constantly breathing down on your neck. For many freelancers, this freedom is the biggest draw.
To conclude, freelancing has both positive and negative aspects. However, it is not hard to see that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, this trend will grow in popularity in the coming years.",7.5,ielts-essay-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-freelancing
1168,University students should pay for their own education instead of the society or government funding their studies. After all their education benefits them more than it benefits the society. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion.,"Some people believe that students should pay their fees themselves instead of expecting the government to fund their studies. In their opinion, young graduates are more interested in achieving their personal goals than working for the welfare of the society. I beg to differ. In my opinion, youngsters do care for the society.
Students may benefit the society in many ways. Many of them engage in voluntary work. Even school children work for NGOs. Young graduates who find good jobs also help the society. They often help their juniors with career planning. Some even help needy students with monetary assistance. What’s more, over the years there has been a dramatic fall in the number of emigrants. This is a clear sign that more and more youngsters now want to work for the society that funded their education.
There would be an increase in crime if the government did not fund higher education. Without government funding many students would not be able to continue their studies. They may get into illegal activities. They might even indulge in robbery, theft and substance abuse. To further illustrate this, I would like to give an example. In some parts of North India there was an increase in crime when students stopped receiving government aid for continuing their studies.
To sum up, we have seen what would happen if the government stopped funding higher education. It is true that not all students who received funding work for the welfare of the society, but most of them do. Without government funding, many students will not be able to afford higher education. This will lead to unemployment and an increase in crime. Therefore, I firmly believe that government should fund university studies.",7.5,band-9-essay-sample-should-governments-fund-higher-education
1169,"Giving lectures in auditoriums to large numbers of students is an old way of teaching. With the technology available today there is no justification for it, and everything should be done online. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion.","Technology has changed every aspect of our life including the way we learn and teach. Nowadays it is possible to earn degrees online. Online forums allow you to ask questions on any topic and receive answers within a matter of minutes. However, I still believe that online education cannot replace classroom based learning and teaching.
Online learning has its advantages. You can learn from the comforts of your home. The flexible learning hours are a boon for people who can’t afford to spend 6 or 7 hours in the classroom. Also, the internet has made it possible for learners to find teachers from any part of the world. So, for example, a student who wants to learn Spanish can find Spanish teachers online and learn from her home. She doesn’t have to go to Spain or find an institution that teaches Spanish in her country.
Online learning has its disadvantages too. Since there is no one to supervise your work or evaluate your progress you need a great amount of motivation and discipline to complete your course successfully. Distractions are a real problem for students doing online programs.
By contrast, classroom learning does not have many of these drawbacks. The best thing about classroom learning is that it creates an ambiance conducive to learning. In a class you are surrounded by other students who also want to score higher grades. This encourages you to work harder. In addition, subjects like medicine and engineering cannot be taught online because the emphasis is on practical not theory.
To conclude, online learning may have its benefits, but I still feel that classroom learning is superior to online learning. That said, the internet and information technology has endless possibilities. Both students and teachers will benefit a lot if they take advantage of the power of the internet in the classroom.",7.5,band-9-essay-sample-online-learning-is-better-than-classroom-learning-do-you-agree
1170,Schools don’t do enough to teach students about their health. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Many students now subsist on junk food. Over the last few years, there has been a steady increase in the number of students battling lifestyle diseases like obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. Biology textbooks do have lessons that teach students about health. But I really don’t think that schools are doing much to encourage students to lead a healthy lifestyle.
In many schools, junk food is served in the canteen. Children love them and eat them. Schools that are truly interested in developing good eating habits in children should banish these junk items from their canteen. There is no point in teaching the importance of eating well in the classroom and serving unhealthy food items in the canteen.
Teachers, too, often fail to set a good example. In many schools in Mumbai they insist that children only bring home-cooked food in their lunch box. However, this rule is not always enforced. Teachers don’t even bother to check what students have brought in their lunch box. Parents, too, should be blamed for this. They are busy and don’t have the time or the willingness to prepare proper meals. So, they send store-bought packaged items in the lunch box despite knowing that these foods contain high levels of sodium, preservatives and additives.
Physical education is also largely neglected. Many schools are only interesting in increasing the academic performance of their students. Even if there are dedicated hours for physical training, often they are not utilized properly. Also, schools put too much emphasis on homework. Children don’t get time to play even after they reach home because they have to complete their homework.
To conclude, I don’t think that schools are doing enough to make students health conscious. Yes, most schools have dedicated a few hours for physical training, but I don’t believe that they are being utilized properly. If schools were giving due importance to health education, obesity and other lifestyle diseases would not be so rampant among young children.",7.5,ielts-essay-schools-dont-give-enough-importance-to-health-education
1171,"Shopping is becoming more and more popular as a leisure activity. However, some people feel that this has both positive and negative effects.","Thanks to growing consumerism, the number of people who shop for fun and pleasure is on the rise. This is a direct consequence of intensive marketing efforts employed by companies. In my opinion, this trend has both positive and negative impacts on people and societies.
Marketers have been studying human psychology to determine the factors that convince people to buy more. They spend millions of dollars on advertising to encourage people to splurge and feel good about doing so.
This sharp increase in shopping activity has both good and bad repercussions. Many people now work long hours and earn handsome salaries. They want to feel rewarded for all those hours spent at the workplace and often go on a shopping spree.
There is no harm in buying new things but if people don’t balance their emotions and gain control over their desires, they will soon find themselves in deep debts. Credit cards have made borrowing easier, but they are a big trap.
The skyrocketing shopping activity is good for the society in many ways. It results in healthy economic activity. This creates the right environment where young entrepreneurs can implement their creative ideas.
On the other end of the spectrum, excessive shopping creates a society of haves and have-nots. Not everybody can afford to buy new items that hit the market. When people who have the money to splurge begin to show off their new possessions, it will create an inferiority complex in others who cannot afford to buy them. They might even feel compelled to make money in whatever way they can. This can cause an increase in crime. It may also strain relationships.
In short, the rise in shopping is due to excessive advertising. While this trend has a few positive effects on the people, it has several drawbacks as well. In my opinion, people should only buy items that they really need.",7.5,ielts-essay-shopping-for-fun
1172,Some people believe that media should be allowed to publish information about the private lives of famous people. Others say that everybody has a right to privacy and this practice must be controlled or even stopped. Discuss both views.,"We are living in a celebrity obsessed world where everything that famous people do or say makes headlines. If media publishes stories about the private lives of the rich and the famous, that is because there is an audience for them. People want to know what celebrities do, say, wear, eat and drink. Media merely satisfies this need because it makes sound business sense for them.
Public personalities also have a private life that they want to shield from others. Just because they are famous, the media doesn’t have the right to publish all sorts of personal information about them. It has now become fashionable to publish photos and stories that are demeaning to famous people. This trend must be condemned. Everybody has flaws; however, when a celebrity exhibits them it becomes news. People get some weird pleasure from knowing that these famous men and women that they admire are not perfect.
On the flip side, there is a symbiotic relationship between celebrities and the media. One depends on the other for their existence. Celebrities need media exposure to remain celebrities. They are desperate to stay in the news. They need media attention to build their career. They become conscious of their right to privacy only after they have established themselves in the industry. At that stage, however, they can’t expect the media, which fuelled their growth, to stop writing about them.
To conclude, as long as people want to know about the private lives of famous personalities, media will oblige them with photos and stories. However, I believe that public personalities also have a right to privacy. Although I wouldn’t say that media should stop writing about famous people, I do believe that they should draw a line. Media must resist the temptation to publish stories that can destroy lives and careers.

1173,In the past people used to live their entire life in one place. Nowadays they live in several different places during their life. What are the reasons for this change? Is it a positive or a negative trend?,"Before the advent of industrialization, people used to spend their entire lives in one place. In fact, there was hardly any reason to move about. Agriculture was the backbone of the economy and farmers cultivated the land close to the place where they lived. Most of them also reared livestock. Because of these reasons they had to stay in the same place throughout the year.
The situation is quite different now. Plenty of jobs are available in the cities and this has encouraged rural people to leave their homes and migrate to urban areas. While agriculture still sustains many economies, more jobs are available in other sectors.
Fewer means of transportation existed one or two centuries ago. This also limited people’s ability to move about. But now we can travel by land, air and water. Trains and aeroplanes have made long distance travel quite easy and affordable. The ease of traveling also encourages people to move to different places. Villagers migrate to cities in search of jobs and a better standard of living. People also travel for pleasure.
This is definitely a positive trend because it makes our lives more interesting. When we live in different places we get to interact with people of different cultures. We get to learn from them. This will broaden the horizons of our thinking and also make us more tolerant. People who live in the same place tend to have a limited understanding of the world around them. On the other hand, those who have lived in different places are more knowledgeable.
To conclude, industrialization and improved means of transportation are the factors that encourage people to move about. This is definitely a positive trend because it fosters cultural mingling.

1174,"Some people believe that modern technology has made printed books, newspapers and magazines unimportant. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is true that technological innovations like computers and the internet have made books and newspapers less important. When people can find all information online, they have hardly any incentive to buy books or magazines. This, however, does not mean that books have lost all of their relevance. In my opinion, books are still relevant to a certain extent.
Billions of people living in many parts of the world still do not have access to the internet. They need magazines and newspapers to know what is happening around the world. Books are easy on the eye. Computers can lead to several visual problems. Young children, in particular, should not be allowed to stare at a computer for hours on end.
There is no denying the fact that internet has made information readily available at our fingertips. Gone are the days when students had to frequent libraries to find information for their research projects. In addition, most of the information available online is free and can be accessed by anyone who owns a computer and an internet connection.
Books and magazines, on the other hand, are not free. They are not exactly environment friendly either. Paper is made from wood and to make paper, you have to cut trees. Also books have a short shelf life. Although they can last decades, they are not indestructible. By contrast, information posted online will be there for all eternity. Also portable mobile devices like tablets and laptops eliminate the need to go about classrooms luging heavy books.
It is not hard to see that information technology has made books and newspapers less important. This, however, does not mean that they have become totally irrelevant. A lot of people begin their day reading their favourite newspaper. To conclude, books and magazines may have lost some of their relevance, but it is impossible to claim that technology has made them redundant.",7.5,band-9-essay-sample-printed-books-and-magazines-have-lost-their-importance
1175,Nowadays online shopping becomes more popular than in-store shopping. Is it a positive or a negative development? Give your reasons and examples.,"Now that we can buy just about anything with a few mouse clicks from the comfort of our home, very few people actually feel the need to venture into brick and mortar stores. There is no denying the fact that online shopping has become more popular than in-store shopping. This trend has both positive and negative aspects.
The huge popularity of online shopping can be attributed to the fact that it makes shopping easier. It saves both time and money. Buyers no longer have to drive all the way to shops to buy things. Also, online stores tend to offer attractive prices probably because they have lower overhead costs. This allows them to sell items for deeply discounted prices. This can lead to major cost benefits for shoppers. In addition, online shopping makes it easy to buy things from any part of the world. Even if an item is not available in your country, you can buy it from online stores. Online shopping also allows you to compare prices before hitting the purchase button.
On the flip side, the ease of online shopping has made many people compulsive shoppers. Most of us spend lots of time on the internet every day. And while we are on the internet, we get bombarded with numerous advertisements. For a compulsive shopper, this is a good reason to splurge. The fact that online shopping encourages us to buy things that we do not need or use cannot be denied. This can lead to debts. Also, there are security concerns. When you buy things online, you run a small risk of getting your financial information exploited by hackers. Of course, good anti-virus and anti-malware programs can offer a great deal of protection. But almost every week, we hear about data breaches at major online retailers.
To conclude, online shopping has several advantages and disadvantages. However, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

1176,Parents should teach children about the importance of money. Do you agree or disagree. Give your own reasons and include examples from your knowledge and experience.,"There is no denying the fact that money plays a crucial role in our lives. Children are too young to fully understand the value of money or its significance in our lives. However, it still makes sense for parents to make them money wise from an early age.
Habits learned during childhood will stay with them for the rest of their lives. So, if parents can teach children how important it is for them to use their money wisely, they will become responsible spenders as they grow up.
Money may or may not be the root cause of all evil, but the truth is that we can’t live without money. Little children ask for just about everything they see. They don’t understand the financial difficulties involved in obtaining the objects of their fancy. They don’t understand the hard work their parents put in to earn the money necessary to provide them a comfortable living. By teaching children about the importance of money, parents can foster a sense of appreciation in them.
Parents can teach the importance of money in several ways. They can take the children along when they go shopping. This simple act teaches them that if they need something, they have to pay for it. Parents can cultivate saving habits in their children by gifting them a piggy bank where they can deposit their pocket money. Giving children monetary rewards for doing simple tasks around the house is another way of making them money wise. For example, if the children help dad in the garage or mom in the garden, parents can reward their time and effort by giving them a few pennies. This helps children learn many valuable lessons. They learn that to earn they have to work hard. This also helps them appreciate the value of labor.
I wasn’t raised by rich parents, but they were responsible people who knew how to live within their means. When we were kids, we didn’t have many luxuries. My parents, nonetheless, worked hard and made sure that we led a comfortable life and received the best education. It was the wise spending habits that I learned from my parents during my childhood that stood by me when I started living on my own.
To conclude, parents should teach children about money. This helps them acquire many life skills which will stand them in good stead when they start living on their own. Children who are involved in the financial matters of the family from an early age learn to appreciate their parents’ hard work. They also recognize the importance of spending money wisely.",7.5,ielts-essay-parents-should-teach-children-about-money
1177,Some people believe that money brings happiness; others are of the opinion that having too much money is a problem. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Almost all of us are motivated by money. The only reason that most of us spend 8 to 10 hours at the workplace is to earn money. Money probably doesn’t bring happiness, but not having enough money to take care of our basic needs will seriously limit our happiness. No one wants to live in poverty and no one will lend to the poor.
Money helps us lead a comfortable life. It helps us provide the best possible education for our children. It ensures that our near and dear ones have access to medical attention whenever they need it.
Having more money than you need is unlikely to increase your levels of happiness, but not having enough will definitely destroy your peace of mind.
There is a limit to the amount of money that we can spend on ourselves. Still, the richest among us have amassed wealth they or their progeny will never use in their lifetime. Still, they aren’t satisfied. They want more. That is the lure of money. It never makes people content. Those who don’t have it want to have it. Those who have it want to have even more of it. Unfortunately, in our pursuit of riches, we often forget to live. We forget to appreciate the little joys that make our lives worth living.
Having a lot of money is definitely a problem. It even threatens our safety and security and makes us the target of thieves. Look at the richest people. They can’t move around freely like you or I. They are always surrounded by their personal security guards and often live their entire lives in constant fear of getting attacked.
To conclude, money is unlikely to make us happy, but we must still earn enough. However, in our pursuit of riches, we must not lose our souls. True happiness comes from spiritual awakening. Money has hardly anything to do with it.

1178,Our grandparents think that the way they lived their lives was simpler and better than the way we live our lives. Do you agree or disagree? Support your arguments with examples.,"Modern life is more comfortable, but it is also equally stressful. We invented several devices in the last few decades to make our lives better and more comfortable. However, a vast majority of these inventions also make our life stressful. Take, for instance, the case of cellphones and internet. They allow us to stay connected all the time. Unfortunately, the same connectivity prevents us from taking a break. Organizations now expect their employees to be accessible round the clock despite knowing that this could stress them out.
A few decades ago, however, people led simpler lives. They spent less time at work and had more time for themselves. They had fewer worries and were healthier both mentally and physically. Our grandmothers didn’t have washing machines, refrigerators or vacuum cleaners. So they had to cook, clean and wash with their hands. It made them physically active. In those days, there were fewer vehicles on the road and people often walked to walk. The air was cleaner. Consequently our grandparents enjoyed better health than us. Today we have more effective medicines and treatment options, but unfortunately our stressful and sedentary lifestyles make us more prone to developing many health problems.
On the other hand, our grandparents didn’t lead a simple life because they enjoyed it. They had no other choice. If they had access to the amenities that we enjoy today, they, too, would embrace them gladly. What’s more, if somebody really wants to lead a simple life, it is still possible. One can cut off oneself from the world and live in blissful tranquility. So it is essentially a matter of preference.
In conclusion, it is true that our grandparents led simpler lives and in many ways their lives were better than ours. However, not many of us want to lead that sort of lives today. Today, we are addicted to technology and comfort and very few people will willingly forsake them and adopt simplicity.

1179,"Workers should retire at the age of 60 or 65. However, some people say that the retirement age should be increased and workers should be allowed to work as long as they want. Discuss.","Employees dread the word retirement and that is hardly surprising. When they retire they lose a regular source of income. This loss of income might even make them feel worthless. However, this is no justification for increasing the retirement age.
The number of available jobs at any given time is limited. If aging employees are allowed to work as long as they want, youngsters will have a tough time finding jobs. Since youngsters are much more productive than aged people, this is not advisable. It is a well-known fact that a person’s productivity decreases as he/she ages. People aged 60 or above are likely to be plagued by many health problems. This could cause them to take days off work. They also lack many skills that jobs require. For example, many people in their sixties and seventies have difficulty using computers or internet.
In other words, there is no justification for retaining 60 plus employees when young and better-qualified people are ready to occupy their position. An organization that has a large number of young people on its payroll is likely to be more productive than an organization where the majority of workers are sixty plus.
On the flip side, people become wiser as they age. Aged employees may be able to take more mature decisions than their younger counterparts. They also have decades of experience behind them. If they stop working after they reach 60 or 65, it is sheer wastage of knowledge acquired over decades. Therefore, it is advisable that governments and companies design special employment schemes for older people. Their knowledge and experience could be used to train fresh employees. Retired people can also start something on their own. Since they have the financial resources and necessary contacts they should be able to do this.
In conclusion, increasing the retirement age is not practical because it will adversely affect an organization’s productivity. It will also increase unemployment. Instead of increasing the retirement age, governments need to design special employment schemes that fully utilize the knowledge and experience of retirees.",7.5,ielts-essay-should-retirement-age-be-increased
1180,The best way of motivating workers is to offer them performance-based pay packets. Do you agree or disagree?,"Performance-based incentives and pay packets motivate employees to work harder. Many companies already employ this technique and have reaped huge benefits. Although this is a fair method of rewarding talent, it does have some negative aspects as well.
Performance-based payment systems tend to work best in the sales and marketing sector because quantifying the performance of a salesman is easy. You just need to look at the volume of sales that he or she achieves. However, assessing the performance of a back office employee is not that easy. Although their service is equally important, their contribution to the organization cannot be measured that easily.
The best thing about performance-based pay is that it promotes healthy competition among the workers. When employees realize that they can earn much more than they typically do by achieving more sales, they will definitely work harder. If the incentives only reach a certain number of employees, it will spur everyone to work harder.
On the flip side, incentives may also breed resentment. In every organization, there are both achievers and under-performers. Interestingly, they all put in the same amount of work and time. However, the incentives will only reach the hands of those achievers. This could cause resentment among other employees and make them feel that their contribution is not appreciated.
While thoughtfully designed incentive schemes may encourage employees to stick to an organization, it may also prompt under-performers to quit. While companies are unlikely to feel the need to retain under-performers a high attrition rate does not reflect well on the company or its management. What’s more, organizations spend a great deal of time and money on training fresh employees. If a large number of these employees leave within a few months of joining, it is a sheer wastage of money and manpower.
In conclusion, performance-based incentives encourage hard work and healthy competition among employees. However, the same system may also cause resentment and hamper team efforts. Also in sectors where performance cannot be measured in terms of figures, this method simply wouldn’t work.",7.5,ielts-essay-performance-based-pay-packets-encourage-employees-to-work-harder-do-you-agree
1181,"Some people think that traveling helps us to gain knowledge, but others believe that TV and internet are better sources of knowledge and information. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There is no denying the fact that traveling helps us to gain knowledge. People who have traveled extensively tend to be a whole lot more knowledgeable than people who have lived all their lives in one place. That is probably because traveling exposes us to various experiences and experiences make us wiser.
Of course, traveling is not the only means of acquiring knowledge. With the advent of television and internet, we can now access all the information from the comforts of our home. Television programs allow people to go through a virtual tour of the whole universe. The truth is that people no longer have to step outside their home to explore the world and gain knowledge.
This, however, doesn’t necessarily mean that traveling has lost its significance. In fact, the number of people who travel are steadily on the rise. Interestingly, nearly all of them have access to television and internet. Despite having access to these modern means of information, people still travel and that is clearly an indication that traveling has not lost its popularity. In fact, television prompts people to travel further. They watch interesting places on TV and then decide to travel to those places.
The best thing about traveling is that it allows us to experience things first hand. And knowledge gained through experience is not forgotten easily. Of course, we can’t visit all the countries in the world just for the sake of gaining knowledge. If knowledge acquisition is our goal, we need to make use of all available sources of information including TV, internet and newspapers.
In conclusion, knowledge can be gained through different sources. It is not possible to say that knowledge gained through one source is better than knowledge gained through another source. In the olden days, reading and traveling were the most popular means of gaining knowledge. They are still important. But now other sources of information are also becoming more and more popular.",7.5,ielts-essay-is-television-a-better-source-of-information-than-traveling
1182,Restoration of old buildings involves enormous expenditure. Some people believe that this money should be used to build new housing structures. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Building restoration is a responsible way of using resources because it involves the preservation of what we have already built. Of course, restoration can sometimes be expensive. Still, it is better than building altogether new structures.
Restoration also helps preserve our heritage. Old buildings often have a story to tell. They are windows to the past. When we restore a building, we are preserving our heritage and a part of our history.  The major cost involved in restoration is the cost of labour and that is the best thing about it. Restoration creates jobs and improves local economy without further depleting our natural resources.
Building a new house requires a lot of materials including wood, bricks, steel, cement and sand. When new buildings mushroom in cities and towns, we lose forests. Sand mining has caused the death of many a river. When sand beds disappear rivers lose their ability to retain water. And when rivers dry out, water scarcity occurs. This can lead to the loss of crops and cattle and has become quite an issue in many countries.
What’s more, when new buildings are built after demolishing old buildings, we need to dispose of the cement and concrete. Failure to do so will lead to a major environmental issue. Of course, some buildings cannot be restored. Also in cities where space is an issue there is a need to demolish old and dilapidated structures and create new high rises. This is necessary to provide housing to a large number of people. Restoration is not advisable in this case.
In conclusion, restoration can be expensive but it must be promoted because it does not leave a negative impact on the environment. Building new structures should be permitted only in cases where restoration is not possible.",7.5,ielts-essay-restoration-of-old-buildings-is-expensive
1183,Teenagers are increasingly becoming drug addicts. What are the causes of this unhealthy development? Suggest some measures to fight this menace.,"The lack of parental attention and affection is one the main reasons that drive teenagers to becoming drug addicts. When both the husband and the wife pursue their respective careers, they have little time for their children. Of course families where both parents work are richer but unfortunately, children raised in such families often feel neglected by their parents.
Money and material comforts are no substitutes for love and care. Children who have ample time at their disposal when they come home from school or college generally take to drugs in order to pass time or to experiment. Before they even realize it, they become addicted to drugs and at that stage nothing can be done to bring them back to normalcy.
Education, too, has become a business these days. Schools and teachers often fail to act as guardians of the children entrusted to their care. In such a scenario students are often influenced by the anti-social elements in and around their centres of learning.
Films, internet and other forms of visual media are also responsible for this growing menace. Films and television programs often glorify such dangerous habits as drug addiction. When their favourite heroes indulge in such activities on screen, children wrongly assume that it is all right to do drugs.
I would, therefore, suggest that parents and teachers act more responsible towards their children and students. Parents should know who their children interact with and keep a close watch on their activities. They could perhaps get the help of an older relative to take care of their children in their absence. Working parents must ensure that they spend at least some time with their children. Schools and colleges must create awareness among the youth about the evil effects of drug addiction. The media can also play a significant role.

1184,"Some people believe that cooking food at home is a complete waste of time. According to them, restaurants are better and make modern living easier and a whole lot less stressful. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","
Restaurants serve ready to eat meals for a price. They are a boon for busy professionals who do not have enough time to cook a proper meal. It is true that restaurant food makes modern living easier, still it cannot be considered better than home-made food because of health concerns.
People who eat at restaurants on a regular basis develop many health problems. Restaurants might claim that they take all measures to ensure that food is cooked and served in a hygienic environment. However, this is not always true. Routines inspections by food inspectors often reveal an ugly picture. In the recent past, food authorities shut down many restaurants in Kerala, India because they did not score well in the cleanliness department.
Another questionable and equally harmful practice is the use of preservatives and other chemicals. In a bid to enhance the texture and flavour of food items restaurants often use chemicals that are harmful for health. Preservatives are used in large quantities to prolong the shelf life of food items. When consumed on a regular basis, these chemicals will ruin a person’s health.
Home-made food, on the other hand, is healthier. Of course, cooking food at home is not always easy and may consume a lot of time. Still, it is better. Home-made food is unlikely to contain preservatives and harmful chemicals. What’s more food cooked at home is cheaper. A restaurant meal usually costs much more than a typical meal cooked at home. People who do not have the time to cook their own food can employ a cook. And the money they save on their restaurant bills can be used to pay their cook.
In conclusion, cooking food at home is not a waste of time. In fact it is absolutely essential for good health. Restaurants are good for eating out once in a while but they can’t replace traditional home cooking.",7.5,ielts-writing-test-in-hong-kong-and-singapore-cooking-food-at-home-is-a-waste-of-time
1185,The quality of life in large cities is decreasing. What could be the reasons behind this? What measures can be taken to resolve this problem.,"Environmental pollution and unhygienic surroundings are a common problem in many cities. When a city houses more people than it can possibly afford, it is hard to maintain cleanliness. Unhygienic surroundings are the breeding ground for germs and cause many health problems. Vehicular pollution affects the quality of air and leads to many respiratory ailments. All of these affect the quality of life in cities.
The cost of living is also pretty high in metros. In large cities, it is hard to find decent accommodation within one’s budget. Consequently, people are forced to buy ridiculously small homes for huge prices. Those who cannot afford to do so spend the whole of their lives in rented apartments. Worse still, the law and order situation in many big cities is not particularly good making them unsafe for visitors as well as those dwelling in those localities.
However, many of these problems can be solved with a little bit of planning. High population density is the main reason that reduces the quality of life in cities. Although this is not exactly avoidable, governments can reduce the migration to cities by making jobs available in smaller towns as well. For example, environmental units can be set up in small towns and villages. If these units employ the people living nearby they will not have to move into large cities. What’s more, the fact that cities are home to a large number of people makes it possible for civic bodies to collect more money from taxes etc. If these taxes are utilized properly civic authorities can build better roads and flyovers that will ease the traffic congestion. And by improving the quality of public health care, the government can ensure that all people get medical attention when they need it.
In conclusion, poor planning and the centralization of jobs is the main reason that reduces the quality of life in large cities. However, these problems are solvable to a great extent. The governments just need to make a determined effort to decentralize the jobs.",7.5,ielts-essay-the-quality-of-life-in-cities-in-worsening
1186,Essay topic,"Today, most of people are getting fat by in correct food habits. I will explain the causes of increasing people’s weight and some solutions.
The main cause why people’s weight are more increased and its solution for losing weight can be explained.  The improving technology can affect people because people spend too much time for watching TV and playing games. For instance, people keep eating snacks or drinking when they watching TV, TThe more they tend to eat while watching television, the more they gain body mass. Thus, watching television has an impact on their over body weight. If they do not watch television much, they would eat only 3 meals per day as usual, where as while watching television two or three bags of popcorn or crackers which contains high fat.  The solution to solve this problem is change the hobby like a soccer, swimming. While the physically active, they lose the over fat. Besides, While they involve in games, they eat less. A regular exercise plan can reduce overweight significantly.  Therefore, exercise can reduce this weight if they do it regularly.
Secondly, food change is the another cause because people do not have much time to eat and they prefer more simple food such as a processed food. For example, some workers want to take a rest after lunch, whereas, the lunch time is short they want to eat lunch quickly, as a result  they find fast food shops and eat the junk food such as fries which contains refined oil. On the other hands, if people were eating home-made food, less chance to consume fat or refined oil. Thus, the shift of food preference and work life have negatively impacted as overweight. Having been discussed it, to solve this problem, announcing slow food’s importance and teaching food awareness is good idea. People will change their preference when they realize this issue. For example, health awareness against cigarette smoking has substantially reduced the intake of cigarette consumption per day, in turn , people tend to smoke less.Therefore, the same strategy ( advertisements or announcements) can be applied to reduce the overweight issues.
To sum up, after explaining the causes and solutions, it is clear that over weight problem is possible to solve by taking effective measures.

1187,Some people think that a sense of competition should be encouraged in children. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more successful adults. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"A competition between children especially in academic curriculum makes them to work harder in order to achieve their goals. They will study hard to keep up with their peers. As a result, they will achieve a good result in academic subjects and successfully enter the prestigious university for their further studies. Once they have graduated from universities, they can apply for a better job with their qualification gained. As a result, they can earn a lucrative salary if they have a better job. Therefore, a sense of competition in children is a key factor to help them to success in their future.
Therefore, a sense of competition in children is a key factor that could propel them to success in their future.
On the other hand, cooperation is necessary in the lives of children because it moulds them into a useful adult. They are able to learn from their friends when they are working together as a team. When co-operating, they will recognize the weakness and strength of themselves along with their friends. As a result, they will gradually improve the skills such as how to communicate with other people effectively and how to manage the time when they grow up. Thus, teaching children to be a part of a team is beneficial for their future.
As a result, they will gradually improve the skills. For example, they will learn how to communicate effectively with other people and how to manage their time when they grow up.
It is very important to teach children in order to become team players; however, it is also crucial for them to be able to compete and win in their life. In my opinion, children should be taught to co-operate with other children in order to become a useful person. When they grow up, they need to work with other people more often than compete with them unless they are a professional sportsman.

1189,More and more people now own cars. What are the problems associated with an increase in the usage of private cars? How can these problems be solved?,"When more and more cars hit the roads, there is an increase in vehicular pollution. The quality of air in cities is already bad. An increase in the number of cars will make the situation even worse. Atmospheric pollution can lead to global warming. When average temperatures rise, they cause drastic changes in weather patterns across the world. What’s more when the quality of air decreases, there is an increase in the incidences of respiratory diseases.
Although technology has significantly advanced in the last few decades, cars and other vehicles are still run on fossil fuels like petrol and diesel. These are not renewable sources of energy and are getting used up fast. In many countries fuel prices are already pretty high. A further depletion in the reserves of fossil fuels will make petrol and diesel costlier. In such a scenario, even public transport systems will be unaffordable. This will badly affect the poor.
An increase in the number of private cars also leads to more accidents. Countless lives are lost in accidents every day. This is clearly an indication that our existing infrastructure is incapable of handling more vehicles.
Since cars are a status symbol, it is not easy to dissuade people from buying them. However, governments can encourage more people to depend on the public transport system by upgrading their quality and reliability. If trains and buses arrive on time, more people will depend on them. Carpooling is another option. People who work in the same office can share car journeys. By doing this they can not only reduce their fuel expenses, but also make the roads a little less busy and hence safer.
In conclusion, a rise in the number of private cars leads to several problems. However, the governments can improve the situation by making public transport systems more reliable.

1190,People use animals for profit in many ways. Some people believe that this use of animals must be discouraged. Discuss both views and express your own opinion.,"Some people believe that using animals with the sole objective of making profits is not fair. Personally I agree with this view. However, there are certain situations where this use of animals must be allowed.
For many people, animal products like milk, meat and eggs are an integral part of their diet. Since human beings can subsist on a purely vegetarian diet, this killing of animals for food is a questionable practice. If meat and poultry are banned from the dining tables, numerous animals will be saved. On the flip side, vegetarianism is essentially a way of life. It is not something that can be forced.
Although some people are also against using animals in drug tests, this is not something that can be avoided. Medical trials conducted in rats and pigs have helped save millions of lives. Of course, numerous animals have lost their lives in the process. Still a human life is more precious than an animal life and that justifies the use of animals in medical trials.
Raising and killing animals and birds for their fur, silk, skin and feathers must be banned. Animals like crocodiles and tigers now face the threat of extinction because they are killed for their skin. Peacocks are also becoming an endangered species. Governments all over the world must enact stringent laws to prevent the exploitation of animals in this manner.
In conclusion, using animals for our profit should be encouraged only in exceptional cases. Animals also have a rightful place on this planet and it is our duty to protect them.",7.5,ielts-essay-some-people-believe-that-animals-should-not-be-used-for-profit-do-you-agree-or-disagree
1191,Some people believe that men and women possess different skills. According to them certain jobs are more suitable for men than women. There are also some jobs where women perform better. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Until a few decades ago many people used to believe that women are not suitable for a career in science or finance. Such wrong notions no longer exist because many women have proved that they make equally brilliant engineers and number crunchers. Still, certain sectors prefer men over women. There are also some sectors where women outperform men.
Thanks to their stronger physique, men are more suitable for physically demanding jobs than women. For example, jobs in mining and mechanics are laborious and involve handling heavy machinery. A few women have proved that they are capable of handling such jobs, but the majority of workers employed in these sectors are men. The armed forces also recruit more men than women.
Though women lack physical prowess, they score better than men in some other areas. For example, women are more caring and patient. These qualities make them excellent teachers and nurses. Women also possess better people skills and are considered more suitable for careers in hospitality and public relations.
Of course, several women have proved that they are capable of doing just about anything that men can. Take for instance, the case of Madam Curie, the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for Physics. She proved her mettle at a time when science and technology were largely dominated by men. Women have also conquered the seas, the mountains and the skies. The fact that they lacked muscle power didn’t deter them from pursuing their goals. Still, these are exceptions rather than the rules.
In conclusion, certain jobs are more suitable for men. There are also certain jobs where women perform better than men. Personally I believe that a person’s physical and intellectual capabilities, rather than gender, should determine his or her career choice. If a woman possesses sufficient physical strength and is determined enough to pursue a career in a male dominated sector, her gender should not come in the way of her goal. The same theory applies to men as well.",7.5,ielts-essay-certain-jobs-are-more-suitable-for-men-than-women
1192,The clothing and fashion industry have a big influence on people. Is this a good or bad thing?,"Fashion helps people dress well. Fashionable clothes make us more presentable. When people dress fashionably they feel good about themselves. This boosts their level of confidence and makes them perform well in the workplace. It is now a known fact that people who dress and look well have better chances of getting a job. Even if a person is not blessed with naturally good looks, they can make themselves more presentable by dressing well. That is where fashion helps.
On the flip side, fashion can blind people. Fashion trends are often launched by films and rich people. What celebrities wear on and off screen soon become a craze with the general public. In a bid to become the most fashionable among their peers, youngsters often spend insane amounts of money on clothes and other accessories. This could make their poorer friends and colleagues feel inferior. What’s more, fashionable clothes are not always the best. Fashion trends that originate in the US or Europe may not suit the climate or the culture of Asian countries.  This often leads to a conflict of interest.
In conclusion, clothing and fashion industry have a big influence on people. However, this trend has both advantages and disadvantages.

1193,People should plan for their retirement by saving money. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"People who work in the service sector have to retire someday. And when they retire, their earning capacity declines or simply disappears. Unless you are in a career with guaranteed retirement benefits, you need to start planning for those twilight years while you are still working and earning.
Many people dread their retirement years and that is hardly surprising. When people retire they lose their steady stream of income. This could make them feel worthless. Retirement years are also plagued by health problems and other worries. People who haven’t planned for this stage by saving enough money will find it difficult to tide over this crisis.
In many countries, for example, in India parents expect their children to take care of them when they grow old. Although many young people will willingly provide for their aged parents, some are not all that generous. Needless to say, many aged people are now forced to spend their last years in old age homes because their children are either unwilling or incapable of taking care of them. If these people had secured their retirement years by saving money, they would have been able to lead a dignified life until their last breath.
What’s more, people’s perception of retirement has undergone a tremendous change in recent years. Gone are the days when retirement was all about babysitting one’s grandchildren.  Now many aged people have their own dreams and aspirations. For example, they might want to learn a new skill or do a bit of traveling. None of these would be possible if they didn’t have money in their hand.
Of course, people working in the public sector will receive pension and other benefits when they retire. They may not need to plan for their retirement by saving money. Still, planning makes life easier. It makes us better equipped to handle the many surprises that life throws at us.
In conclusion, planning for one’s retirement by saving money is absolutely necessary. It makes life more enjoyable and free of worries.Even if a person is working in the public sector with guaranteed retirement benefits, it makes sense to build a retirement corpus by setting aside a small sum every month.",7.5,ielts-writing-test-in-india-should-people-plan-for-their-retirement

This has encouraged more and more people to spend their vacations in exotic foreign destinations. The growth in international trade opportunities is also prompting more and more people to travel.
As competition heats up among airlines, air tickets become more and more affordable. And when air tickets become more affordable, more and more people are going to travel. Another equally important reason is the rise in the number of households with disposable incomes. Many families now earn a lot more than they need. People with high income are exploring newer ways to spend that money. It is quite common for them to travel to foreign countries. Families with surplus income are also more likely to send their children abroad for higher studies.
In addition to this, the world as a whole is becoming one big global village. Growing trade opportunities in the developing world have encouraged multinational corporations to open offices in them. People who work for MNCs have to engage in international travel very frequently. This was a relatively unknown phenomenon until the world economy opened up one or two decades ago.
After analyzing the situation, it is easy to see that tourism and trade are the main factors that contribute towards the increase in international travel. If the world economy continues to grow at this pace, this trend is going to continue.",7.5,ielts-essay-more-people-are-traveling-than-before-why-is-this
1195,Should children attend nursery schools prior to their primary studies?  Is this a positive or negative development?,"In many countries it is now mandatory for children to attend some sort of preschool before they can get into a primary school. Although some people believe that it is an ideal arrangement, it does have a few negative aspects as well. Let me elaborate.
There is no denying the fact that nursery schools teach children many skills necessary for doing well in primary and upper primary schools. It is a known fact that children who go to a nursery school have better social skills than those who spend the whole day at home with their parents. They are less shy and more comfortable interacting with other children and even elders. They learn to share and cooperate.
On the other hand, many nursery schools now put unnecessary emphasis on academics. Children as young as two and three years are taught alphabets and numbers. This puts them under tremendous pressure and robs them of their childhood. What’s more, children attending nursery schools have to be away from their parents for at least six to eight hours. This can make them feel insecure.
In conclusion, sending very young children to nursery schools is both advantageous and disadvantageous in many ways. By going to a pre-primary school, children can learn important social skills.  But pre-schooling can also expose them to academic pressure from a very early age. At least a few of them begin to detest school when they grow up. However, these problems can be solved by making sufficient changes to nursery school curriculum and placing greater emphasis on songs and play.",7.5,ielts-essay-should-children-attend-nursery-schools-prior-to-their-primary-studies
1196,"Some people think that recent innovations in technology have made life more comfortable and helped us to be more efficient by saving us time, while others argue that technology has made us less efficient.","Technology has been around for quite some time, but the pace at which it developed in recent years has both startled and surprised people. Nowadays, new and improved gadgets hit the market almost every day. In a couple of weeks they become outdated and are replaced by even more sophisticated ones.
It is true that technological innovations have made our lives more comfortable. It is now hard to imagine a life without such appliances as refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and washing machines. The advent of computers changed the way we process and access information. Mobile phones help people to stay connected all the time. And with internet, we can access a limitless pool of information from the comforts of our home. Indeed, technology has not only made our lives more comfortable, but also become an integral part of it.
On the other hand, technology can cause a great deal of stress to people who are overly dependent on it. Now that internet and cell phones allow people to stay connected all the time, there is no escaping from one’s work. People carry their phones around and can’t help checking their emails even when they are on a vacation. Worse still, too much reliance on technology can make us less efficient. Now many people don’t even bother to remember their own telephone number. They expect their computers and cellphones to remember everything for them. This makes their brain idle.
What’s more, when technology gets more and more sophisticated day by day it is not easy to keep pace with it. Many modern cellphones, computers and cameras boast of complicated features that ordinary users cannot understand. People often have to spend a great deal of time learning how to use the most recent gadgets. By the time, they had figured out how to use a particular device, a more sophisticated one would have hit the market.
In conclusion, technological innovations make lives more comfortable. However, I don’t think that they make us more efficient because most of us who handle these devices do not have the technical expertise to do it. Unless we learn to use these devices properly, they are unlikely to make us more efficient.",7.5,ielts-essay-has-technology-made-us-more-efficient
1197,Technological innovations have affected our lives. Do you agree or disagree?,"There is no denying the fact that technological innovations have affected our lives in many ways. While some innovations have made our lives better, others have provoked many people to debate whether technology is essentially good.
Technology has made lives easier and more comfortable. Thanks to advanced transport facilities we can now travel to any part of the world. This was not possible some hundred years ago. Inventions like telephone and computers have significantly improved our lives. Thanks to internet and mobile phones we can now communicate with people from all over the world.
Of course, every coin has two sides. It is wrong to even assume that every scientific breakthrough and technological invention is good for us. Some of them have affected our lives negatively. Take, for instance, the case of environmental pollution. Pollution is very much a by-product of technology. It has led to the extinction of many species. It causes many diseases in human beings. A large number of us now lead a sedentary life style because there is a gadget for just about every job and situation.  Pollution and lack of physical activity have now become quite a health issue in many developed countries. While social networking sites allow you to connect with people from all over the world, they do not necessarily build relationships. In fact, studies have proved that people now spend less time interacting with friends and family on a one-on-one basis. Worse still, the misuse of internet and camera phones have become an alarming issue in modern society.
After analyzing the situation, it is not hard to see that technology does have some negative effects. However, it doesn’t mean that all technological innovations are bad for society. In fact, many inventions have done a great deal of good to mankind. Technology is essentially a multi-purpose tool. It is our duty to use it for the betterment of our lives. If we misuse it, the problem is with us.",7.5,ielts-essay-technological-innovations-have-affected-our-lives-do-you-agree-or-disagree
1198,Sport is becoming a business. More and more companies are getting involved in sporting events. Do you think that it is a positive or negative development?,"Major sporting events attract millions of viewers. Needless to say, they have become quite popular with corporates trying to reach more and more customers. By sponsoring popular sporting events companies significantly improve their brand recall value. Nowadays, big corporate houses are not only sponsoring sports events; they are also buying sports teams. It is a win-win situation for both. Sport gets the financial assistance it desperately needs. Companies build their brands. However, this development, too, has some negative aspects. Let’s analyze.
Now that companies pump in millions of dollars into many sports items, talented players are eager to enter the field. This is a definitely a positive development. Sportsmen, at least those who play popular items, are now assured of a steady income. In the olden days, many sports persons weren’t earning enough to make a living. Prize money wasn’t good. Sponsorship deals hardly ever existed. This deterred many talented players from pursuing a career in sports. Now the situation is totally different. Corporate sponsorship has also helped many sporting events from becoming extinct.
On the flip side, when sports become a business, the focus can shift from talent to profit. Although big prize monies and sponsorship deals can attract fresh talent into the game, sometimes the same can lead to problems like match fixing. It is not uncommon for international cricket and football players to get involved in match fixing controversies. The pressure to perform can also compel many players to consume performance enhancing drugs. What’s more, the events that attract corporate involvement are already popular on their own.  For example, in India cricket is hugely popular so companies are eager to sponsor cricketers. Players of other less popular events don’t have any sponsors.
After analyzing both sides of the argument, it is not hard to see that corporates entering the field of sports is both good and bad. Big prize money and sponsorship deals will definitely encourage more people to pursue a career in sports. On the other hand, companies will always have business interest in their mind. Sometimes this can take the focus off the game.",7.5,ielts-essay-sport-is-becoming-a-business-is-this-a-positive-development
1199,The following essay topic was asked in IELTS writing tests held in Australia in March 2013.,"Sample essay
There are many reasons why our kids are not as healthy and as fit as we were in our childhood. Children today lead a sedentary lifestyle. They spend a great deal of time watching TV and playing video games. They also have to deal with tremendous academic pressure. Many of them attend private coaching classes after regular school hours. The truth is that most children do not get an opportunity or time to engage in physical activities.
Being physically active is absolutely essential for being fit. Now most households have computers and internet connection. Children as young as three or four spend hours playing games on their parents’ computers and smartphones. At an age when they should be running all over the place, they become couch potatoes. This stunts their physical growth.
Another reason for the health problems among young children is the excessive consumption of junk food. In many families both parents work. They don’t get enough time to cook proper meals for their children. To compensate for that, they stuff their fridge with junk items. Excessive consumption of junk food leads to obesity which in turn will further reduce their inclination to play. What’s more junk food is not nutritive. It merely provides energy. If children do not eat nutritious food, they will not grow into healthy adults.
Providing ample opportunities for engaging in outdoor activities is absolutely essential to solve this problem. Parents should make sure that children do not spend more than one or two hours a day in front of the TV or computer. Schools, too, have an important role to play. They must make physical activity an important part of the curriculum. Marks should be awarded to students who perform well in sports and games.",7.5,ielts-essay-kids-today-are-not-as-fit-as-they-were-in-the-past
1200,"Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoid change. Others, on the other hand, are always trying new things. They believe that change is a good thing. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Some people are always making changes to their lives. Others, on the other hand, are content with their lot and resist the need to change. Personally, I believe that change is a good thing because it makes our lives more interesting and offers opportunities for growth.
The reason that prompts many people to make changes to their lives is the need to fight boredom. If we do the same thing day in and day out we will soon find it boring. By making some changes every now and then we can add that much needed variety to our lives and spice things up. A change can be an opportunity to learn. It throws fresh challenges that test a person’s ability to adapt and grow. It can also make our lives more interesting. When people try new things, they knowledge and skills improve. Trying new things will also help them overcome their inhibitions and hidden fears. Better still, in many cases a change can bring out the latent talents in a person.
On the other hand, when people spend their lives doing the same thing, they limit their chances of growth. People who resist the need to change have limited scope for career growth because of their inability to acquire new skills. Not so long ago, when computerization began many people lost their jobs because they couldn’t learn to use the computer. If these people had been willing to accept the challenge and learn a new skill, they would not have lost their jobs.
After analyzing both sides of the argument, it is easy to see that change is a good thing. It provides an excellent opportunity to learn and grow. It also makes our lives more interesting.",7.5,ielts-essay-is-change-a-good-thing
1201,"After leaving school or university, young people should choose a job or career that they love, rather than one that pays the best salary. To what extent do you agree with this statement?","For some people, money is the biggest factor that determines their choice of career. They will pursue high-paying jobs even if they don’t enjoy it. Others, on the other hand, follow their heart and choose a career they love. Personally I believe that job satisfaction is far more important than salary.
Jobs are an important aspect of life. An average human being spends a great deal of his or her time in the workplace. If you love your job, you don’t need another reason to get up early in the morning and leave for work. People who enjoy their job look forward to going to their workplace every morning. Moreover, if you enjoy your work, you are more likely to prosper in your career. You may not earn a huge pay packet in the beginning, but your passion for your profession will ultimately take you places. On the other hand, if you are in a career that you detest, you are unlikely to have the motivation to go to work. This lack of enthusiasm will ultimately limit your chances of professional growth. Worse still, if you don’t like your job, it could stress you out and lead to many health problems.
This doesn’t necessarily mean that money is not important. Of course, it is. You are unlikely to be happy if you do not earn enough to make a living. However, there is no justification for doing something that you don’t enjoy just for the sake of making more money.
In conclusion, it is clear that choosing a career that one loves has many advantages over choosing one just for the sake of money. If you love what you do, your chances of success are pretty high and money will follow.",7.5,ielts-essay-people-should-choose-a-job-they-do-you-agree
1202,Celebrities such as actors and sports personalities earn a lot more than other professionals. Some people believe that this is unfair while others think that celebrities deserve to be paid more. Discuss both points of view and give your own opinion on the subject.,"Famous sporting and film personalities earn a lot more money than people in other professions. Some people believe that it is unfair. Others, on the other hand, find nothing wrong with celebrities earning more. In this essay I will discuss both sides of the argument before arriving at a conclusion.
Famous personalities such as actors, singers and athletes earn insane amounts of money. In fact, celebrities are among the highest paid professionals all over world. While it might seem unfair to some people, one cannot overlook the fact that celebrities also help generate jobs and income. Major sporting events generate millions of dollars in advertising revenue. They create jobs for people involved in catering and logistics. Cities that host these events attract tourists from all over the world. In short, an international event such as Olympics or World Cup Football has the power to boost a nation’s economy.  The film sector, too, provides employment to tens of thousands of people. It is also not uncommon for celebrities to make generous donations to charities.
On the other hand, most celebrities lack academic or professional qualifications. They are just cashing in on their inborn talents. Still they earn a lot of more than other professionals who studied hard for acquiring the necessary qualifications. People who are against paying huge salaries to celebrities might argue that many of them lack genuine skills and are essentially a product of our celebrity-obsessed media and culture. They believe that actors or players don’t have a great role to play in the success of a film or sporting event.
After analyzing both sides of the argument it is hard to say whether the huge salaries of celebrities are justified. Both critics and advocates seem to have plenty of arguments in support of their views. I personally believe that the salaries earned by all professionals including celebrities should be proportionate to the income they generate.",7.5,celebrities-earn-more-money-than-other-professionals-is-this-justified
1203,Disruptive school students have a negative influence on others. Students who are noisy and disobedient should be grouped together and taught separately. Do you agree or disagree. Give your reasons.,"There is no denying the fact that noisy and disobedient students disrupt classes and leave a negative impact on others. This, however, doesn’t necessarily mean that they should be grouped together and taught separately because such grouping will only solve part of the problem. Of course, it will benefit the well-behaving students. But the students thus segregated are unlikely to gain anything from this arrangement.
Disobedient students try the patience of their teachers. They make it impossible to cover portions in the required time frame. Worse still, they cause major distractions. They might even encourage other students to behave like them. And hence there is some truth in the argument that disruptive students have a negative impact on others. By putting them in another class, teachers can improve the academic performance of other students.
On the other hand, the children who are thus grouped and taught separately are unlikely to gain anything. It will not improve their academic performance. It is also unlikely to improve their manners. In all likelihood they will grow into adults with criminal tendencies. Some of them could also develop an inferiority complex.
As stated above, grouping students according to their manners is perhaps not a brilliant idea. If only well-mannered and academically bright students are put together in a class, it will definitely improve their performance. But that is not quite a solution because schools and teachers have a duty to ensure the intellectual and psychological development of all students, not just the intelligent ones.
What’s more studies have always proved that behavioural problems could have some underlying causes. It is possible that these children have an abusive background. Their disobedience is probably a sign of the problems they face at home. Perhaps a better solution is to provide counseling. It might improve their manners without making them feel unwanted or inferior.",7.5,essay-should-disobedient-students-be-taught-separately
1204,Nowadays many couples are not interested in having children early in their lives. What are the causes behind this phenomenon? And what are the effects on family and society?,"The reason that prompts many couples to delay parenthood is the desire to secure their financial independence before they become parents. They want to establish themselves in their chosen career before the baby arrives. Nowadays in most families both husband and wife work. And when both of them work, they do not have the time to raise a baby. As a result of this they postpone the baby until they have achieved the desired level of financial security.
The problem with this arrangement is that it can lead to many health problems. It can even lead to infertility. As people age their fertility decreases. For example, a large number of women in their 30’s and 40’s have difficulty conceiving. And couples who fail to conceive after delaying pregnancy in the first few years of their marriage are more likely to experience feelings of guilt and anger. They end up spending insane amounts of money on infertility treatment.  This will drive up the cost of medical insurance. If they still fail to conceive, it is not uncommon for a large number of them to fall into depression. They might also find it difficult to deal with the questions of their family and friends.
Even if they manage to conceive, their pregnancy is more likely to be inflicted with numerous health problems. For example, when a woman becomes pregnant after she turns 35, she is more likely to develop problems like gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. These women are also more likely to undergo a Caesarian section and give birth to underweight babies. The babies, too, are affected. Children conceived at an advanced age are more likely to suffer from congenital anomalies like autism.
As stated above delaying pregnancy is not a positive trend. It can affect the health of both mom and baby. And unhealthy women and children are not in the interest of the society. It is hoped that instead of postponing pregnancy, couples would make alternate arrangements to fit a baby into their busy schedule.",7.5,ielts-sample-essay-why-do-couples-delay-parenthood
1205,The crime rate among teenagers has increased dramatically in many countries.  Discuss some possible reasons for this increase and suggest solutions. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.,"The number of teens who gets involved in criminal activities is on the rise. This is quite distressing because teenage is a wonderful period of life when children should be busy working towards building a flourishing career and a secure future. There are many reasons for this increase in crime rate among teenagers. The most important among them will be discussed in this essay.
Although this is not a country-specific phenomenon this rise in crime-rate is mainly observed in countries where a healthy family institution doesn’t exist. Children coming from a functional family unit are less likely to get into crime or other anti-social activities. That is because they are answerable to someone at home. This fear of authority will naturally deter from indulging in this sort of activities. What’s more, children experience more emotional security in a loving family which makes them less prone to developing criminal tendencies.
On the other hand, children of divorced parents have to deal with a lot of stress. In many countries, especially in the West, the institution of family is not all that strong. In fact, a large number of children are brought up by single moms and in a few cases, single dads. The chronic absence of one parent can have a huge impact on the emotional well-being of the children. A lot of them turn to crime to give vent to their pent-up emotions and frustration. Another reason behind this rise in the crime rate is the glorification of violence in films and electronic media. Even family oriented films and television serials now depict an overdose of crime. All of these can influence the impressionable mind of a teenager. They might even arrive at the conclusion that it is fashionable to be a criminal.
To conclude, we cannot deal with this issue if changes do not happen at the fundamental level.  For example, parents have a duty to ensure that their children are brought up in a healthy family atmosphere.  They must also closely monitor the activities of their children. They should know who they are hanging out with and how they are doing in school. Single parents can seek the help of grandparents and other adult relatives in bringing up the children. Schools, too, have an important role to play. They can invent interesting activities to keep students engaged even after school hours. If a teen is busy with his studies and extra-curricular activities he is unlikely to have the time to nurture criminal tendencies.",7.5,ielts-essay-rise-in-crime-rate-among-teenagers
1206,"Some people argue that governments should stop supporting the professional sporting events and cultural programs, and instead support schools from where students can take up sports and arts. What is your opinion?","In most countries professional sporting events and cultural programs enjoy the patronage of governments and that is hardly surprising. Major shows like the Olympics or the Soccer World Cup cannot be held without the support of the government because of the huge amounts of money required for building the necessary infrastructure and other facilities for these events. Some people argue that the government should not play a role in organizing these events. However, it is hard to support this argument.
It is true that the governments spend enormous amounts of money on these events. Interestingly, this spending is justified because these events not only entertain people they also generate huge income. What’s more, these events are an opportunity to showcase a country and its talents before the world. If a country manages to properly organize a global sporting event or cultural program it can significantly improve its image before the world.
Take for instance, the London Olympics 2012. By organizing the event in an immaculate manner, Great Britain significantly improved its image. For the British, it was an opportunity to showcase London and what they were capable of doing. And they didn’t miss it. A poorly organized event, on the other hand, can tarnish the country’s image. What’s more, sports and arts are excellent platforms to bring people together. They facilitate global harmony.
Of course, there is some truth in the argument that governments should support schools so that children can polish their sports and arts skills from an early age. In fact, most governments in the world already do this. However, the argument that governments should withdraw their support for professional sporting and cultural events and instead support only schools is hard to justify.",7.5,ielts-sample-essay-should-governments-support-professional-sporting-events
1207,Most writers of fiction do not earn enough money to live from their writing. Do you think the government should give them financial assistance to help encourage good literature?,"The fact that many writers find it difficult to make a decent living from their writing is well-known. Of course, we do have some celebrity writers who consistently figure in the Forbes’ list of richest people. But for writers who haven’t already established themselves in this field, the reality is quite different. Some people argue that if the governments provide financial assistance to these newbie writers, they will be able to produce good literature. And this argument is true to some extent.
It is true that good writing skills are something that we have to be born with. Of course, writers can polish their skills with some practice, but if they don’t have that natural flair for writing no amount of financial help or motivation will make earn them eminence in the literary scene.
On the other hand, there are some writers who have the skills but lack the means to pursue a full-time career in writing. Writing is a demanding job and when you start out you are unlikely to have a huge fan-following dying to read every word you write. That means there is no guarantee that you will make a living from writing. This can deter many good writers from following their dream. If the government provides them with financial assistance, they will probably be able to produce good literature.
However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the governments should financially support all the writers. That option is not viable at all. But those talented but financially constrained writers will definitely benefit from this.
As explained above, a little bit of financial assistance will definitely encourage more people to become good writers. And if the truly talented receive financial help, they will definitely be able to produce good quality literature.",7.5,ielts-sample-essay-should-governments-provide-financial-assistance-to-writers
1208,Many people these days travel far for work or spend more hours working. Does this trend have more advantages or disadvantages? What do you think about work-life balance?,"For one thing, there is absolutely nothing to prove that long working hours improve productivity. In fact, when people work longer than they should, what happens is that their productivity decreases. They fail to concentrate and take longer to finish jobs. Traveling far for work doesn’t help either. In many major cities people often have to travel several hours to reach their work place. When at last, they reach home braving the traffic and a hard-working day, they have little energy left in them. In addition, studies have proved that people who spend long hours in the office are also more likely to develop major health problems like heart disease and dementia.
We have already seen that long working hours doesn’t necessarily translate into improved productivity. Another problem with this set up is the effect it has on a person’s family and social life. When people spend long hours in the office, they get little time to spend with their dear ones. Parents, who work long hours, often fail to take proper care of their young children. This can be quite a problem in families where both parents work. When children are deprived of the attention they deserve, it will affect their emotional well-being. It can also have a negative impact on their academic performance. In extreme cases, failure to strike a balance between work and life can lead to the breakup of families.
As explained above, long working hours are in nobody’s interest. They don’t improve an individual’s productivity. In fact, they make them less productive. What’s more, when people spend more time in the office, their family life suffers. In other words proper work-life balance is absolutely essential to lead a contented life. It is hoped that companies arrange their working hours in such a way that employees also get some time for themselves.",7.5,ielts-essay-is-work-life-balance-necessary
1209,"Some people think that politicians have the greatest influence on the world. Others, however, believe that scientists have the greatest influence. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the democratic set-up politicians are the biggest policy-makers. They make laws and policies that affect the lives of millions or even billions of people. And hence there is no denying the fact that politicians are influential people. Scientists are influential, too. The developments in science and technology have significantly changed our lives. But does that mean that scientists are more influential than politicians or vice-versa? Let’s examine.
Politicians have always played a significant role in shaping the destinies of many countries. They are the rulers and the law-makers in democratic countries. Sometimes the decisions that they take not only affect the internal affairs of a country, but also have an impact on the global scene. For example, there would have been no World Wars if all politicians had been in favour of peace. There would no terrorism if all politicians believed in tolerance and peaceful co-existence. In other words, politicians have the power to change the world.
Scientists are equally influential. Developments in science have made our lives more comfortable. Life-saving drugs have blessed us with longevity. In fact, all the comforts that we enjoy today are the products of science and technology.  On the flip side, scientific innovations have also led to the creation of weapons of mass destruction. One can never underestimate the contributions that scientists have made to the society. In fact, if there were no scientists we would still be living in caves hunting animals. It was scientists who led us from the caves to the skyscrapers.
As discussed above, both politicians and scientists have influenced the world. It is not possible to say that one group is more influential than the other. In fact, they both have the power to change the world for the better or the worse.",7.5,ielts-essay-writing-task-are-politicians-more-influential-than-scientists
1210,Some people believe that strict policies are necessary to regulate internet because a lot of harmful content is available online with very little or no regulation. Others oppose this view and think that the internet should not be regulated.,"The internet has changed the way we access information. It is a web of infinite knowledge accessible to everybody with a personal computer and an internet connection. The best thing about internet is that it makes searching information easy and automated. You just need to key in your query and software robots called search engines will find answers for you – all in a matter of seconds. Some people believe that the internet needs to be regulated because it freely provides both good and bad content. Others, however, disagree with this view and believe that the internet should not be regulated.
It is true that the internet provides harmful content with little or no regulation. Tens of thousands of websites containing obscene, racist and hateful content are available online. The problem with the internet is that it is merely a vast pool of data and it doesn’t understand the distinction between good and bad. If you have got an internet connection, you can access all websites on the internet. This free availability of inappropriate and hateful content is definitely a threat. For example, children surfing the web may accidentally find adult content. What’s more, in recent years internet fraud has increased. Therefore it might seem reasonable that strict policies are necessary to regulate the internet.
On the flip side, regulating the internet may affect its usability to a great extent. Right now the internet allows anybody to publish and share content online. In fact, one of the factors that led to this enormous growth of internet is the ease with which users can contribute and share information. Stricter regulation will definitely make this difficult or even impossible. If people are required to obtain permission to post online, it will seriously impair the functionality of internet.
As for the dangers of inappropriate content, well, several software suites are already available to make internet safe for kids. For example, parents can block adult websites with special software thereby making the net safe for their kids. Effective anti-virus software tools available to make online surfing and shopping sessions safer. And hence it seems educating people about safe and unsafe online habits is far more effective than introducing strict regulations. This will still make the internet a free territory while at the same time protecting users from harmful content.",7.5,ielts-sample-essay-should-internet-be-regulated
1211,Studies suggest that the rise in the consumption of junk foods is the major cause of obesity. Some people argue that this problem can be tackled to a great extent by increasing the price of these food items. Do you agree or disagree?,"Obesity or excessive fattiness has become a major health crisis all over the world. The worst thing about obesity is that it leads to major diseases such as heart trouble, diabetes and in some cases even cancer. One of the major causes of obesity is the rise in the consumption of junk or fast foods. These food items contain high levels of unhealthy fats which make people gain weight. Some people argue that this problem can be solved to a great extent by increasing the price of junk foods. Interestingly, this argument is true to a great extent.
Consumers are a price-sensitive lot. Market studies have always proved that there is less demand for pricey items. This is one of the reasons why companies often launch new products at reduced or even half the prices. When the prices are low even those people who don’t really need the product are likely to buy it. The demand will automatically go down when the prices go up. This is especially true in the case of food items.
One of the reasons behind the popularity of junk foods is their affordability. If their prices go up, few people will be able to buy them. This will automatically reduce their consumption. What’s more, when fast foods become unaffordable people will automatically turn towards home-cooked healthier items. This will not only improve their overall wellness, but also reduce their weight.

1212,Writing task 2 (an essay),"Festivals bring cheer and provide an opportunity to celebrate. They help us forget the bitter realities of our existence and hope for a better tomorrow. Needless to say, people all over the world celebrate special occasions like national holidays and festivals. It is true that insane amounts of money are spent on these public celebrations but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they are a waste of money or other resources.
Festivals and national holidays are perhaps the most eagerly anticipated occasions of the year.  The best thing about public celebrations is that they bring people together. For example, Diwali is celebrated in all parts of India. This festival not only brings people together but also helps them stay connected with their culture and values. Nowadays it isn’t uncommon for different members of a family to live in different parts of the world. They hardly get an opportunity to meet one another. In most cases festivals are the only occasions they get together. One cannot put a price tag on the joy one gets from spending time with one’s dear ones.
Diwali is also the busiest shopping season in India. It is true that people spend enormous amounts of money of gifts, sweets and fireworks, but one cannot overlook the boost this Diwali spending gives to the Indian economy. In the same way, Christmas and the associated holiday shopping season bring cheer to the US and several other economies.
National festivals also foster national integration. They invoke a sense of unity among the people. When people celebrate an occasion together they forget about their religious, cultural or other differences.
After examining the situation it is not hard to see why festivals are so important and how they help us stay united. And hence the argument that public celebrations are a waste of money doesn’t hold much water.",7.5,ielts-essay-are-public-celebrations-a-waste-of-money
1213,People do not have enough money to pay internet. Should the governments provide free internet service to everyone?,"Much like the telephone or the television, the internet has become an integral part of our day-to-day existence. However, the internet is expensive and this prevents many people from accessing this limitless source of knowledge and information. This, however, doesn’t mean that the government should provide free internet to everyone.
All over the world, the number of people who use the internet is steadily on the rise and that is hardly surprising. The internet is a vast source of knowledge and entertainment. In fact, having a computer with an internet connection is a bit like having all the books in the world under one’s disposal. The internet is even better because it allows you to find the necessary information in a matter of seconds. The internet also provides entertainment and keeps us up-to-date with the latest happenings in the world. And hence one cannot underestimate the importance of internet.
However, saying that the government should provide free internet to everyone is kind of absurd. In a world where we have to pay for basic necessities like food and medicine, demanding that the internet should be free is a bit ridiculous. It is a useful service but for many people there are far more pressing needs. For example, millions of people across the world still have no access to safe drinking water or electricity. Tens of thousands of people are homeless. A lot of them haven’t even heard about the internet. What they need are the basic necessities of life and not free internet.
After analysing the situation it is not hard to see that the basic necessities of life are far more important than the internet. Of course, the internet is useful, but it is not indispensable. And hence the governments should use their resources to provide the basic amenities rather than giving free internet.",7.5,ielts-sample-essay-should-governments-provide-free-internet
1214,"Nowadays, more and more young unmarried adults are choosing to study and live outside their parents’ homes.  Do you think this trend is positive?","Thanks to urbanization, more and more young and often unmarried adults migrate to cities in search of jobs or a better life style. This trend is largely positive, but it does have a few negative side effects as well.
Let’s start with the positive aspects. When unmarried youngsters live on their own, they learn to become self-reliant. They learn to take care of themselves. They learn to cook, clean and wash. In fact, single men and women living alone in the cities learn all the skills necessary to run a home. They also learn to manage their time and money. They wouldn’t perhaps learn many of these skills if they were living with their parents.
Independence is another plus point. When people live on their own away from their family they get an opportunity to explore and discover themselves. They discover their inherent skills. They learn to cope with challenges. They also learn several social skills.
On the flip side, too much independence can have a negative impact as well especially in the case of single adults who can’t distinguish between right and wrong. The cities are full of traps and young adults are their main targets. In the absence of a guiding voice, many youngsters living alone in the cities can get into bad company. They may also develop bad habits like smoking and drinking because they have no one to fear in the city. They may not develop these habits if they were living with their parents or elder siblings.
After analysing both aspects of the situation it is not hard to see that living on one’s own helps a youngster to grow into a mature and self-sufficient adult. There are some negative aspects as well, but this trend is largely positive and should be encouraged.",7.5,ielts-essay-should-single-adults-be-encouraged-to-study-and-live-away-from-their-parents
1215,Some people believe that giving a weekly allowance will help children to develop good spending habits. Do you agree or disagree?,"In many families it is a common practice for parents to give a weekly allowance to their kids. When I was a kid, my father used to give me a small sum of money every day. I was supposed to spend that money judiciously. Although he never really asked what I was doing with the money, I always made sure that I didn’t waste a single penny. I used that money to buy books and pay tuition fees.
In hind sight, I think his decision to give me a daily allowance was good. That small sum of money gave me a sense of independence. Because I always had a small amount with me, I didn’t have to ask him every time I needed to buy a book or things like that. I also learned the importance of spending money wisely. As I was getting only a small allowance, I had to limit my spending. I had to spend money only on things that was absolutely necessary. So in my opinion, giving your kids a daily or weekly allowance is a good idea.
On the flip side, giving too much money to your kids is bad. Many parents who have high disposable incomes commit this mistake. Kids are too young to understand what is necessary and what isn’t. If they get a lot of money, they are invariably going to splurge. They might even get into harmful habits like smoking, drinking and gambling. So I think what parents should do is to give a small amount that would meet the day-to-day needs of their children. Parents must also monitor what their kids are doing with that money.",7.5,some-people-believe-that-giving-a-weekly-allowance-will-help-children-to-develop-good-spending-habits-do-you-agree-or-disagree
1216,A number of historic buildings have been destroyed. What are the reasons for this? What should be done to preserve these buildings,"Historical buildings are the windows to the past. They tell us a lot of things about our history and civilization. They are the symbols of our rich heritage and must be preserved at any cost. Unfortunately most of these building are in danger. Several of them have already been destroyed. The remaining are also facing the threat of destruction.
Many factors have led to the destruction of historical buildings. The most important among them has been foreign invasion. Structures like palaces, forts and temples were the worst hit by invading foreign troops. For example, numerous Indian temples and palaces were looted and destroyed by foreign rulers who invaded the country during the medieval times. This has also happened in other parts of the world. Another reason was religious. Because the invaders usually believed in another religion, they often thought that it was their responsibility to convert the religious structures of the countries they conquer. As a result of this many Hindu temples were converted into Islamic Mosques and vice versa.
In modern times, the destruction of historical buildings is mainly due to a lack of resources and awareness. Maintaining these structures requires a great deal of time, effort and money. Poor countries cannot always afford this. Government apathy is another factor.
Preservation of these buildings won’t be possible without generating awareness. Organizations like the UNESCO and the media in general can play a huge role in this. We must drive home the fact these buildings belong to the whole of humanity and not just to the nation or community where it is physically located and that it is our duty to preserve these structures for our future generations.",7.5,sample-essay-a-number-of-historic-buildings-have-been-destroyed-what-are-the-reasons-for-this
1217,To what extent do you think governments should be held responsible when problems of homelessness and unemployment arise?,"Countries where social welfare schemes are properly implemented by the governments don’t have high levels of homelessness or unemployment. In fact when a country has a large number of homeless and unemployed people, it is a clear indication that something is wrong with the way it is governed. But can governments be held completely responsible for loss of jobs and homes? Let’s examine.
Both internal and external factors can have a significant effect on a nation’s economy. A good government should be able to control the internal conflicts that might be causing joblessness and homelessness. However, no government in the world can effectively control external affairs. For example, a lot of people lost jobs due to the economic crisis in 2008. Although recession was mainly in the US, its effect was felt all over the globe. In fact, the US recession caused job loss in countries like India and China. It affected India’s booming outsourcing industry. And because it was an external factor, the governments in India or China couldn’t do anything to ease its ramifications.
Nonetheless, there are many things that governments can do to reduce the severity of these problems and protect their citizens. Most governments have enough money in their coffers to ensure basic amenities like food and shelter. Governments collect taxes from the wealthy people. If this money is effectively used it will significantly improve the living standards of the poorer sections of the society. If a government fails to do it, it is either apathetic or inefficient.
In India, for example, the government has launched several schemes to provide housing and employment to people. Although the country still faces these problems, the situation has considerably improved in recent years. This is a clear indication that political willpower and proper governance can improve the economic status of a country and its people.
After analyzing the situation, it is difficult to arrive at the conclusion that governments can be held completely responsible for problems like job loss and unemployment. Of course, the governments have a role to play in easing these problems, but factors outside the control of a government too can upset a nation’s financial status.",7.5,should-governments-be-held-responsible-for-unemployment
1218,Some scientists claim that they can tell whether a child will become a criminal by examining his brain at the age of 3. Do you agree that crime is a product of human nature? Do you think we can stop children from becoming criminals?,"Is there any criminal who cannot be reformed? Are criminal tendencies hardwired into the brain? Some scientists claim that they can detect criminal tendencies in a child by examining him or her at the age of 3. Is it true? Are some people born criminals? Can’t we stop our kids from becoming criminals? Let’s examine.
Conventional wisdom has always preached that the most significant factor that influences character formation is the upbringing a child receives. If he is brought up by good parents, then he is also going to be good when he grows up. In the same way, children surrounded by criminals during their formative years are more likely to exhibit criminal tendencies. That means character is something that we can shape.
However, none of these are absolute rules. In fact, there are several exceptions. Children born to kind parents can sometimes grow into cruel, unsympathetic adults. In this case, all that good upbringing they received from their parents couldn’t reform them. In the same way, children born to hardcore criminals can sometimes grow into sympathetic, conscientious adults. They are unlikely to have received a good upbringing, but that didn’t prevent them from becoming good adults.
In other words although upbringing and education play a significant role in shaping a person’s character, they aren’t the only factors that decide whether a child will grow into a responsible adult or not. In fact, there could be quite a few other factors which are equally important and some of them could be biological. If that is indeed so, then the scientists who claim that by brain mapping a child they can detect his criminal tendencies might be correct. Even so, it is too early to claim that the structure of a person’s brain is the only factor that determiners his character. It could be one of the factors, but it can’t be the only factor because history is replete with examples of criminals who were reformed by love and kindness. Even wild animals tend to respond amiably when we treat them with love.
After analyzing the situation it is not hard to see that a person’s inherent nature or the structure of his brain can play a role in determining his character. However, it would be wrong to assume that crime is merely a product of our nature. It is equally wrong to claim that there is nothing that we can do to prevent our kids from becoming criminals.",7.5,sample-essay-can-scientists-detect-criminal-tendencies-in-a-child-by-mapping-his-brain-at-age-3
1219,"Some people believe that museums should entertain people, while others are of the opinion that their purpose is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Sample answer
What exactly is the purpose of a museum? Is a museum supposed to entertain people? Some people believe so, but others are of the opinion that the main purpose of a museum is to educate. Which view is correct? Let’s examine.
A museum is a building in which objects pertaining to art, history, science etc are displayed. Although the reason that draws people to museums can be different, the truth is that almost all of us are interested in the educational value they provide. If people are only interested in entertainment, they are more likely to visit a cinema theatre than a museum. Therefore, the argument that museums exist with the purpose of entertaining people is hard to support.
The best thing about a museum is that it provides visitors an opportunity to actually see and perhaps touch objects they may have only heard about. A good historical museum has the power to take people on a journey down the centuries. It is a bit like reliving the past. In the same way arts museums offer people an opportunity to see great works of art in person. It is not an experience that a television can provide.
After analyzing both views it is felt that the main purpose of a museum is to educate rather than entertain. Of course, nothing should prevent a museum from keeping its visitors entertained using modern technology. For example, some science and technology museums now provide a demonstrational experience for their visitors. This is not only entertaining but also educative. But establishing a museum with the sole objective of providing entertainment will defeat the very purpose of its existence.",7.5,academic-task-2-essay-as-seen-in-iran
1220,"Nowadays, people are spending increasingly large amounts of money on their marriage parties.  Many people feel large and expensive weddings cause problems for the bride and groom.  Do you agree?  Use personal examples in your response.","Lavish wedding parties are the norm in many parts of the world. For example, in India parents don’t mind spending large amounts of their hard earned money on their children’s wedding. In fact, Indian parents start planning and saving for their daughter’s wedding from the day she is born.
In the Middle East, where arranged marriages are common, the cost of wedding is borne by the entire family. In the west, where arranged marriages are uncommon, the bride and the groom bear the cost of wedding. In any case, insane amounts of money are being spent on weddings. Expensive weddings cause problems not only for the bride and the groom but also for their families. Does that mean every marrying couple should opt for simple wedding ceremonies? Well, let’s see.
There is no denying the fact that a wedding is an occasion to celebrate. After all, it happens just once in a lifetime. The problem arises when people opt for weddings that they cannot afford. Spending borrowed money on a wedding is definitely not a wise idea. It will unnecessarily put a financial burden of the new couple even before they start their life together. Worse still, in India where dowry is a huge social problem many parents don’t prefer having a girl child because they cannot afford to pay huge amounts of dowry.  In worst cases, it even leads to female infanticide. Parents abort a girl child even before she is born because they don’t want to spend millions of money on her wedding when she grows up.
After analyzing the situation, it is not hard to see that lavish weddings do more harm than good. While marrying couples should be allowed to choose the kind of wedding they should have, they should be under no compulsion to throw lavish parties that they cannot afford.",7.5,ielts-sample-essay-people-now-spend-a-lot-of-money-on-their-wedding
1221,A lot of older people are suffering from loneliness these days.  They also lack physical fitness.  What do you think are the reasons for these problems?  Can you think of possible solutions?  Use personal examples if applicable.,"Loneliness is a major problem that plagues older people all over the world. People in their seventies and eighties have always had their share of problems. But the kind of loneliness and associated problems that they experience today are much worse than what older people had to endure twenty or thirty years ago. What are the reasons for these problems? How can these problems be solved? Let’s examine.
Loneliness is not a new phenomenon. People of all ages and nationalities face it from time to time. While loneliness can affect all people, the older people are the worst hit by this problem. Part of this problem can be attributed to the rise of nuclear families. Families all over the world are becoming smaller and smaller. While youngsters who spend a considerable part of their away from home have plenty of opportunities to socialize, their older parents and grandparents have few outing options which severely limit their chances of interacting with other people.  Old age is also a period of physical inactivity. Few older people even bother to step out of their home.
To overcome loneliness older people must keep themselves engaged in meaningful activities. They can go a walk in the morning or in the evening. It will give them physical exercise. It will also give them an opportunity to meet and interact with other people. They can join clubs or they can pursue other interests. By keeping themselves constantly engaged in something or the other they can overcome loneliness. What is more, when they are physically fit they will feel better about themselves and that will add a whole new layer of meaning to life.",7.5,ielts-sample-essay-a-lot-of-older-people-suffer-from-loneliness-these-days
1222,"These days, many jobs require people to travel and this is disrupting many families.  What effects do traveling parents have on their children?","The advent of globalization has virtually reduced the world to a village where geographical boundaries are becoming irrelevant. Major multinational companies now have offices in almost all parts of the world. And to run these offices, they employ people from virtually every corner of the globe. Many of these jobs require people to travel extensively.  When parents have to go on frequent business trips, it can have a very adverse effect on the overall well-being of their children.
During their formative years, children need the presence of an adult role model. It is essential for their academic as well as emotional development. When parents travel excessively, they fail to spend quality time with their children. Of course, they provide financial security for their children but there is more to parenting than giving children ample pocket money.
Children who are raised in a single parent household often find it difficult to develop healthy relationships with their other parent who is mostly away from the home. Children who are raised in families where both parents are away on duty face even more problems. Studies have proved that children coming from families where one or both parents are always absent are more likely to get into bad company and that is quite understandable. When they do not get the love and attention they deserve from their parents, they may turn to other sources. Some might end up spending the whole of their time in front of the TV. These kids will grow into lethargic, obese adults. Others might turn to their friends or peers for guidance and solace which increases their chances of developing bad habits. And when these children grow up into adults, they may have trouble forming good relationships with their children. Worse still, the constant absence of a partner may lead to the disruption of a nuclear family which can have a devastating effect on the child.
After analyzing the situation, it is felt that parents who travel excessively do more harm than good to their children. It may not be possible to completely avoid work-related travel but parents of young children should try to reduce the time away from home as much as possible.",7.5,ielts-essay-what-effects-do-traveling-parents-have-on-their-children
1223,Some cultures value old age while others value young age.  Discuss both attitudes and express your opinion.,"Sample answer
There is a popular belief that age brings wisdom and that probably explains why some cultures value old age. On the flip side, old age is also a period of increasing dependence. Old people can never match the dynamism of their younger counterparts. So which age is better? Let’s examine.
Aged people have more experience behind them. They have seen more life. As a result of this they have a deeper understanding of the problems of the world and are more capable of making judicious decisions. In the Indian culture aged men and women command great respect in the society. Theirs tend to be the last word in matters of utmost importance. Young men and women in the family may have better educational qualifications, but they still listen to their aged parents and grandparents.
Consider the case of world leaders. Most of them are men and women in their sixties or seventies. They are chosen leaders for their ability to handle situations with more maturity. All over the world, people who occupy higher positions aren’t exactly young. Youngsters may be full of energy and enthusiasm, but they lack experience and the maturity that comes with it. They are also more likely to get carried away by their emotions or excitement.
On the flip side, old age is a period of increasing dependence. As people age, their faculties may get impaired. They may have trouble remembering things or taking sound decisions. Unfortunately, this is an inevitable part of the process of aging. People also become much less productive in their twilight years.
After analyzing the situation, it is felt that both ages have their merits and demerits. Age may bring wisdom, but it also makes people dependent. The truth is that no society can survive without the energy and enthusiasm of its youngsters. And if they receive the guidance of their aged counterparts, they will be able to work wonders.",7.5,ielts-essay-some-cultures-value-old-age
1224,Many people choose to work or live abroad because of the higher standards of living they can find outside their home country.  Do you think this brings more advantages or disadvantages to the people who follow this path?,"The standard of living in developed countries is considerably better than that in underdeveloped or developing countries and that is what prompts most people to emigrate. People who choose to live abroad almost always come from underdeveloped or developing countries where they do not have enough opportunities for career or personal growth.
When talented youngsters move abroad, they get the kind of salary that matches their qualifications. They may not get similar opportunities in the country of their birth. By moving abroad, they will also be able to provide world class education to their children. Another advantage is the availability of excellent healthcare in the developed world. It is a well-known fact that people in the first world countries live longer than those in the third world countries. People who immigrate to these countries may also enjoy this benefit.
On the flip side, when the talented youth move to other countries in search of better jobs, it creates a dearth of talent in their mother country. While this is a disadvantage, it has another side to it. A large number of Indians now work and live abroad. The money that they sent to their loved ones in India makes a significant contribution to the Indian economy. According to some statistics, annually India receives over 50 billion USD in foreign remittance. That’s a huge amount that can significantly improve the quality of a living in a country. Foreign remittance, for example, is the backbone of the Kerala economy (a south Indian state) where the literacy and longevity rates are comparable to those in the developed world.
After analyzing both sides of the situation it is felt that moving abroad for a better job has more advantages than disadvantages.

Discuss both views using personal examples.","The way people consume professional sporting events varies from person to person. Some like to watch sports events on television. Others, on the other hand, are more interested in going to the stadium and watch the event in person. Is one approach better than the other? Let’s examine.
When you attend a live sporting event in person, you actually get an opportunity to participate in the event. You get to see your favourite sports persons in flesh and blood. That is probably why some people like to go to a stadium. The excitement that you get when you are part of a cheering crowd is not something that you can experience when you watch the same event at home sitting in front of a TV. In my opinion, it is this eagerness to be a part of the spectacle that draws people to the stadium. After all, watching an event in person is not exactly the same as watching its broadcast on TV.
On the other hand, watching a live sporting event in person does involve some risks. Certain sporting events like racing can cause injury to the spectators as well as to the participants. The exorbitant ticket prices are another problem that discourages people from going to the stadium. Watching a sporting event on TV, on the other hand, costs nothing. You can do it in the comforts of your home: you don’t have to sit in the hot sun sweating. And if you still need company, you can invite your friends and create a mini stadium-like atmosphere at home.
After analyzing the situation, I couldn’t find anything to prove that watching sports events in person is better than watching them on TV or vice –versa. It is actually about personal preference and affordability. The truth is that most people who find contentment in watching a sporting event on television will definitely appreciate it if they get an opportunity to watch it in person. In most cases the factors that discourage people from going to the stadium is not a lack of interest but the huge price of the ticket and the limited availability of seats. If tickets are available and they have the money to spend, they are more likely to watch it in person than on TV.",7.5,ielts-essay-while-some-people-like-to-a-live-sporting-event-others-prefer-to-watch-it-on-television

1227,The following question was asked on an IELTS writing test held in Australia in January 2012. This question is taken from www.ielts-blog.com,"Model answer
Following one’s instincts is definitely a good idea as long as one is capable of facing the consequences. The question is whether young children should be allowed to follow their instincts. Some people believe that young children should have the freedom to act according to their instincts. Others however disagree. Which view is right? Let’s examine.
Young children have highly impressionable minds. They learn by imitating. Do they really have the capacity to take wise decisions of their own? Most of the time, their actions and decisions are influenced by what they see and hear. If parents do not guide them and teach them to distinguish between the right and the wrong, they will invariably fall into big problems.
Of course, allowing children to follow their instincts has some advantages: it will help them nourish their innate capabilities. They learn to be independent and responsible. They also learn to face the consequences of their actions. It is a huge learning experience for them.
On the flip side, young children lack experience. They are also too naive to understand the consequences of their actions. So if they are allowed to do whatever they like, problems are bound to arise. Of course, they may learn from these experiences and make better decisions in the future. But this ‘learn from one’s own mistakes policy’ is not always practical in the case of small children.
What’s more, children are an integral part of the society and the society has certain norms. There are certain things that are considered appropriate and certain things that are considered inappropriate. The freedom to follow one’s own instincts must not clash with the values of the society. Children, on their own, are unlikely to have the knowledge to understand these sorts of things.
After analyzing the situation, it is felt that allowing young children to follow their instincts and act accordingly will do them more harm than good because they do not have the knowledge or capacity to take sound decisions of their own. They need the guidance of their parents and teachers to grow into responsible adults who can make valuable contributions to the society.",7.5,ielts-sample-essay-should-children-be-allowed-to-follow-their-instincts
1228,"Some people believe that factories and private tour operators should bear the cost of cleaning up environmental pollution, instead of the government. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?","Model Answer
Environmental pollution is one of the major problems that we face today. The causes of environmental pollution are many. Vehicles are an important source of pollutants. So are factories. The fast growth of tourism has also led to the polluting of many beautiful regions of the world. Needless to say, some people believe that companies and private tour operators should be asked to bear the cost of cleaning up. After all, they play a very significant role in polluting the environment. But is it fair? Let’s examine.
There is no denying the fact that factories play a very significant role in polluting the environment. Factories release poisonous gases and other waste products that are harmful to the environment. Sometimes these waste products which are full of hazardous substances are simply dumped into oceans and rivers. In many countries there are strict rules and regulations that require factories to clean up the waste they produce. However, in many parts of the world no such rules exist and industrialization is regarded as a necessary evil. Of course, factories generate jobs. They also produce goods to satiate our needs. But that doesn’t mean that they should be allowed to pollute the planet. In fact, if factories are held responsible for cleaning up the pollution they cause, they will adopt newer technologies that are less polluting.
Tour operators can be held responsible for the pollution in many tourist spots. Some of the most beautiful regions in the world that attract millions of visitors every year have become some sort of dumping ground for waste. Plastic bottles and carry bags that visitors throw around have made these places unclean and unhygienic. Unlike pollution caused by factories, this problem can be solved to a great extent by making tour operators responsible for cleaning up. When they realize that they will have to do the cleaning up, they will definitely take measures that ensure responsible behaviour from their clients.
On the flip side, tourism and factories are not the only causes of pollution. There are several others too. For example, vehicles are the number one source of atmospheric pollution. Air travel is another. Even the refrigerator that we use at home contributes towards polluting the environment.
After analyzing the situation, it is not hard to see the role factories and tour operators play in polluting the environment. So it is only fair to ask them to bear the cost of cleaning up. On the flip side, they are not the only causes of pollution. So there is no point in expecting them to bear the total cost. After all, both tourism and industries are good for the economic growth of a nation. An ideal solution is to divide the cost of cleaning up between governments and factories or tour operators.",7.5,ielts-model-essay-do-you-think-that-factories-and-tour-operators-should-bear-the-cost-of-cleaning-up-pollution
1229,Writing task 2 (an essay),"Model answer
Artists are everywhere. They provide entertainment and that makes them the darlings of the media. They are on the billboards, in the newspapers and on the television and internet. This constant visibility makes them popular with the masses. Is it true that artists grab more attention than scientists and inventors? Let’s examine.
Scientists and inventors contribute a lot more to the well-being of the society than artists. Technical innovations have considerably improved the quality of living. Breakthroughs in medical science have increased longevity. Almost all of the comforts that we enjoy today would not have been available without advancements in science and technology. This, however, doesn’t mean that the people who work behind these inventions and discoveries are household names. Except for a few like Edison or Einstein, most scientists are not well-known public figures. That is probably because they don’t have hyperactive PR agencies to keep them stay in the news. This under popularity might discourage several bright minds from pursuing a career in science and technology.
Artists, on the other hand, have to stay in the news. Their success is measured in terms of their visibility and popularity. Famous writers have no difficulty selling their books. In the same way, albums released by famous singers sell like hot cakes. Part of this popularity is a result of their conscious efforts to stay in the news. Most artists, for example, have hired public relations agencies. These PR companies work with the sole objective of making their clients popular.
After analyzing the situation, it is not hard to see that artists get more attention than scientists. It is not easy to say whether this is a positive trend or a negative trend. There is also nothing to claim that it is the over popularity of artists that makes scientists less popular. Arts and science are two distinct fields. One meets the necessities of man while the other provides entertainment.

Artists are the custodians of a nation’s cultural heritage. They determine how the nation thinks and acts and keep it sane. Are artists valuable to the society? Let’s examine.
Artists like writers, musicians and painters influence the way a nation thinks. They act as the guiding lights for the society. No one can feel the pulse of a nation like its artists. And no one can be better representatives of a nation than its artists.
Much of what we know about our forefathers, we learned from the works of great writers and painters. They preserved history for us.  Writers like Homer, Dante and Shakespeare not only entertained the masses with their writings, but also painted a realistic picture of the era they lived in. If Shakespeare wasn’t born we would perhaps have known very little about the life and values of the people who lived in the Victorian era. What Shakespeare and Dante did for us, today’s writers will do for the coming generations.
Great works of art inspire the soul. They encourage us to lead better, responsible lives. Artists often act as the voice of wisdom. They help us to distinguish between the right and the wrong. They protect the society from rotting and make it a better place to live in.
Artists were the catalysts behind every revolution that changed the world. They were the first to sow the seeds of unrest. The Russian Resolution would not have been possible without the contribution of the Russian writers. In the same way, the Renaissance would not have been possible without the artists of Europe.
Artists are often the first to raise their voice against injustice. Through their works they highlight the problems plaguing the society and urge the administration to do its duty.
After analyzing the situation it is not hard to see that artists are valuable to the society. Their contribution to the society cannot be measured in terms of monetary benefits. But the truth is that artists are the forces that keep the society civilized and humane.",7.5,ielts-essay
1231,Question,"Model Answer
Do teachers require professional training in teaching? Some people think that it is absolutely necessary. Others, on the other hand, believe that teaching capabilities can be acquired with experience. Which argument is true? Let’s examine.
Most schools now prefer employing teachers who have a degree in teaching and that makes sense. A professional qualification in teaching equips teachers with all the skills necessary for teaching. A trained teacher has already received basic lessons in children’s psychology. He or she is already familiar with the most modern teaching methods. As a result of this they can do justice to their job from the day they start teaching.
The method of teaching has changed considerably over the years. Schools now employ several modern techniques that are not exactly easy to understand. If a teacher has not received training he or she will have trouble incorporating these techniques into their teaching. That means schools will need to provide training to them.
On the other hand, like every other skill, teaching skills too can be acquired with experience. If a teacher is good at learning from her everyday experiences at school, it wouldn’t take her more than a year or two to acquire the teaching capabilities of someone who has acquired professional training.
Looking at both sides of the argument, it is not hard to see that though teaching capabilities can be acquired with experience it takes time. And until a teacher acquires enough experience, he or she will not have the competence expected of a good teacher. In other words, trained teachers are better than those who have received little or no training at all.",7.5,ielts-writing-task-2-do-you-think-that-training-is-necessary-to-be-a-good-teacher
1232,Youngsters now admire and imitate media and sports personalities even though they do not always set a good example. Do you think that this is a positive or negative development?,"Hero worship is in our blood. In this day and age, media and sports personalities are the heroes. They are everywhere – on the billboards, in the newspapers, on TV and internet. This omnipresence has earned them widespread fame and millions of fans who try to imitate everything that they do. Is this a positive development? Let’s examine.
Admiring film and sports personalities is nothing unusual but unfortunately it isn’t always good. A large number of our celebrities don’t set good examples. Many of them are known for their extravagant and wasteful lifestyles. They don’t mind spending millions of dollars on shopping. They wear expensive designer garments and drive super luxury cars. They earn millions of dollars every year so it doesn’t really matter to them. Unfortunately, they inspire middle class people, who can hardly afford this, to adopt the same life style.
Wafer thin models promote unhealthy eating habits. Anorexia has become a major health issue these days. Models and film stars who look nearly perfect because of Photoshop effects have given rise to a generation obsessed with looking perfect. Even extramarital relationships are now considered perfectly acceptable because several celebrities have multiple partners.
Celebrities are human beings too and they have their own weaknesses. Just because they happen to excel in a particular field, we can’t expect them to be paragons of virtue. They are influential people and it would be great if they can be good role models, but the truth is that that is where most of them fail.
On the other hand, we do have something to learn from these famous people. They are achievers. Many of them had humble beginnings. Still, they rose to fame because of their determination and hard work. We can also achieve the same if we make a sincere attempt.
After analyzing the situation, it is not hard to see that admiring and imitating film and sports personalities who do not set a good example is bad. Simply admiring them is alright.

1233,Some believe that students who fear their teachers excel academically.  Others believe students work better when they have a friendly relationship with their teacher.  Discuss these views and provide your opinion.,"Different teachers have different style of teaching. Some believe in instilling a sense of fear in their students. Others are more interested in having friendly relationships with their students. Which style is better? Is it true that students who fear their teachers tend to do better in their studies? Let’s examine.
Not every student has enough motivation to do well in his or her studies. A large number of school going students don’t even understand the need for good grades. They go to school simply because their parents send them there. They will not get good grades if they do not have a teacher who punishes them whenever they make mistakes. It is actually this fear of punishment that acts as an incentive to study harder. While teachers who frighten their students might seem like a bad idea, there is no denying the fact that they act as a motivation to work harder and harder.
Teachers who like to be friendly with their students are good for well-motivated students. They encourage them to experiment and explore. The American education system is well known for its friendly relationship between teachers and students. This style of teaching may not be suitable for less motivated students, but one has got to admit that the US has produced the most number of innovators and achievers.  Needless to say, the US is the most popular destination for overseas students.
Looking at both sides, it is felt that teachers who instill some fear are good for less motivated students. Well-motivated and enterprising students, on the other hand, tend to do better with friendly teachers who encourage them to experiment and explore.",7.5,ielts-essay-some-believe-that-students-who-fear-their-teachers-excel-academically
1234,"Some people believe that allowing multinational companies to open offices and factories in developing countries is good for their economic growth of those countries. Others, however, believe that governments should ask foreign companies to shut shop and help local companies to grow. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Model Answer
Some people believe that developing countries should allow and encourage multinational companies to open offices and factories in their countries because it is good for their economic growth. Others are of the opinion that multinational companies aren’t good for the growth of developing countries. They believe that governments in these countries should encourage the growth of local companies. Both sides of the problem will be discussed in this essay before a conclusion is arrived at.
Multinational companies (MNCs) have business interests in almost all parts of the world. Most MNCs have their headquarters in developed countries. A well-known example is Coca-Cola. It is a known fact that multinational companies contribute towards the growth of global economy. They generate jobs and jobs are good for any economy.
On the flip side, MNCs promote capitalism. They encourage the accumulation of wealth in a few hands. Multinational companies are often accused of exploiting the natural and human resources of developing countries. For example, most of the world’s gadgets are built in developing countries like China and Taiwan. Why do American MNCs like Apple and HP prefer having their gadgets built in these countries?  It is simple: the labour cost in these countries is pretty low as compared to the labour cost in a country like the US or Canada. The products thus made by these underpaid employees who work overtime in substandard working conditions are then exported to other parts of the world where they are sold for high profit margins. That means wealth is generated in one country, but its actual beneficiaries are people living in another part of the world. Doesn’t this amount to the exploitation of human resources?
Now let’s take a look at another side of the problem. Besides exploiting man-power MNCs also exploit natural resources. Multinationals like Coca-Cola and Pepsi have always been accused of exploiting the underground water resources of developing countries. Drought is a major problem in areas where they have built factories. Why do these companies prefer having their bottling plants in developing countries? Because the labour rules and regulations in many developed countries make it difficult for them to obtain necessary permissions to set up plants. In a bid to attract foreign companies and generate more jobs, many developing countries have liberal laws which aren’t always good for the preservation of their natural resources.
So what is the solution? Can developing countries solve these problems by encouraging the development of local companies? Of course – to a certain extent.  Local companies, too, can generate jobs. Because most of these companies only operate in the country of their origin they don’t cause major exploitation of human or natural resources. What’s more, the wealth generated by the operation of these companies benefit the country where they operate from.
When we look at both sides of the issue, it is not difficult to see that encouraging the growth of local companies have several advantages. It doesn’t mean that multinational companies should be asked to shut shop and leave. They, too, should be allowed to operate. But encouraging them at the cost of local companies is certainly bad for the economies of developing countries.",7.5,ielts-essay-are-multinational-companies-good-for-the-economies-of-developing-countries
1235,"Economic growth has helped to improve standards of living all over the world.  However, some research shows that people in developing countries are happier with this trend than people in developed countries.  Explain why you think this is.","There is no denying the fact that economic growth has improved the standard of living all over the world. However, growth in global economy may mean different things to different people. For people in the developing world it means better opportunities for personal and professional growth. More and more people in developing countries such as India and China now earn more than enough to lead comfortable lives. Now they have high disposable incomes that make it possible for them to lead luxurious lives. They can now buy the latest gadgets, travel to the most exotic places on earth and own luxury apartments and cars. Their children now get world class education and healthcare. None of these would have been possible if the economy wasn’t growing. Needless to say, for people in the developing world growth in the economy is a positive development.
Now let us see what global economic growth means to people in the developed world. Majority of people in the developed world already lead comfortable lives. They already possess disposable income and the recent growth in the global economy hasn’t really done anything to further improve their standard of living. On the other hand, they now face stiff competition from their peers in the developing countries. Their market share has started eroding. They are no longer the most sought after candidates for jobs even in their own countries. Worse still, more and more jobs now get outsourced to the developing world, where the cost of labour is low compared to that in the West.  As a result of this people in the developed world are now losing their jobs. Needless to say, they aren’t all that happy with this sudden spurt in global economy.
The facts given above should explain why researchers feel that people in the developing countries are happier with the growth in global economy than the people in the developed world.

1236,The number of older people is increasing. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?,"Thanks to improved living standards and universal accessibility of medical facilities, more and more people now live to be seventy or eighty. This is an achievement worthy of celebration because longevity is a positive thing. It is an indication that all those social welfare schemes are bearing fruit. But what exactly happens when the number of older people in the society increases? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend? Let’s take a look at both sides of the issue.
Much of medical science is concerned with ways to increase the life span of a person. Longevity is one of the factors that determine the livability of a country. In short, countries where the people enjoy good longevity are thought to be much better than countries that have poor longevity. Part of this is due to the fact that longevity is a measure of the effectiveness of other wellness factors. The fact that more and more people now cross the 60 or 70 milestone is a good indication that living standards have considerably improved. And that is a good thing.
The rise in the older population has other benefits too. Older people are far more experienced and knowledgeable. They have what it takes to guide the younger generation in the right direction.
On the other hand, the older people aren’t necessarily productive. Most of them don’t work or earn. Older people also need special care and medical attention. In most cases they are dependent on their children or other close relatives either due to financial problems or due to physical inabilities.
Looking at both sides of the situation, it is felt that although the rise in the number older people is a positive sign, it is not without its drawbacks. We can’t aspire for a society wherein older people outnumber younger people.

1237,"While some secondary schools provide general education in a range of traditional subjects, others offer specialized training in a few subjects. Which approach is better for children and why?","Model Answer
Some schools provide general education in a range of subjects, while others offer specialized training in a few disciplines. Which approach is better? In this essay we will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches before arriving at a conclusion.
Why do parents send their kids to schools? Is it just for making them employable? If that was so, then specialized education in a discipline of their choice would have been enough. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
A school is not an institution built with the sole objective of churning out workers. The purpose of schooling is to turn kids into well-rounded, knowledgeable youngsters. And that is the advantage of studying at a school offering general education in all subjects. Children coming from such schools tend to be more knowledgeable than children taught at specialized schools. They know something about everything and that is better than knowing everything about just one thing. So you might ask: Why should a child destined to be an engineer learn grammar or history? Well, a child may be destined to be an engineer, but learning a bit of grammar will help her to express her ideas better in both speech and writing. A little knowledge of history will help her better understand her country and its heritage. The truth is that general knowledge never hurts.
Does that mean that specialized education is bad or unnecessary? Well, specialized education isn’t bad at all. It improves the employability of a student. But it isn’t absolutely necessary for a child to start receiving specialized education at the school level. It can be imparted at the university level. What’s more, at that point, a student will have discovered where his or her interests are. And then it will be easier for them to make a more informed choice about their career. A student who begins schooling, on the other hand, knows nothing about her tastes. She is more likely to learn disciplines chosen by her parents. This isn’t necessarily good for her.
Looking at both sides, it is felt that schools offering general education are better than those offering specialized education is a few subjects. Not that specialized education is bad, but it isn’t necessary for a young learner.",7.5,ielts-essay-are-schools-providing-specialized-training-better-than-those-providing-general-education
1238,"Some people believe that advertisements targeting children may have negative effects on them, and suggest banning such advertisements as a solution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Children constitute a sizable section of the population. Needless to say a large number of advertisements on TV and other forms of media are directly targeted at children. Is this a positive trend? Does it have any negative effects on kids? Some people believe that it is bad for kids. Well, let’s see if there is some truth in that argument.
Children are ‘soft targets’. Advertisements targeting kids usually are of products they have an inherent interest in. For example ads for cookies, chocolates, health drinks and toys almost always portray kids. Children are also highly impressionable. It is easy to convince them that a certain brand of cookies or chocolates is better than similar products from another brand. It is also easy to convince them that using a certain product is ‘cool’.
Brands all over the world are trying hard to expand their reach and as such they are keen on exploring all possible options. That is where kids come into the plot. In today’s nuclear families children play a huge role in decision making. They decide what they want to eat or wear. They might even decide what their parents should wear to work.  One could argue that this is some form of a children’s empowerment. Unfortunately that is not the case.
Children are too young to decide what is good or bad for them. Take for instance, the ads for instant noodles and potato chips: they are now being marketed as health foods. The target audience of these ads is mostly kids. Advertisements, too, portray kids gorging on them. These ads give the impression that consuming junk foods on a regular basis is perfectly OK when, in fact, it has serious impact on health. There are also ads that promote unhealthy rivalry between kids.
So what is the solution? Will banning these ads solve the problem? Of course, it will – to a certain extent.  It is true that besides being a marketing tool, ads are educative. Children can learn a lot of things from them. Therefore banning all ads targeting kids might be immature. However, it is essential that the government bans ads that can have a negative impact on the emotional or physical well-being of kids.",7.5,ielts-essay-some-people-believe-that-advertisements-targeting-children-have-negative-effect-on-them
1239,"Most people watch foreign films first, before locally produced films. Why is that so? If the government in your country decides to invest in the film industry, will you support them to do so and why?","Model Answer
The fact that a film produced in one country gets released in another country is an indication that it is a good film which is likely to interest people from all over the world. When I think of foreign films what come to my mind are Hollywood films.
I think the popularity of Hollywood films and foreign films in general can be attributed to the fact that they use the most modern technology. What is more, these films are produced by big companies that have the money and the means to generate huge publicity for them. Today, we all know that marketing is what decides the fate of a product – be it a film, a book or a gadget. So I am not surprised that these films tend to do well overseas.
Locally produced films, on the other hand, are usually produced by small production houses that can’t generate a great deal of hype. What’s more, these films often have familiar storylines and backdrops that may not interest some people. That probably explains why most people watch foreign films before locally produced ones.
As for the government investment in the film industry, well, I think that is a fine idea. I don’t think that the government should produce commercial films with the sole objective of making money. Instead, it can produce films that carry a message. You can’t expect big or small production houses to make such films because they are not always commercially viable. Because the government doesn’t lack money or means it can produce such films for the welfare of the society.",7.5,ielts-essay-why-do-people-watch-foreign-films-first-before-local-films
1240,Some people think it is our moral duty to help poor people.  Some people think that big amounts of money do not reach the poor.  Discuss and give your opinion.,"Model Answer
There is no denying the fact that it is our moral duty to help the poor and the needy. Every religion in the world asks its believers to help those in need. Needless to say, many people help the poor by donating money to charities. But is that enough to eradicate poverty and suffering from the world? Does the money we donate reach the hands of the people who actually need it? Many people believe that it doesn’t. Let’s see if there is any truth in that argument.
For most people, charity means making generous donations to governmental and non-governmental organizations working for the poor. You can’t blame them. Only a few people have the time or drive to engage in social work. The rest of us simply donate money.  It would have been enough if the money thus donated had reached the poor and the needy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t happen so. Only a fraction of the amount reaches people who actually need it. The rest reaches the hands of the corrupt and greedy officials who work for these organizations.
That, however, doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t help the poor at all. While it is true that many organizations and individuals working for the poor are corrupt to the core, there are several exceptions too. Take for instance, the case of Mother Teresa. She single-handedly proved that one person can make a difference to the lives of millions. The Missionaries of Charities, the organization she founded, is still changing the lives of the poor in Calcutta. There are several other examples too. Organizations like these can’t survive without the help of the public who donate time and money for the cause.
It is therefore felt that although large amounts of money do not reach the poor, we cannot refrain from donating at all. Instead, we must try to eliminate corruption by striving for greater degree of transparency. We must also donate time for the cause we believe in whenever that is possible.",7.5,ielts-sample-essay-some-people-think-that-it-is-our-moral-duty-to-help-the-poor
1241,"Police officers carry guns and that is part of their job. They are entrusted with the job of enforcing law and order in the society. When criminals carry guns, can we expect our police force to carry out their duty without the help of guns?
Police officers do inspire the society. Children, especially, have a fascination for the police uniform and the gun. Does this cause an increase in violence in the society? Well, that is debatable.","Now let’s take a look at the other side of the argument. The duty of a police officer is to enforce law and order in the society. During the execution of their job, they face a lot of challenges. They have to deal with people of different kinds. How can we expect an unarmed police officer to effectively deal with a situation that might itself be violent? The gun, though it may be a sign of violence, is a necessity in situations like these. It also provides some security to the lives of our police force. When criminals are armed, police officers too need to be armed. That is essential for the effective execution of their job.
Looking at both sides of the argument, it is safe to assume that the gun is a necessary evil which the police force can’t do away with. What we need to do to reduce the incidences of violence is to create awareness about their ill-effects.

1242,"In some countries, grandparents play a significant role in bringing up children. Is it good or bad?","Model Answer
It is true that in some countries grandparents play a significant role in bringing up children. This trend has both positive and negative sides. Let’s look at the positive side first.
In countries like India a normal family consists of parents, grandparents and children. It might even include members like uncles and aunts. In families where both parents work, it is the grandparents who look after the kids when their Dads and Moms are away. This is a good thing. Parents can go to their workplace without having to worry about the safety of their children. The grandparents, too, benefit from this arrangement. They don’t have to spend the last decades of their life in solitude. It is good for their overall wellbeing.
Studies have proved that children coming from families where they have the company of their grandparents have better social skills. They are better at interacting with other children. They also feel more secure and are less likely to get into bad habits or fall into depression. Grandparents also play a significant role in keeping the children rooted in their values and cultures. In a country like India, it is quite common for kids to be brought up on mythological stories that they hear from their grandparents. These moral stories build the foundation of their character.
Now let’s take a look at the negative side of this trend. Grandparents belong to the older generation. Some of the values that they inculcate into the children may not resonate well with the values of the modern world they have to live in. Grandparents also tend to be over indulgent; they don’t always bother to discipline the kids when they do something mischievous. This could create problems in their normal development as responsible adults. Nonetheless, these are minor issues that pale in comparison with the benefits that children get when they are brought up by their grandparents.
After looking at both sides of the question, it is safe to assume that it is generally good for the children to be brought up by their grandparents.",7.5,ielts-essay-is-it-good-for-children-to-be-brought-up-by-their-grandparents
1243,"Of late, there has been a steady rise in in the number of teenagers having social problems. Many people believe that it is because parents don’t spend enough time with their children due to their work commitments. Do you agree or disagree?","Model Answer
Families where both parents work are the norm these days and for good reason. The cost of living is rising. When both parents work, it ensures economic security. Another reason behind this trend is that women now have the same educational qualification as men. Naturally, they want to work and earn.
Double income households are good for the national economy. But this trend has some downsides too.
When both parents work, they don’t get to spend time with their children. It will not be a big problem in the joint family system. But now many families are nuclear without a proper support system. Working parents, particularly those living in cities, have to leave their children in day-care centers where they don’t get the love and guidance they need to grow into responsible adults. As a result of this many of these children develop behavioral problems. They are also the ones who are more likely to get into bad habits like smoking, drinking and drug abuse.
It therefore goes without saying that parents who work too much are doing more harm than good to their children.
Does this mean that stay-at-home parents are better than working parents? Well, not really. Quitting a job and staying at home may not solve the problem. Instead, what parents need to do is to ensure the quality of the time that they spend with their children. By showing an active interest in their children’s whereabouts parents can ensure that their children don’t feel neglected. The good news is that it doesn’t take a lot of time or effort to show that you care.

1244,"In modern times, young adult are spending less time with their families and more time with their friends. Why has this change occurred? Do you think parents should force their children to spend more time at home?","It is argued that at present many juveniles prefer to spend more time with their peers than their parents. The main reason for this trend is the age gap, and I do not think that mothers and fathers should compel their children to spend more time at home because it can develop a sense of resentment amongst children.
When children reach their adolescence, their thinking and preferences often change. Consequently, they and their parents fail to agree upon most things.  They may feel that their guardians are old-fashioned and do not share any common interest with them. As a result, they find it boring to spend time with them  and instead choose to hang out with their friends because they may share various common likes. Additionally, a few young people reside in hostels with their friends while studying in universities away from their parents, and sometimes, they may become used to spending all the time with their roommates. As a result, they do not give much preference to be at home.
If children are enforced to spend more time at home, this practice can create bitterness in their minds against their parents.  This is because many young people do not like to be controlled and forced to listen to edifications by their elders. If they are restrained, it may result in them becoming ill- mannered. For example, studies have shown that children who are grounded by their parents are more likely to show unpredictable / aggressive behaviour. However, parents can engage themselves in some kind of activities that their children like such as watching their favourite TV shows with them to motivate them to spend time at home.
In conclusion, many young adults choose to spend less time with their families because of age difference and uncommon preferences / interests.

1245,Nowadays culture is much the same all around the world when compared to previous times. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?,"Globalization has a huge impact on cultures worldwide. It has been observed that now there are identical cultures across the globe in contrast to earlier times. In my opinion, this is a positive development as it helps people to get connected and build their understanding about other customs.
Admittedly, nowadays cultures and customs are similar internationally in comparison to previous times when these things were completely opposite and less known. In older days people did not use to travel much and had limited knowledge about other culture) especially about foreign cultures. Owing to globalization, indigenous values and customs started spreading globally and it / this helped people to understand and appreciate other cultures. For instance, owing to the establishment of a plethora of foreign companies in India, most of the companies have also started celebration of festivals such as Diwali and Holi along with festivals such as Thanks Giving Day and New Year. This teaches people to appreciate other cultures.
Moreover, the merging of cultures of the nations worldwide gives people an opportunity to perform their rituals and still find acceptance among natives and non-natives. For instance, when I was in Dubai, I witnessed many Indians there celebrating Holi and the state government encouraged this. I also noticed that many natives also participate in such festivities.
In conclusion, because of the growing trade and commerce between countries, we see the merging of cultures everywhere today. In my opinion, this is a positive development because it helps people feel at home everywhere.

1246,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Both men and women have started equally working in every nation, and hence it is natural that they should divide their household chores among themselves. I agree with this viewpoint as this way of life provides several advantages such as a stress-free life and courage to be independent.
To begin with, sharing home chores mainly reduces the work pressure of the couple. Sharing domestic chores reduces the pressure on couples. If one of them has to do all the work alone after office hours, they will be under tremendous pressure. Eventually, the person who does all the domestic work will have no option but quit their job. This will make them miss out on their career and create feelings of resentment. By contrast, sharing household work enables both spouses to have a flourishing career and stress free family life.
Sharing household chores also enables both men and women to be independent. This is because both of them learn to do each and every job at home, and can run the house independently when one of them is out of town. For example, many software professionals benefit from this phenomenon because their job requires them to travel abroad frequently leaving their family.
In conclusion, working couples should share their household chores because it will help them reduce the workload and in turn, the stress. Furthermore, it enables them to be independent when they are all alone. Every working couple should be encouraged to adopt this lifestyle for leading a relaxed life.",7,should-working-men-and-women-share-household-works-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1247,Some people say there is no need for print newspapers. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the increasing popularity of new age / electronic media, traditional newspapers seem less appealing and unnecessary to many people. I believe that this trend is inevitable; however, it does not mean that print media has become redundant.
As technology has developed at an astounding pace, a considerable number of people have gadgets, such as mobile phones and the computers, which allow them to find information at any time, so fewer people read print newspapers today. If they want to check what is happening around the world, what they need to do is to just press some buttons on their screen. This way of accessing news has many advantages over reading print newspapers in terms of time efficiency and convenience, and that is why most modern people are no longer big fans of print newspapers.
Another reason why print newspapers are no longer needed is that their presentation of information is monotonous while the various functions of the digital news are more engaging and personalized. The discussion board of news online provides viewers with opportunities to exchange their ideas about how they perceive the news events; with notifications of digital news, subscribers can be well informed of the most updated information, so they will not miss any important news reports. All these features cannot be found in print newspapers because they just display information with texts and photographs.
On the other hand, reading newspapers in a traditional way may be preferred by some people, as print newspapers are more authoritative in terms of the authenticity of information. To publish an issue of newspaper, it involves a series of processes such as journalists collecting information on spot and editors proofreading reports multiple times. These vigorous steps greatly ensure the reliability of news. By contrast, much of online news is not true because each internet user is able to publish news and make it go it go viral. Readers of this kind of fault information will be misled.
In conclusion, print newspapers are still needed because of their inherent merits that online media lack. They are a reliable source of news and information. They may lack the versatility of online media but that does not mean that they are not needed.

1248,Some people think that it would be better for large companies and industries to move to regional areas outside large urban centers. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is often thought by some that large companies and industries will benefit more if they move from urban centers to rural areas. In my opinion, the advantages that the companies and the public receive from this outweigh any disadvantages.
The primary benefit for companies shifting from highly populated city centers to less populated rural areas is that they get enough space for the disposal of their waste. By doing so, air, water and noise pollution caused by large scale industries can be reduced. Also, industrial wastes can be properly disposed of without disturbing the environmental equilibrium. In addition, with the development of factories and other enterprises in remote areas, local people get a plethora of job opportunities which eventually lead to poverty eradication. A recent study by the University of Mumbai found that 80% of employers in the countryside prefer employees from the local areas and this has made a drastic change in rural people’s living standards over the last four years.
Admittedly, there are some disadvantages to companies moving from city centers to suburbs. As transportation facilities and availability of resources and raw materials are less in these regional areas, production may be affected at some stages. Obviously, this paves the way for loss of revenue during the initial stages. Furthermore, the consumer base may not be as large as that in cities and towns which may even cause economic crisis to some industries at certain stages of development.
In conclusion, industries and companies in rural areas help entrepreneurs to flourish their business without threatening the environment. This would also benefit many people with employment opportunities. Hence, I think minor loss of revenue during the initial phase of shifting to regional areas is not significant when compared with the advantages.",7,some-people-think-that-it-would-be-better-for-large-companies-and-industries-to-move-to-regional-areas-outside-urban-centers-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1249,"Some people feel that exploration of space justifies a large amount of government and private investment. Other people think that this field is of increasingly low relevance, and should not be a priority. Debate both sides of the discussion, and explain your own view. How important is it for us to explore space at the moment?","Governments and private organizations across the world are continuing to invest a lot of money in space exploration; however, many people disagree with this. There are valid arguments on both sides, which we will discuss now.
On the one hand, people who oppose space travel point out that it is better to utilize that funding for solving more pressing issues on earth, such as poverty and over-population which are threatening the very existence of mankind. Opponents also argue that space pollution is causing a negative effect on the environment.  They point out examples of recent shuttle launch, which burnt tons of fuel and left a lot of debris in the outer atmosphere resulting in a lot of space junk.
On the other hand, proponents argue that space exploration is a must because it gives mankind a chance to survive in case of a catastrophic event. Furthermore, they point out that relocating to another planet or solar system can only be possible through space travel. Supporters also point out the discoveries made in recent times and the advancements in the field of science and technology which were achieved by the International space station.
Overall, it appears that governments and private organizations should continue to fund space exploration since it has numerous benefits such as promoting technological advancements, improving living standards on earth and increasing the survival chances of humans in the event of a major natural catastrophe that makes our planet inhabitable. However, there is no justification for funding space programmes at the expense of other social welfare schemes.",7,some-people-believe-that-exploration-of-space-justifies-a-large-amount-of-government-and-private-investment-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1250,Many Children are encouraged by their parents to get a part time job in their free time. What are the advantages and disadvantages to children of doing so?,"Encouraging children to do part time job during their leisure time is becoming nowadays. Even though it helps to develop the habit of hardworking and confidence in children, it has some drawbacks as well.
Firstly, part time jobs will help the children to understand and experience the      difficulties and hardships parents face during their everyday day life to raise them.      This will surely enable them to appreciate the hard work of their parents and children will try to          share some of the responsibilities. They will understand the need for sharing and      caring. Working in a team will help children understand the             importance of interdependence and accepting the peers. A part time job also gives them a taste of their future life and will help them to organise their life in a disciplined manner and teach them how to balance personal life and work
On the other hand, non availability of free time will affect the mental and physical            development of children. They will be forced to go to work after school hours and the         valuable time they get to play and remould their fine motor skills will be reduced. The chance to earn money at a young age will also result in social and moral issues among          children. Since they don’t know how to manage the financial matters, they will utilize it for anti social activities such as smoking, alcohol consumption. The part time job will      also reduce their opportunities to interact with their peers of same age.
In conclusion, even though a part time job is beneficial for nurturing in children qualities like             interdependence, self confidence and courage to face real life situations, it may affect the mental and physical development of children. The knowledge and enthusiasm they get while reading stories and interacting with peers should not be compromised for other things.",7,many-children-are-encouraged-by-their-parents-to-get-a-part-time-job-in-their-free-time-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1251,People sleep less than before in many countries. Why people sleep less? What effect does it have individually and in society?,"It has been observed that people are getting less sleep in most of the countries. Busy lifestyle and career opportunities are a few factors responsible for this. Owing to such a lifestyle, a plethora of negative impacts have been observed on individuals and the society.
Firstly, people are taking less rest due to their hectic lifestyle. In most of the places, people travel long distances to work. Most of their time is consumed in travelling and due to incessant increase in traffic every single day, it gets difficult for an individual to reach home on time. Secondly, people devote extra time to their office for their career growth and to get promotions. These expectations encourage them to take more work and create a competitive environment. As a result, they do not get enough time for themselves to relax.
Moreover, monetary benefits are one of the preponderant factors. Many workers increase their working hours to get paid more so that they can afford the things which would otherwise be unable for them to afford. For instance, there are myriad of jobs which are based on incentives. The more business an employee brings for his company, the more incentives he gets. Owing to such benefits, people start working till late hours and take less rest.
However, working late hours and not getting adequate sleep will have detrimental effects on an individual’s health. People who have office jobs and who work late hours on computers are affected with vision problems, and it has also been found that most of such professionals are diagnosed with adiposity. Another major effect which has been noticed due to inadequate sleep is the behavioural issues in an individual. People get short-tempered and there have been many instances where people found themselves in confrontation with others over minor issues.
In conclusion, due to many factors such as the longing for professional growth and to receive higher wages, people are taking less rest in most of the countries. Consequently, they develop many health problems which have a negative impact on their performance and general disposition.",7,people-sleep-less-than-before-in-many-countries-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1252,An increasing number of people are now using dating sites to meet their better halves. Do you think that this tendency helps people to socialize or does more harm than good? Give your opinion. Provide relevant examples if necessary.,"In this era of technology, several mobile and internet applications have become popular among the people. As a result, a major share of the population is exploring various websites to find their soul mates. In my opinion, this trend is largely positive provided that users exercise caution.
Obviously, such websites act as a channel of communication for interested parties. To elaborate, people can have various sort of communication such as text messages, voice calls and video interactions; therefore these platforms make geographical and cultural barriers irrelevant. Tinder, one of the most popular online social websites, enshrines these features, and serves as a channel for finding potential partners and bonding with them. Therefore, it is an undeniable fact that the versatility of such cyber platforms is noteworthy.
To continue, these sites allow people to share their preferences and fantasies with others, which cannot be expressed publicly. Therefore, people can effortlessly search for partners who share their interests. For example, even though homo-sexuality is   legalized in many nations, it is difficult for homosexual people to find suitable partners using conventional channels. It is possible through these sites. Hence, the opportunity to express personal preferences makes these platforms popular with people.
In conclusion, although dating sites have features that make them prone to misuse, they are still popular among people because of their intrinsic features which enable a user to express their intimate feelings without having to worry about getting judged. In my opinion, these apps are beneficial as long as users use commonsense and do not trust anyone blindly.",7,an-increasing-number-of-people-are-now-using-dating-sites-to-meet-their-better-halves-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1253,Solar energy is becoming more and more popular as a source of household energy in many countries around the world. Why is this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, the use of solar energy has increased at an impressive rate. For many people, it is better to use solar energy than any other form of energy source. However, there are both pros and cons to deciding to do so.  In this essay, I will discuss some of the reasons for the widespread use of solar energy and some of the challenges to be overcome.
The obvious reason for the large scale utilization of solar energy is its advantages such as eco friendly properties, cost efficiency and ease of production. Solar energy does not cause environmental pollution unlike fossil fuel energy, which is the main source of emission of dangerous gases such as Co2 causing global warming and climatic changes. In addition, no extra payment is required once the solar system is installed. So it is cheap to produce and utilize. For instance, the fossil fuel production and distribution requires highly expensive machines and massive manpower.
Turning to the other side, due to the modernization of all house hold equipments and introduction of new kitchen appliances, the consumption of energy has increased compared to olden times. Since the solar energy depends on the availability of sunlight, the production rate is not sufficient enough to meet the entire needs of a house. The availability of sunlight is not uniform throughout the year in all parts of the world. For example, in Canada the availability of sunlight is less. Generally speaking, solar is not a viable energy source in cold countries that receive sunlight for only a few hours a  day.
All things considered, in comparison with other sources of energy, solar energy is clean, cheap and easy to produce provided that sufficient amount of sunlight is available. Personally I believe benefits of solar power eventually outweigh the negatives.

1265,Overpopulation of urban areas has led to numerous problems. Identify one or two serious ones and suggest ways that governments and individuals can tackle these problems.,"These days, more and more people tend to move from smaller towns or villages to big cities, thereby raising the population in urban areas. Overpopulation of urban areas has led to many problems. This essay will highlight some serious issues and subsequently suggest a few solutions to overcome these.
There are many issues caused by overpopulation. Firstly, it creates traffic congestion due to the increasing number of vehicles on roads. As a result, there are more road accidents and subsequently, more air population. For instance, according to a recent article published by the Times of India, there is a 20% rise in air pollution in Delhi.
The influx of migrants from other parts of the country has also increased the cost of living in urban areas because of the increased demand for housing and other facilities. For middle class families, it is becoming difficult to survive. Thus, the growing traffic and the rising cost of living are posing a challenge for individuals as well as government.
To overcome the aforementioned issues, firstly, municipalities must focus on new infrastructure, such as widening of roads, or constructing new flyovers. It will certainly be helpful to reduce traffic to some extent. Secondly, there is an immediate need for more houses. The local government should seriously expand the housing facilities in cities to accommodate more families. Definitely, these suggestions can support to reduce congestion and living cost. To sup up, overpopulation is a major cause of concern in urban areas.  There is an immediate need to control traffic congestion by building better infrastructure. It is also important to build affordable housing.",7,overpopulation-of-urban-areas-has-led-to-numerous-problems-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1266,"Children have more and more tests and exams at school, sometimes starting from the age of five or six right up until the age of 18. What are the advantages and disadvantages of making children do exams?","An examination is the primary way to gauge the ability of a student in modern day society and primary and secondary schools are highly reliant on this approach. While exams help to build competitive spirit in the students and assess themselves, it can sometimes be stressful, which can lead to different health-related issues.
Students can develop a sense of competition by writing exams. When a test is conducted, results are given at the end and these results help them understand their position in the class. If they are in the bottom half, they tend to improve to achieve higher marks. As per the study, surprise tests in primary schools are proven to be the best method to motivate children to perform better in the annual examination. Besides, it helps students prepare for life outside of school. As a society today is full of competition, these methods can help them face life with more confidence.
However, this approach may create pressure on the brain and depression among students. If slow learners are not able to score well in the test, then it will pressurize them to perform well, causing stress on their brain activity. Moreover, this method of evaluation may lead to a depression state. For instance, a student in Delhi, who scored fewer marks in 10 board exam tried to commit suicide due to constant pressure from his parents to score high grades, which he was not able to. Also, sometimes this method of evaluation may be unfair. A student may be good in expressing his thought on paper and others may not be the same.
To conclude, although it helps us prepare for life and improve our fighting spirit, there several adverse effects such as health hazards associated with it.",7,what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-making-children-do-exams-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1267,"Although more and more people read news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the present world, it is seen that a large number of people depend on the internet for most of their needs. There is no doubt that people prefer the internet to newspaper for news updates. However, in my opinion, although the readership of newspapers is declining gradually, they have their own place in the news industry.
Newspapers are considered to be the most important source of news and information for several reasons. The era of newspapers began long ago, much before the emergence of the internet and it will not come to an end anytime soon.
The old generation people and even many youngsters still rely on newspapers because they are used to reading newspapers from their very young age and it has become their habit. People cannot give up and old habit all of a sudden. And also not all people are comfortable with the latest technologies. Moreover, there are still many people who are not familiar with phones and computers and there are also places where the internet facility is not at all present. Better still, newspapers do not cause any eye strain. Consequently, people can read them for long hours. Another factor that works in favour of newspapers is their credibility. It is hard to ensure the veracity of information found online. However, in the case of newspapers, people can trust the source.
To conclude, although technology is developing fast, it cannot completely replace the traditional ways of accessing news and information. Online sources may continue to grow in popularity, but in my opinion, newspapers are here to stay because in addition to being a good source of news, newspapers inculcate the habit of reading in people.",7,although-more-and-more-people-read-news-on-the-internet-newspapers-will-remain-the-most-important-source-of-news-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1268,Most  people prefer  ready to eat food than home-made food now. Do you think it has more advantages or more disadvantages.,"The number of people eating fast food has been increasing since the last decade. The health problems associated with its consumption and increased financial spending outweigh the nominal benefits provided by it.
The only benefit of ready to eat food is that it is convenient. These days in many families both the husband and the wife work and they do not have time to cook proper meals. Consequently, they opt for fast food which they can buy from a store and eat without having to spend hours for cooking. Also, fast food may taste better because of artificial flavours and additives added to them. This is what attracts children to packaged foods.
On the flip side, in spite of the minor advantages mentioned above, there are potentially dangerous drawbacks associated with fast food. One of the major issues is obesity. This is because sandwiches, burgers or pizzas contain very high amount of calories. This exceeds the daily dietary requirement of most people, and as a result they suffer from obesity and related diseases. In addition, convenience foods rarely provide adequate nutrition. Consequently, children who consume them regularly fail to develop normally. Another issue associated with the consumption of fast food is that they are expensive. They can hurt the budget of middle and low income families.
In conclusion, the trend of people eating ready to eat food is associated with more drawbacks than benefits. It is hoped that people will realise the goodness of home-made meals and go back to them.",7,most-people-prefer-to-eat-ready-to-eat-food-than-home-made-food-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1269,"Many working people get little or no exercise either during the working day or in their free time, and have health problems as a result.
Why do so many working people not get enough exercise? What can be done about this problem?","Many health problems are on the rise among working people due to lack of any exercise in their day to day life. There are various reasons for the sedentary lifestyle which can be mitigated by creating awareness and building sufficient infrastructure.
There are many factors, which contribute to the lack of exercise in a working adult’s life. Firstly, people have become very lethargic in their day to day life. This could be due to the long commute which consumes much of their energy. Secondly, with the advancement of technology adults are choosing the internet and TV as their source of amusement. Playing, for instance, is no longer considered as a form of entertainment. Thus the popularity of digital forms of entertainment has led to less exercise and more couch time. Finally, the infrastructure available for exercising has not improved much in most parts of the world. Particularly in developing and under developed countries, lack of access to gym facilities has contributed to the inactive lifestyle.
Creating awareness among people about the benefit of exercise will encourage them to include workouts in their daily life. In addition, the government should enforce strict laws that ensure proper work-life balance. Companies that require their employees to work beyond regular working hours should be penalized or made to pay overtime.
Building more public gyms will provide the nudge that most working people need to be more active.
To conclude, the busy lifestyle and lack of access to gym facilities are the main reasons that prevent working people from getting physically active. In order to solve this problem, it is important to create awareness among people about the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle.",7,many-working-people-get-little-or-no-exercise-either-during-the-working-day-or-in-their-free-time-band-7-ielts-essay-sample-2
1270,Some people believe that young people bring more profits to a company. Others say that older people actually bring more profits. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays it is essential to have the right mix of both youngsters and seniors within an organization. According to some people, young workers make a greater contribution to the bottom line of the company; however, others insist that seniors contribute more. In my opinion, both of them are crucial for the success of a company.
In this fast-paced business environment many companies are investing heavily on young professionals. One of the pivotal reasons for this phenomenon is that an organization needs fresh ideas and innovations to have a dominant position in the market. Another reason for recruiting more young people could be the latest technology deployed across the departments. Young people are better than seniors at using technology. For instance, according to data released by CII in the year 2018, the most profitable and innovative companies in India also have the youngest percentage of young people working for them. In other words, to drive innovation and profitability, an organisation needs a younger workforce.
On the other hand, the contribution of old and experienced employees cannot be ignored. This is because their experience and exposure to different business situations make them better at handling stressful situations. In addition to that, experienced employees can make calculated moves and invest in avenues that will give steady and sustainable profits. For example, as per CII the companies which have showed balanced growth over the last 5 years are the ones having the most experienced staff.
To recapitulate, a company needs both young and mature employees to retain their competitive advantage and stay profitable. While youngsters can bring in innovation, seniors know how to steer the organization during bad times.",7,some-people-believe-that-young-people-bring-more-profits-to-a-company-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1271,It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children?,"During childhood, kids must learn about right and wrong. One way of making them know the difference is to punish them when they do something wrong. In my opinion, I agree that punishments go a long way in shaping a child’s future and keep them in the right path.
The fear of punishment will encourage students to stay away from wrongdoings and hence they will not get into any problems with their friends or teachers. This will make their school life free of issues and confrontations which will eventually make them perform well in school. For example, a kid punished for stealing a pencil from his classmate is unlikely to do that in future because of the embarrassment he faced the last time he did it. When these children grow up into adults they will always strive to do the right thing and they will stay away from the wrong path due to the lessons learned in their childhood. Admittedly, this will make them impart their values to their children also.  On the whole, the society will benefit from people like these.
Punishments do not necessarily have to be severe. For example, parents can cancel an outing or refuse to buy a birthday gift for their child. Teachers can give impositions or ask the kid to sit in the class during a physical training period.
In conclusion, children ought to know what is right and what is wrong. Parents and teachers can punish them in order for the children to correct their behaviour. This would build a better society of people who do only right things.",7,it-is-important-for-children-to-learn-the-difference-between-right-and-wrong-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1272,"Students are becoming more and more reliant on computers. What are some of the problems associated with reliance on computers, and what are some of the possible solutions?","With the advancement of technology, use of computers has increased dramatically. Students in particular have become overly dependent on computers. Although computers make learning easier, they cause problems such as plagiarism or distraction. This essay will discuss the problems associated with over dependence on computers and also suggest some solutions.
The main problem with the use of computers among students is that they easily get distracted from studies. When students study on computers they have easy access to the internet. As a result, they may lose focus and start surfing various websites. Ultimately, this will lead to the loss of precious study time. Consequently, they search for online solutions for their study problems or even outsource their homework by paying a fee. For example, according to a popular survey conducted by Times of India, there was a significant drop in the grades / marks obtained by students after the introduction of computers in the classrooms.
However, there are solutions to this problem. One of the solutions to the problems discussed above is to block irrelevant websites from students’ computers. If useless websites are blocked on students’ computers they won’t be distracted and they won’t be able to copy their homework from the Internet. Another possible solution could be the use of plagiarism detection software. When this software is installed, students will not search for solutions online as they know that they will be caught by the software. For example, many universities use plagiarism detection software to check whether assignments submitted by students are genuine or not.
In conclusion, there are some problems associated with reliance of students on computers. Students could lose focus on studies or they may copy homework from the internet. However, these problems can be solved by installing plagiarism detection software and by blocking unwanted websites.",7,students-are-becoming-more-and-more-reliant-on-computers-band-ielts-essay-sample
1273,"In many developing countries, there is a problem with declining quality of air and water from both industry and construction. What measures could be taken to prevent this?","The contamination of air and water caused predominantly by industries and construction activities is a big problem faced by developing countries. The government can take certain measures to reduce air and water pollution. For example, it can have a regulatory board which monitors the activities of factories and construction companies to ensure that they meet emission standards. The government should also enact laws that move industries to peripheral areas of the city. This essay will discuss these measures in detail.
Industrial emission can be kept in check/ control by having regulatory bodies which periodically examine the waste they produce and issue certificates. This certificate should be valid for only a few months and on its expiry, the board should perform the quality checks again If the factory does not renew the certificate, their license to operate should be cancelled. Another measure is to have all the industries outside city limits so that the pollutants do not affect the people.
Similar regulatory board can be formed for construction business as well. Since construction can happen anywhere in the city, this board should make sure that the air pollutants like cement and sand do not spread around. They can also check if the construction company has measures in place to treat waste water so that it does not pollute sources of drinking water.
In conclusion, the widely faced problem of air and water pollution in several developing countries can be reduced by appointing regulatory boards. These boards should enforce strict rules for industries and construction to ensure that they conform to standards pertaining to air and water pollutants. In addition, the government should move industries to areas outside the city.",7,in-many-developing-countries-there-is-a-problem-with-declining-quality-of-air-and-water-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1274,Many management interviews are based around assessing not only a person’s level of experience and knowledge but also their personality. Is leadership an innate skill? What other characteristics do companies look for in a manager?,"Recruiters consider the applicant’s personality while selecting them for managerial roles. Leadership, good communication skills, empathy and good manners are a few important characteristics that companies expect from a manager. In my opinion, leadership is an acquired skill due to the reasons outlined below.
Nobody is born with the skill or talent to lead a group of people or a community. Experience from our lives helps us to learn and become a good leader. Taking initiatives and helping the group in various tasks and becoming a role model for them is possible only through repetitive practice. It is rare for a newbie to be successful in the first few attempts. For instance, Mahatma Gandhi was a remarkable leader and from his autobiography we can see that it was through his life experiences and practice that he learned the skills required to be a good leader. Therefore, I believe that leadership is not an inborn skill but an acquired one.
Along with leadership quality some other factors are also considered while selecting a good manager. These are good communication skills, empathetic nature and good manners. Firstly, good communication is extremely important for a leader as he needs to communicate effectively within his group as well as to the customers. In addition, empathy is an equally important characteristic for a manager because only then his subordinates or customers will feel free to express their feelings to him. Finally, the ability to maintain one’s cool even during tough times makes one an ideal choice for a manager.
For instance, managers may have to deal with tough clients and during such situations it is necessary for them to be calm and good mannered to cope with the situation and resolve it. Therefore, apart from leadership quality, all the other characteristics mentioned above are extremely important for a good manager. In conclusion, leadership is not an inherent skill but an acquired or learned one. Managers who possess leadership quality, communication skills, empathy and good manners will do utmost justice to their roles.",7,is-leadership-an-innate-skill-what-characteristics-do-companies-look-for-in-a-manager-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1275,"In many developing countries, there is a problem with declining quality of air and water from both industry and construction. What measures could be taken to prevent this?","Air and water pollution caused by industrial and construction activities have become a major concern in many countries around the world. Although this is a serious issue, several measures can be taken to mitigate it.
Firstly, governments can bring in regulations to curb industrial and construction activity near water bodies. Industries working near water bodies emit toxic solid and liquid by-products to nearby water bodies and thus pollute them. For example, there has been improvement in the water quality of an Indian state after the state government imposed a rule that restricted / banned industries within 5km radius of rivers. Similarly, construction near water bodies also pollutes water. Therefore, the government’s resolve to impose such regulations certainly helps to mitigate the issue.
Several measures can be taken to improve the air quality as well. Decrease in air quality caused by the construction sites can be improved to a great extent by building different modules at the factories themselves. Therefore, only assembling of different such modules is required at the construction site which will surely reduce air pollution. Finding innovative methods of production that do not emit a lot of poisonous gases is another way to enhance air quality. Thus with the help of these above mentioned measures, we can reduce the air pollution issue to a great extent.
In conclusion, there is no denying the fact that construction and industrial activities cause air and water pollution. However, by enforcing stringent laws that ban industries near water bodies and urban areas and by adopting eco-friendly construction methods, this problem can be solved to a great extent.",7,declining-quality-of-air-and-water-is-a-growing-problem-in-developing-countries-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1276,Artists need a certain amount of freedom to develop their creativity. Artist should have total freedom to express any thoughts and ideas. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is true that in order to create something new, a certain level of liberty / freedom is required. Some people argue that artists should have absolute freedom to write, speak, act and create. While I admit that new inventions or innovations require some sort of freedom, I would also argue that absolute free-will can hurt the emotions of others.
To commence with, there are numerous reasons why liberty is crucial to develop something which has not existed before. Firstly, the tendency of the human mind is that it can broaden the realms of consciousness if it is not restricted. Since humans are rational thinkers, they can present their unique pieces of art like paintings, stories, and songs not only to entertain people but also to deliver a humanitarian message to individuals. For example, great writers and artists like Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci and A R Rehman would not be able to produce great works, if they did not have artistic freedom. They were able to create such things and reach heights because of the autonomy and the independence of thoughts. Today, people all across the globe enjoy their artistic creations.
In spite of the aforementioned arguments, I would argue that the sheer freedom to express personal feelings or ideas can hurt the sentiments of other people. The world consists of people of different backgrounds, religions, and everyone has different perceptions and beliefs. For example, a caricature a God or Goddess of one religion can create resentment among people of that particular faith and lead to a chaotic situation in the society. Therefore, the government should limit their freedom. Besides, the lyricists and the musicians have a significant impact on people, especially youngsters. If they write obscene lyrics and sing vulgar songs, it would instigate the youth to indulge in vulgar acts. Therefore, artists should keep the influence of their content on young-blood in mind before presenting their ideas to the world.
To recapitulate, independence is vital for expressing thoughts. However, I believe that it is also important to apply some restrictions on creative liberty because artistic freedom cannot be at the expense of the values and sentiments of the society.",7,artists-should-have-total-freedom-to-express-their-thoughts-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1277,Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?,"Thanks to the invention of newer communication technologies we can now interact with just about anyone with perfect ease. Of course, technology has had both positive and negative impact on our interactions and relationships, but in my opinion, the overall impact is largely positive.
The spectrum of modern innovative means of interactions such as Facebook, Twitter, email, and the mobile phones allows us to connect to people instantly. We are in position to talk to a relative, to order a transaction or submit an application from the comfort of our home. The benefits of such interactions are enormous. First of all they save time. Secondly, at a time of need or emergency valuable help is at our doorstep. More importantly, we have access to more information to facilitate a transaction by the possibility of contacting a source or side. All of these are beneficial for us.
However, there are negative aspects to this type of communication. Most importantly, this media may allow us to relate to people whose backgrounds are unknown to us. Most importantly, new age media enables us to connect with people whose backgrounds are unknown to us. It is important to understand that many people assume fake identities online. Another impact of such interactions is that we get isolated from the society. We may have numerous online friends and we are busy connecting with them, but we forget our immediate friends and neighbours.
Despite the drawbacks, today our lives are so enmeshed in this communication that it is impossible to survive without these means of interactions. More importantly, we are in a position to weed out useless or harmful information if we want to.
To conclude / On balance, it is my opinion that the overall benefits and the advantages of these relationships we build in the cyber world are more positive than negative.",7,nowadays-the-way-many-people-interact-with-each-other-has-changed-because-of-technology-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1278,Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?,"The growing menace of pollution and traffic congestion on our motorways may be due to an increase in the number of vehicles. Some people believe that by increasing the price of fuel this menace can be tackled. In my opinion, this is a wrong assumption and does not address the core issue of pollution and traffic control. In my opinion, petrol being the lifeline of our economy is an essential commodity. By increasing the price of this commodity, we can only hurt the growth of our economy.
If fuel prices increase, everything from essential medicines to vegetables will become expensive. More importantly, many people may take advantage of this hike in petrol price to make a quick gain. Because of these reasons, I totally disagree with this measure.
Some other measures should be explored to combat this menace. The most important way of doing this is to promote the use of public transport in place of private and personal vehicles. To encourage people to use public transport, busy roads should be made accessible to only public transport during peak hours. This measure will force commuters to use public transport such as buses and trains.
But the authorities have the responsibility to build an efficient and reliable public transport network in place. This has been done in countries like Singapore with a high rate of success. Another measure also adopted in countries like Singapore is to increase the price of cars and other personal vehicles. This also encourages the use of public transport system in place of private cars. Some other measures too should be taken. For example, the motorways should be maintained properly, the use of railways should be encouraged and old and polluting cars should be removed from our roads. It is my belief that increasing fuel price solves no problem; rather it creates another set of problem. By exploring alternative ways of combating this issue, we may attain greater success.",7,increasing-the-price-of-petrol-is-the-best-way-to-solve-growing-traffic-and-pollution-problems-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1279,"Leisure is a growing industry. Nowadays, more of modern technology is used in entertainment, which may lead people to be less creative. Do you agree or disagree? State your view with examples.","The entertainment industry is increasingly becoming popular around the world and usage of new technology in this field has changed it a lot. I do not agree with the argument that the use of technology will reduce the creativity of the people. I will prove my stand with valid arguments in this essay.
First and foremost, people are becoming more creative by applying technology in a leisure industry like cinema. They can put their ideas and imagination in movies through different software and devices. To illustrate, the famous Hollywood movie “Avtar” depicts the creative thinking of the writer which cannot be executed without the use of new technology. Hence, application of new types of software, web designing, and graphics helps us to become more creative and execute our creative ideas more efficiently.
In addition to this, theme parks, kids game zones, and art galleries are using different tech-related equipment and devices to enhance the creative ability of the youth. There are various art galleries which conduct digital painting events for visitors to showcase and discover their creative talent. Kids zones are converting games and sports into a digitalized form which otherwise required rare and expensive equipment. These games can be played on a computer desktop to learn and enhance creativity among children which was not possible before. According to research conducted by Harvard university due to the availability of technologically innovative games in various parks, children are now familiar with a lot more games than in the past. So, it helps to increase the learning and creative ability of children.
In conclusion, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that application of technology in the leisure industry has enhanced the creativity and artistic ability among people around the world.",7,nowadays-more-of-modern-technology-is-used-in-entertainment-which-may-lead-people-to-be-less-creative-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1280,Many people believe that social networking sites (such as Facebook) have had a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extent do you agree?,"Almost everyone uses social networking sites like Facebook these days. Some people are convinced that social networking has significantly more negative than positive impact on our lives. I completely agree with this view.
First and foremost, social networking has led to an increase in incidents of crimes. It gives even complete strangers access to the personal details of a person such as their locality, place of work etc. This is because social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram etc. encourage the public to share their day to day activities with their friends on their network. Although it feels good to share the happenings in your life with your mates by doing so online users are making it easy for fraudsters to access their personal information. Additionally, criminals can launch cyber attacks on their victim.
Another point to consider is the decline in human interactions. To illustrate, because of the flexibility that social networking provides like communication via chat, video calling, conference calls etc. it brings laziness to individuals. As a result, they hesitate to meet people in person. Unfortunately, lack of face to face interactions hurts relationships and leads to social alienation.
To sum up, although it sounds exciting to be part of social media and to share our whereabouts with friends, colleagues etc, it brings more concerns that need to be handled very well. Otherwise, it could have a significant negative impact on an individual and the society.  I believe that one should be very much aware of the issues that social networking brings before starting to use it.",7,many-people-believe-that-social-networking-sites-such-as-facebook-have-a-huge-negative-impact-on-people-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1281,"Learning English at school is often seen as more important than learning local languages. If these are not taught, many are at risk of dying out. In your opinion, is it important for everyone to learn English? Should we try to ensure the survival of local languages and, if so, how?","In some countries teaching English at schools is becoming more important than teaching the local language. This may lead to the demise of some languages.
Putting English at a higher level of importance at schools than the mother language is a very bad idea. Firstly in this essay I will discuss when English should be taught at schools and then the need for using English on a daily basis in countries where English is not the mother language.
English should be studied when someone realizes that  it’ll be necessary for his or her career. Many people know no English until they are grown up, but they can study it and achieve a great level of proficiency after sometime. For example, in 2005 only 30% of the population between 30-40 years old in Brazil knew how to speak English well, but 10 years later, 65% of the population between 40-50 years old were very good English users.
Not everyone needs to know English to go through the day. many don’t use it during their routine. By this it’s clear that a local language is far more important, because that’s the one used in that specific place. Keeping it like this can save this particular language. A study done by USP about country cities in 2016 showed that only 10% of these city’s citizens need English regularly.
To conclude, thinking that English is more important than a local language is a risk that’s not worth taking. Learning English when you are older and out of school is a great way of keeping other languages alive. Letting people who don’t use English every day speak only their own natural language is more important than teaching English to them.",7,learning-english-at-school-is-often-seen-as-more-important-than-learning-local-languages-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1282,"Some people think that the only way to relax is to rest or sleep, while others say that people need to do exercise or sports to relax. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Nowadays people work around the clock; as a result, they become tired by the end of the day. Some people opine that taking rest and having a sound sleep is the best way to relax our body and mind. However, others believe that doing some workout and playing sports is a better way. I agree with the former view, and I will discuss both sides in the forthcoming paragraphs.
To begin with, a power nap is a better way to relax our body. Firstly, sleeping helps our body to rejuvenate our body cells. When a person is sleeping his body goes into the self-repair mode, and takes energy from the consumed food. Consequently, people feel fresh when they wake up.
Secondly, it is a well-known fact that the efficiency of a person increases when he takes naps to relax. For example, according to the World Health Organization, people who take regular sleep are more efficient and have better problem-solving skills than the people who work continuously. Thus, it is evident that power naps can enhance the capabilities of the individuals.
On the other hand, doing physical exercise for relaxation can increase the blood flow in the body which helps in reducing daily work-life stress. As a result, people will feel relaxed and free from all the tensions. Therefore, some people believe that it is a better way to relax. Yet, this is not something people can or want to do when they are tired after working in the office for long hours.
To conclude, although, doing physical work-out can be a stress-buster for humans, I believe that taking regular sleep is the best way to relax in the sense that it repairs body cells and nourishes our mind.",7,some-people-think-that-the-best-way-to-relax-is-to-rest-or-sleep-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1283,Fewer and fewer young people are choosing to become a teacher. Why do young people do not want to become teachers? How could this be changed?,"In ancient times, teachers were given the highest order and respect in the society. Hence there was considerable interest in becoming a teacher. However, things have changed in this modern world and fewer people want to pursue teaching as their career. There are multiple reasons for this.
Nowadays there are plenty of other higher paying jobs which can easily satisfy their needs. Also, many other jobs such as that of an engineer, scientist, doctor etc are considered to be more prestigious in the society. This essay will discuss why youngsters are reluctant to take up teaching as their profession. This essay will also suggest some ways to alter this mindset.
Although teaching is still considered as a passion by many, the majority of the youngsters avoid getting into this field and they have a valid reason for this. There is a huge disparity in the salaries of a teacher and a doctor or engineer. Other professionals are given more benefits such as life insurance, healthcare, free food etc. With better pay, they can easily manage their expenses but this is not the case with teachers – they are given hardly any benefit. Since this gap is easily visible to people, they tend to incline more towards other jobs. For instance, according to a survey conducted by the Human Resources Committee in India, teaching is amongst the lowest paid profession.
However, this scenario can be easily avoided. If teenagers are given proper counseling then they might think better and take the correct decision. Parents play a major role here. They should encourage their children to pursue anything which interests them. Children should be taught since their childhood that no job is insignificant / trivial. It is the mindset of the people which needs to change. For instance in Canada, the government is running campaigns wherein it encourages the younger ones to consider this job.",7,fewer-and-fewer-young-people-are-choosing-to-become-teachers-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1284,Men do most of the high-level jobs. Should the government encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be reserved for women? What is your opinion on that? Use your own knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.,"All over the world, high level positions are occupied by men. Some individuals opine that there should be a gender-based reservation for high profile jobs to give more opportunities to women. I entirely disagree with the view and have sufficient arguments to justify my stand.
There are apparent reasons why reservation for high-end posts is not considered as a good idea. Firstly, it will create a sense of discrimination in the employees. If a woman is promoted to a CEO level post on the basis of her gender in spite of lacking the skills, other capable and deserving candidates will lose their motivation, and workforce may get divided into two segments which would be lead by two different genders. This is to say that this will not only deprive the deserving candidates of opportunities but also make them demoralized.
Secondly, if women are given higher positions in the organization because of their gender and not skills, it can have detrimental impact on the performance of the organization. For example, The CEO of CloudTech Ltd. had got that position because of gender-based reservation in 2017. The company has recorded a decline of 50% in profits because of inappropriate policies and decision made by her due to the lack of capabilities and skills. Thus, it is evident that deserving candidates should be employed at the decision-making position; otherwise it can have adverse effects on the overall performance of the company.",7,should-the-government-reserve-a-certain-percentage-of-high-level-jobs-to-women-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1285,"In order to improve country’s education system, young students should be openly allowed to criticize their teachers during class time. Do you agree with this? What are other ways education systems could be improved?","The Education system has changed over the passage of time. Many people have the opinion that students should be able to criticize / should have the option to criticize their teachers in order to improve the education system. I completely disagree with this opinion because this will spoil the overall education system. I believe that the class strength should be reduced and quality training should be imparted for each student.
I believe that criticizing our teachers will disrupt the education system. Criticizing will be like insulting and disrespecting our teachers. This will hurt the student-teacher relationship; as a result, teachers will pay less attention and care for their students. In addition, the emotional bonding between the teachers and the students will become weak. Furthermore, students will not get that mental support and psychological guidance from their teachers. Therefore, it is very important that we give respect to our teachers.
In order to improve the education system, we should work on the strength of the classrooms and focus on the individual requirements of the students. If there are so many students in the class, the teacher will not be able to give adequate attention to each of them. For instance, the ideal class strength should be a maximum of twenty students per class but in India, we increase the batch size to over fifty students, in order to increase school revenue. Such systems should be completely abolished, as it impacts the overall performance of the students. Teachers will be able to focus on only a few students at a time; thus by reducing the strength of the class personal attention can be given for each student to better understand their weaknesses, thus such issues can be addressed very well by the teachers. This will improve the quality of our teaching.
In conclusion, criticism is not a solution for implementing a proper education system. Instead, we should reduce the class strength, so that individual attention can be given to the students, which will definitely improve the quality of our education system.",7,in-order-to-improve-the-education-system-young-students-should-be-openly-allowed-to-criticize-their-teachers-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1286,"Computers these days can translate all kinds of languages with greater accuracy. Hence, our children will not need to learn more languages in the future. Do you agree/disagree?","Technology has become so advanced that it can translate any language. Many people believe that because of technological support, it is no longer necessary to teach children any additional language. In my opinion, I completely disagree with the statement because over-dependence on computers affects our personal growth and also it leads to a communication gap.
Communication through technology will lead to lack of understanding among the people. The same word can have different meanings in different contexts. Likewise, different words can have the same meaning. Using a particular word in the right context requires some special skills which computer applications do not possess. For instance, club, band, association and group are all synonyms of society but not all of them can fit in one particular context; therefore there will be some lack of clarity when computers are used to translate. A language is an expression of a culture which only a human being can understand properly.
At the same time, over dependence on computers affects our personal growth. When we expose children to the technology to translate a language, then we become over dependent on computers. The result is that we fail to develop our intellectual abilities, which further hinders our ability to solve complex problems. Thus, the cognitive ability to perform a particular task tends to diminish. Furthermore, we will not have access to technology every time and everywhere. For example, in remote places we will not be able to make use of technology due to lack of support; therefore, in those cases, we need to develop our own learning skills in order to communicate with the locals.
In conclusion, over dependence on computers will spoil our intellectual development and also such technology can create communication gap among the people.",7,computers-can-translate-all-kinds-of-languages-hence-children-will-not-have-to-learn-languages-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1287,Most people think that truth should be objective rather than subjective when it comes to the news. Do you think all news is true? What is the function of a newspaper?,"It is considered by many people that the news media must be unbiased and report news as it is. In my opinion, much of the news which we receive is either biased or false. The role of a newspaper is to review and deliver the truth and keep the readers informed of it.
Although much of the news which is gathered by the media is fair, it is not always delivered to readers. In other words they exaggerate the news in order to draw the attention of readers. Sensationalised stories will make the public watch the news channels or read newspapers regularly. For instance, in the US, the news channels now portray only the negative aspects of their President. While it is true that Trump has his shortcomings as a person and an administration, it is wrong to assume that he is a total failure. Yet, that is the impression one gets when one reads American newspapers. This kind of reporting unfortunately does not benefit the country or its people. Overall, the media is subjective because their own concern is protecting their business interests and propagating their ideologies.
The primary function of a newspaper is to provide authentic information about various happenings around the world. When reported objectively, it is beneficial to the readers. For example, if the media is unbiased, and reports news as it is, it can help its readers vote the right government to power. Likewise, it can help people choose the right products and services for their needs. Another significant role of a newspaper is to accurately interpret and analyze the news. Most news papers have an editorial column which analyses a major news item. This column usually gives the opinion of the news editor or newspaper management. Presenting a fair analysis is vital because people newspaper editorials play a crucial role in shaping public opinion.
In conclusion, this essay discussed why media houses prefer subjective reporting and the downsides of this trend. It also narrated the role of a newspaper in delivering and interpreting news.

Should the news focus on good news instead?,"News enables us to stay updated about the latest happenings around us and that is why it is so important to people all over the world. This essay discusses why media houses give undue coverage to bad news and why it is important for them to shift their attention to good news.
News keeps everyone updated on what is going on nearby and across the world. Hence people follow the news closely in order to keep themselves up to date of the new intentions and matters. News has also become important these days as it keeps us alerted. People know the kind of crimes that are happening in their surrounding and this helps them exercise extreme caution.
These days many news channels aim to center their shows on bad news. This gives them multiple points to discuss which will increase their screen time on the TV. They have more content to debate and more material to air on their news channel. Sometimes these negative stories prove to be a source of entertainment to their audience. For example, there are many shows such as Crime Patrol which are meant to make the public cautious and safe. They became popular because of their thrilling plots high on action and suspense.
However, I believe good news should be broadcasted more as it brings the society closer. Good news cheers the mood of many people and makes them feel better. It also brings a lot of positivity to many sections of the society.
In conclusion, this essay discussed why news plays a pivotal role in people’s life.

1289,"Most countries want to improve the standard of living through economic development; however, others think the social value is lost as a result. Do you think the advantages of economic development outweigh the disadvantages?","While economic development has lifted many poor people out of poverty and brought the public a better materialistic lifestyle, many people contend that this trend cause the loss of traditional value. I do not quite agree with this view. I am of the view that this trend has more merits than demerits which are manageable to a great extent.
On the one hand, many benefits are brought because of economic growth. Firstly, it reduces poverty and improves the quality of life. While economy grows, more job opportunities are being generated. The income from jobs can help the society escape poverty and people can have a better standard of living. In addition, people can have access to education when they can afford the tuition fee. Through education, people gain a variety of knowledge in many fields, and learn how to use it for a better world.
On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that some traditional values are deteriorating because of the materialistic lifestyle brought on by economic development. For example, after meeting basic needs, people tend to pursue more luxurious items without cherishing the things they have already owned. Many children nowadays consider smart phone as a common stuff they should own. Additionally, with greater standards of living, humans think that everything can be bought with money, even friendship and love. When the society becomes like this, it is hard for us to trust others or build a true relationship. However, the social values can be restored / protected by imparting moral lessons from an early age. People can cultivate the correct moral values and stick to those principles even though the society may be changing.
To conclude, the society should develop the economy because it brings immense benefits, such as improved quality of life and chance to acquire education. As for the risk of losing social value it can be prevented by giving value education from an early age.",7,most-countries-want-to-improve-the-standard-of-living-through-economic-development-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1290,Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than Secondary School. Do the advantage of this outweigh disadvantage?,"In the era of globalisation, learning a foreign dialect provides numerous opportunities for students. According to some educationalists, children should be taught a non-native language like English from Elementary School instead of Higher Secondary. In my opinion, this has more benefits than drawbacks.
There are certainly a few drawbacks to learning a foreign language at primary school. The first and the most obvious one is that children are too young to understand the depth of other languages, notably, vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation. In other words, they are not intellectually mature enough to assimilate the richness of a foreign language. What is more, since students at this age do not even fully comprehend their mother tongue, emphasis on a foreign dialect may leave them in an awkward situation. Consequently, it puts some extra burden on them.
In spite of the points mentioned above, I still argue that learning a foreign language in the inception stage of schooling is advantageous. The primary reason is that youngsters have more grasping power than adults. As a result, what they learn at this age gets imprinted on their mind. As the children grows, this language learning ability diminishes. To elaborate, research conducted by a language learning institute in California on 1000 students of 5 to 12 age group found that at this age the mind is better equipped to acquire knowledge.
Additionally, learning a non-indigenous language is a time-consuming process. If students embark learning early, by the time they reach high school, they will become proficient in it. Secondly, when students study in Higher Secondary School, they do not have to put extra efforts to understand the foreign language. As a result, students can focus on their course subjects like physics, chemistry and mathematics. Hence, they will receive better academic results.
To recapitulate, it is apparent from the aforementioned arguments that the disadvantages of learning a foreign language at primary class are negligible when compared to the benefits it provides.",7,some-experts-believe-that-it-is-better-for-children-to-begin-learning-a-foreign-language-at-primary-school-band-7-ielts-essay-sample

According to them, other measures are required to ensure public health. I do admit that sports are beneficial for health, but in my opinion people also need to follow a healthy diet and a healthy lifestyle.
Beyond doubt, there are several benefits to indulging in sporting activities. Most of the outdoor and indoor sports require physical effort and this in turn makes a person active and flexible. This definitely helps to better the physical body. To illustrate, a person indulging in regular sports is bound to be fitter than a person who does not participate in any major physical activities or sports. In addition to that, playing a sport benefits the mental health and keeps a person agile and active in their thinking. Thus, we can see why some people are of the view that playing sports is the most ideal way to attain balanced health.
However, playing a sport alone is not sufficient. It is also important for people to watch their diet. If they follow a nutritious diet and play a sport regularly, they have very good chances of maintaining good health. For example, no matter how much sport we play it is not going to be that effective until we follow a proper diet and exercise regime. Exercise helps the body to gain the agility and lose extra calories and a balanced diet makes sure that the amount of supplements required to the body is supplied in an efficient way and the body does not put on the extra calories and fat. Therefore, it is clear why people consider measures like exercise and balanced diet more effective than merely playing sport to attain good health.

To conclude, people might vary in their opinion but I firmly advocate that playing a sport alone will not be that effective in improving the fitness level of a person. In addition to playing, people should exercise regularly and eat a balanced diet.",7,some-people-say-that-the-best-way-to-improve-public-health-is-by-increasing-the-number-of-sports-facilities-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1292,In some countries girls and boys are educated in different schools rather than the same school. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?,"In many nations across the world, boys and girls are sent to separate schools. This essay will discuss the advantages of this trend and then outline its drawbacks.
To start with, the main advantage of doing this is that there are minimal chances of sexual abuse. It makes one feel safe and secure when one is among children of one’s own gender. Another merit is that they do not have to deal with any kind of distraction which takes away their focus from their studies, unlike in mixed schools, where boys and girls get attracted to each other and lose focus on their studies. Also, it has been found that the success rate of single gender schools is higher than that of co-educational schools.
However, there are some demerits to sending children to the same gender schools. Firstly, it becomes very difficult for a child to interact with a person of opposite gender. Not only do they find it difficult to talk, but they also get a little conscious and confused about their behaviour at that moment. Secondly, this gives rise to gender discrimination. From a very young age, boys and girls get knowledge of the different kind of treatment they receive on the basis of their gender and this gives rise to much bigger issues in the society.
To conclude, although there are advantages to educating children in separate institutes based on their gender, it should not be forgotten that this arrangement does have some adverse ramifications. This may help with their academic grades, but it could hurt their social skills.",7,in-some-countries-boys-and-girls-are-educated-in-different-schools-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1293,"Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, while others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Since ancient times, schools have been considered as the temple of knowledge. Therefore, it is often argued by many people that much of the learning should happen in the school and the students should not be burdened with home assignments. However, there are many others who disagree with this view; they think that homework is a crucial part of their child’s overall education. In my opinion, young students should not be given any homework because they need time to play once they reach home. However, older students should be given homework because they have to revise their lessons every day to achieve good grades.
On the one hand, many parents feel that homework is an extra burden that has been put on their child’s shoulder. In their opinion, children should be taught everything in school so that they can play or rest when they reach home.  If students have no homework to complete, they can focus more on some sports which they could take up as a hobby or even as a career option. Or they can just play around with other kids and spend time with their families which would contribute to their overall personality development.
On the other hand, certain parents think that homework plays a vital role in the academics of their children. According to them, homework serves as a revision of the class work which helps the child to understand the topic better. It also gives them an additional practice of the lesson taught to them in the school. This, in fact, reduces the exam stress considerably as the student has practiced the lessons multiple times.
To sum up, it is said that too much of anything is bad; hence there should be a balance maintained in terms of homework given to a student. Schools should come up with a timetable which could allow students to focus more on studies in school so that they can focus on other activities after school.",7,some-people-believe-that-school-children-should-not-be-given-homework-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1294,Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school. Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and includes any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.,"Many people are of the opinion that parents are the best teachers and home schooling is the right approach; however, others insist that the school is the best place for their growth and development. In my view home schooling is more beneficial for the holistic development of children.
Children are like hot wax and need to be cast into the right shape. Since parents know them better than anybody else, they make the best teachers at least during the formative years of a child. To further exemplify, at home children will be safe from bad company and habits. Secondly, when children spend more time at home, they develop better moral values and family ties. Both factors benefit their holistic development. Also, when they are taught at home, they can learn at a time and pace convenient to home. In addition to that, they get the undivided attention of their parent or tutor and this enables them to learn their lessons faster.
On the other hand, at school, children are taught by well-trained teachers. Also, children attending school are better disciplined. At the school they learn skills such as team work and decision making which help them become successful adults in future. Nowadays most children are part of a nuclear family and find it difficult to adjust with others and become more self- centered; however, at school they need to be with the children of different thought processes and cultures which will help them to understand the need of other children around them. Hence, children going to school are better prepared for a challenging future.
To conclude, it is evident that for children’s development the skills taught at both home and the school are important, but I believe home training will be more personalized and caring.",7,some-people-believe-that-teaching-children-at-home-is-best-for-a-childs-development-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1295,"In many places, new homes are needed, but the only space available for building them is in the countryside. Some people believe it is more important to protect the countryside and not build new homes there. What is your opinion?","Although the demand for housing is increasing, there is no open space available for their construction except in the countryside. However, some people argue that the countryside should be protected from construction activity. I disagree with them. In my opinion, it is important to build homes on the outskirts of cities.
First and foremost, cities have become over crowded due to urbanization and free space is only available in the countryside. More and more people are migrating to cities for a better future and hence the space available for construction has already been used.
To meet this demand for land, people are turning to the countryside. Many customers also want to buy homes in the countryside because they are more affordable. Also, pollution is not really an issue in rural areas. Hence, people opting to live in the countryside can buy spacious homes built amidst natural greenery. In addition to this, if construction is done in the areas away from the city we can reduce the negative effects of urbanization. Due to overcrowding in cities, people face not only traffic congestion but also pollution. For example, in a South Indian city, a 40% improvement in air quality was observed after they started building homes in the peripheral areas of the city instead of in the centre. Thus, to improve the quality of life in the urban area it is a better solution.
However, there should be strict rules regarding the construction of homes in the countryside. Homes should be built with proper ventilation and there should be vegetation zones and free spaces between houses to prevent the bad impact of construction in those areas.
In conclusion, as population is continuously moving to cities for better prospects, there is a simultaneous increase in the demand for shelters. Therefore, the countryside can be utilised for this purpose and to curb the effects of overcrowding in cities.",7,new-homes-are-needed-but-the-only-space-available-is-in-the-countryside-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1296,Popular events like the football world Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential for easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in the safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"International sporting events are one of the best ways to resolve international disputes. I completely agree with the argument that these types of sporting events reduce tension between nations. We will first discuss how such events reduce international worries and then see whether these events are safe.
International sporting events help us to forget all our internal worries and grudges for some time. It is seen that while watching any sport, people get themselves completely involved in cheering their own countries and they completely enjoy this moment. Audience normally do not recall any internal tensions during this period; they express their patriotic emotions for their country and root for their team. Such feelings bring the entire nation together to cheer for their players to win and succeed.
Furthermore, the sports culture is very safe as because there are strict rules and regulations under which the games are performed; therefore the environment is highly safe for everyone. Unlike in wars, where there are destructions and losses in sports we freely participate to show our skills and love for our country without caring much about any personal losses, even though there are injuries but medical assistance is provided. Such type of occasions reduces internal disputes because people from all over the world participate to portray their best skills for winning for their country. It is a great pride and honour for everyone participating in such sporting events.
In conclusion, international sporting events reduce internal worries and disputes by bringing everyone together to cheer for their countries in a much safer environment.",7,popular-international-sporting-events-are-essential-for-easing-international-tensions-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1297,"Many working people get little or no exercise either during the working day or in their free time, and have health problems as a result. Why do many working people not get enough exercise? What can be done about this problem?","There is no doubt that working out daily is essential to stay fit and healthy. However, many working professionals are not able to set aside time for exercise from their busy schedule. Unfortunately, this affects their health.
To keep body and mind healthy physical activity is essential. Furthermore, body and muscle movement helps in better circulation of blood. For instance, people who do gym, yoga, jogging or any other kind of workout tend to perform better at the workplace due to activeness in the body. If they are not able to take time out from their work for exercise, then they may encounter health issues as they grow older.
For many people their work is their utmost priority. There could be many reasons as to why they don’t get enough exercise. One of the reasons is fatigue. Many people feel exhausted after spending a whole day at work.
Another reason could be lack of planning and inability to find a suitable time for work out. However, there are some simple solutions to this problem. For example, busy employees can do light exercises like stretching at the workplace itself or they can take frequent short breaks and go for a short walk.
In conclusion, despite heavy work load and other hindrances, working population should strive for a balance between work and workout. This will not only help them to achieve efficiency at the workplace, but also enhance their health.",7,many-working-people-get-little-or-no-exercise-either-during-the-working-day-or-in-their-free-time-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1298,"When designing a building, the most important factor is the intended use of the building rather than its outward appearance. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is advocated by some people that in the planning of any building, utility & functionality should be given prime importance rather than its external face. In my opinion, while the purpose for which the building is built scores more points, both the factors play a crucial role. Talking about appearances, while first impressions may not be the vital criterion for choosing a service, they definitely cannot be ignored.
The aesthetic appeal of magnificent structures constructed in many countries not only adds value to the assets, but it is also a delight for the tourists and many International Geographic channels. Dubai, for instance is well known for its majestic buildings with awe striking features like Burj Khalifa which is visited by travelers and has been featured on various television programmes.
However, while laying out a plan for any structure there are several factors which need to be considered. Firstly, the purpose for which the building is being constructed is the sole deciding factor for the rest of the other things. For example, an old age home will need to be safer and convenient for the geriatric patients. Therefore, there would be many slopes and railings all over for wheelchairs and comfortable navigation.
On the other hand, the requirement for a shopping mall may be entirely different and it should be more glamorous to capture the attention of public. Secondly, the budget required to construct the same would also determine if the building can be made fancier or if it should remain simple while serving the main use. Last but not least is the location and the kind of people around. For instance, in a small town in India, perhaps an outward look of any building may be the last concern of most people.
To summarize, I believe that while the functionality should be at the core of any structure, the external beauty cannot be completely ignored.",7,when-designing-a-building-the-most-important-factor-is-the-intended-use-of-the-building-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1299,Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"There is a popular saying that the child is the father of nation. The mould provided to them when they are young is what they are likely to become. While some people opine that cooperative children make better adults than competitive children, I cannot fully agree with this view. Competitiveness cannot be omitted entirely and I consider it necessary to some extent.
Unfortunately, it has been brought out by various studies that there is a lack of empathy in this fast paced millennium. Therefore, to overcome such a dreadful development, it has become mandatory now to instill the higher values such as a helping mentality, kindness and cooperation in our children. This would eventually help them to become better, compassionate adults and possibly enable/encourage them to serve the society for a greater cause. Moreover, cooperation is essential for the smooth functioning of our society. Furthermore, during a job interview, a candidate’s team spirit is assessed by making him go through certain group activities.
On the other hand, competitiveness acts as a propelling force which drives children to attain their goals as long as it is healthy. Enabling us to become a better version of ourselves at every step is one of the several pros of being competitive. Moreover, in this world of cutthroat competition, it is a necessary evil. For instance, in India, there are at least five hundred students competing for every single medical seat in a medical college. Without being competitive, it would be almost impossible to crack the exam. However, an excess of this quality may alter the personality and attitude of children in the long term. It may lead to unhealthy jealousy and features of type A personality making them more stressed out in due course. The need to win all the time may encourage them to adopt unethical practices like pulling others down by undue means.
To conclude, I reiterate that to shape our world into a better place, children must be conditioned to become more compassionate and cooperative. However, a healthy competitiveness should also be encouraged so that it keeps them motivated to do better. The holistic approach would be to instill both the qualities proportionately to shape a child into a wholesome individual.",7,some-people-think-that-a-sense-of-competition-should-be-encouraged-in-children-band-7-ielts-essay-sample

Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","While some people insist that parents are responsible for moulding young children into responsible adults, others opine that teachers have a greater responsibility to impart value education. In my opinion, schools have a greater role than parents in shaping the socio-cultural behaviour of children. This essay explains why parents are not the best people to impart social values.
Parents are the first teachers for any child. They are the first people the child comes into contact with and during early childhood, they are the only influence on the child. However, as the child grows up and starts school, they will have a variety of influenced on them at that stage, it is not easy or possible for parents to monitor their conduct strictly. Also now in most families both parents go out to work and it is very difficult for them to give complete attention to the social and moral development of their children.
Schools, on the other hand, teach students values such as discipline, punctuality, empathy and so on. Also schools help mould kids into better grownups by teaching them teamwork, and giving them opportunities to participate in various socio-cultural activities such as tree plantations, clean up drives etc. The other key aspect is that children spend a considerable amount of their day at school with their peers and so it is the most suited place to learn and perfect social values and good conduct. For example, in my secondary school, it was compulsory for everyone to to participate in community welfare programmes. A school alone can provide ample of opportunities for kids to to embrace these intangible values and practice them in their lives.
To sum up, parents undoubtedly are the first people who teach children values but the role school plays in nurturing kids with their holistic approach is definitely incredible. Hence, in my opinion, schools have a greater impact than parents on the social and moral development of children.",7,some-people-think-that-parents-should-teach-children-how-to-be-good-members-of-the-society-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1301,"With an increasing percentage of the population communicating via the internet and text messaging, face to face communication will become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree?","According to some people, the rise in the use of internet based communication tools and text messages will result in the demise of face to face communication. I strongly agree with this view. In my opinion, the latest forms of communication will eclipse traditional methods soon.
Internet based communication is becoming more and more popular because it is quick and reliable. Since internet networks are now available in all parts of the world, people can communicate with their friends, family and clients scattered across the world at any hour of the day. Also internet communication is possible in many different ways. For example, we can send an email or engage in a video chat. In other words, the latest system of communication has made life much easier with useful features like inexpensive video chatting with family and friends. For example, I use Skype every evening to chat with my parents in India.
Another benefit is that the instant communication tools of of the modern era eliminate the need to travel long distances to have an interaction or deliver a message. Thus, it can be considered economic too and highly suitable for business and education needs. As face to face interactions may require travelling and meeting at a certain place, they are a time consuming process, which is unsuitable for the requirement of the modern life where one needs to do more in less time. Hence, the age old face to face chat is now considered almost obsolete and is used limitedly. To exemplify, now a trader in a country can buy products from a vendor in another continent through a simple email without ever seeing each other’s face which makes their business transactions quicker and boosts their trades.
In conclusion, the use of modern technology has grown substantially leading to frequent use of video calls, emails, text messages and voice mails and minimised the time and effort required for in-person communication. This trend suggests that it will certainly replace face to face chat in near future.",7,face-to-face-communication-will-become-a-thing-of-past-because-of-internet-based-communication-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1302,Some people feel online courses are better while others feel classroom courses are good? Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"The advancement in technology has revolutionized each and every aspect of our life including the way we learn. For example, many educational institutes now offer online classes to aspirants sitting in different parts of the world. While some people favour this approach others prefer the traditional mode of learning. In my opinion, online classes are better than traditional classroom courses.
To begin with, there are many compelling reasons to believe that the internet has made it easy to pursue higher education. Primarily, online learning is beneficial for working professionals who cannot afford to attend a classroom course due to their jobs and hectic schedule. They can learn through online classes according to their convenience. Moreover, learning online provides them a chance to choose from a large variety of study material as well as it saves their time and money. For instance, one can get thousands of video lessons on any particular topic and select the one which gives proper study guidelines.
Classroom learning also has its advantages. It enables more effective interactions between the teacher and the student. If the student has a doubt, they can seek an immediate clarification from the teacher. This makes learning easier. However, classroom courses have their limitations too. For example, they tend to be more expensive than online courses. Also they have fixed hours which makes them unsuitable for working people. By contrast, anyone can join an online course and study at a time convenient to them.
On balance, online courses have many features that make them more suitable than classroom courses for most learners. Of course, online learning still has many downsides, but as technology develops, many of these problems will be resolved.",7,some-people-feel-that-online-courses-are-better
1303,Some people think that recruiting companies should aim to take on people who are innovative and able to work independently while others consider they should recruit people who are able to work in a team and follow instructions. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"According to some people companies should prefer innovative and independent workers when selecting employees. On the other hand, others think that team workers should be given preference instead of those who can work independently. In my opinion, a company needs both types of people for optimal growth.
Those, who are in favour of creative and independent workers, claim that such employees bring in new ideas and develop new technological products and apps. This leads to an increase in the sales as well as improve the reputation of the company. Since the advent of new age technologies, a brilliant idea can help a company make a fortune. Hence, innovative employees who can work without supervision are an asset for any organization.
However, some people believe that teamwork is the key to the success of a company. They hold the view that working together stimulates brainstorming. When people with different skills, point of views and experiences work together, they can create great innovations. Teamwork and the ability to follow instructions mean that employees learn to cope with challenges and remain disciplined in every situation. Moreover, they can compensate for each other’s weaknesses and develop a problem solving attitude. All of these are highly beneficial for a company or a business to be successful. For instance, a recent research showed that 80% of the successful businesses had more employees who were better team workers than independent workers.
In conclusion, I believe that both kinds of workers are needed in a company. When recruiting staff, employers should look for both skills – the ability to work with others as well as the ability to work independently in some situations.

1304,Some people think that when a person travels into a different culture they should adapt to the local practices and customs. To what extent do you agree?,"According to some people, when we visit a foreign country we should accept /embrace its customs and practices. In my opinion, it is all right to adapt to another culture; however, it should not be at the expense of our own culture. / In my opinion, one should only accept those elements of the foreign culture which one finds acceptable /comfortable with.
While visiting foreign countries or living abroad, one should try to embrace the foreign style of dressing, food habits and other practices only if one finds them pleasant to follow. There is no point in doing something just to fit in. However, before visiting a foreign country it is important to acquire a thorough understanding of their symbols, gestures and heritage to avoid causing offence.
The acceptance of another culture and lifestyle symbolizes respect for the new community and promotes healthy human relations. For instance, candidates running for American President often talk about their admiration for Indian culture to win the vote of Indian Diaspora living in America. That is because as human beings we automatically develop a liking for those who respect our culture and values. Hence, regard for another culture goes a long way in forming long-lasting connections between people of different race and ethnicity.
Although an individual should be appreciative of the practice of the country he visits, they should not be compelled to give up their own customs. Every region has their own religious beliefs and way of living and people should have the freedom to choose the best lifestyle for themselves. This also ensures harmony among the various ethnicities living together. For instance, India is a country of many religious groups preaching their own teachings and language. In such a country, the peaceful environment is maintained by giving everyone the right to select their way of life.
In conclusion, it is a good way of showing acceptance and affection towards others by following their rituals and ideology but it needs to be an option, not an obligation for visitors to comply with. Affection and harmony can only prosper when everyone shows respect for each other’s traditions voluntarily by choice.

1305,Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?,"Nowadays, international tourism is growing at an unprecedented rate. Most of the people opine that this is having a negative impact on their countries. In this essay, I shall discuss two main reasons why people think like this and also recommend some methods to change their attitude towards foreigners.
There are many reasons why most people are against international tourism. Firstly, tourists often disrespect the local culture. As a result, clashes sometimes occur between locals and visitors. Tourists may also spoil heritage buildings by writing on the walls. To illustrate, many tourists visiting the old traditional buildings located at Delhi have been found guilty of writing love notes on their walls. This has adversely affected the original essence of monuments. The huge influx of tourists may also lead to environmental issues. Many times foreigners are least bothered about the environment of the host nations. As a result, they throw rubbish around. Thus, they leave a bad impact on the local people.
However, the attitude of the people living in the host countries can be changed if tourists become conscious of their actions. The government should launch awareness campaigns among tourists to dress and behave appropriately when they visit. In addition, the government can launch various programmes to ensure that locals benefit from tourism.
In conclusion, cultural difference between locals and tourists is the main reason that encourages people to think that international tourism is bad. However, by launching schemes that make local people a direct beneficiary of tourism, the government can change this mindset.",7,many-people-think-that-international-tourism-is-bad-band-7-ielts-essay-sample

Some workers prefer working at the same company all of their working life while others believe that changing the workplace often is more advantageous. Both views will be discussed in the following paragraphs before arriving at a conclusion.
On the one hand, staying in the same organization for long makes employees experts at particular skills and thus helps them grow / climb up the career ladder. For example, a financial officer can become the financial chief executive within 8 years if they work in the same company. A permanent job not only gives chances of getting promoted but also offers several other benefits and hence many people do not want to change their workplace. For instance, when they work in the same environment, employees do not need to change their routine life or travel outside of their city.
On the other hand, it is true to say that working for different organizations allows an employee to earn more experience and perspective. This means that the worker can efficiently improve their other skills. Additionally, when any workers apply for a new company, they can request higher salaries. It is one of the opportunities for employees to make progress in their work life.
In summary, both long-term and short-term jobs offer various benefits for employees. If they choose it properly at the right time and at right place, they will get the optimal outcome.",7,some-people-work-for-the-same-organisation-all-their-working-life-band-7-ielts-essay-sample

Many people believe that using animals for the purpose of experiments is cruel; however, others hold the opinion that for the progress of science it is required. To a great extent, I agree with the argument that doing research on animals is an act of exploitation and we do not have any right to do so.
Misusing the life of innocent animals is not right at all. In our due course of experiments, several animals suffer and even get killed because the tests are done to identify the impacts, which can be positive or negative. For instance, it is found that animals that undergo severe test fall ill because of the dosage of the chemicals which the body cannot resist. As a result, animals suffer severe physical and mental disorders because we are not aware of the consequences of such drugs and their usage.
However, others hold the opinion that for the development of science, these kinds of experiments are highly necessary. It is true that science has greatly helped mankind from severe diseases which were incurable before. With the invention of medicine and various drugs, today we are able to save millions of lives from death and illness. It is found that modern medicine has improved the life span of the human race and is indeed a big success. But still, seeing the tragedy and sufferings of the innocent animals, I believe that it is injustice and we do not have any right to torture these animals for our own interest. Every life on this planet has got equal rights and freedom to live which no one has the liberty to interfere with.
In conclusion, there is no doubt that science has done miracles in improving the lives of human beings but experiments on animals for research is highly unacceptable and therefore is very wrong.",7,some-people-believe-that-the-use-of-animals-for-the-purpose-of-experiments-is-cruel-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1308,Art is considered an important part of the society as well as an expression of its culture. Do you think it is important for the children to be taught art? Do you think children should be encouraged to focus on art rather than other subjects?,"Since time immemorial, art has played a crucial role in depicting the culture of its society. The various forms of ancient art that are studied and researched till date reflect the skill level and knowledge of that era. In the modern society, art is an integral part of school curriculum providing children with freedom to express themselves. However, it is very important that a balance is maintained between studies and arts.
It is a proven fact that art is a good way of releasing tensions and stress. This further helps to bring their creative side out and enables them to express themselves better. For instance, psychologists can understand the thought process of children by studying their drawings. The pictures they create and colors they use show what they feel about the happenings in their surroundings.
But at the same time, it is imperative that equal attention is given to academics as well because not everyone can earn their livelihood from art. For practicing professions like medicine or teaching one has to be academically strong. similarly for jobs like plumbing and carpentry one has to excel in skills that refine with practice. Therefore, children should be encouraged to focus on the academics as well.
To conclude, it is very important to strike a balance between art and academics because both are beneficial in their own ways. If arts provide a platform to express one’s imagination freely, studies provide an opportunity to pursue professional careers. However, in my opinion, pursuing art at the expense of other subjects is not a wise idea.",7,art-is-considered-an-important-part-of-the-society-as-well-as-an-expression-of-its-culture-band-7-ielts-essay-sample

There are some people who would prefer to plan their time activities but there are some who assert that planning is not necessary. I firmly agree with the former statement but in my opinion we may not get a chance to plan things every time and often things happen as a result of spontaneous decisions.
On the one hand, several lines of evidence suggest that planning is very essential for any activity. To begin with, there are many people who do not wish to waste time. They believe in carrying on with the free time activities according to a plan for effective execution. Furthermore, sometimes planning is essential to enjoy certain activities. For example, when we are on a holiday we may want to visit a museum or an amusement park. However, these facilities are not open round the clock and hence some planning is essential to be able to access them. Therefore, planning is necessary. For example, in my own experience whenever I plan for vacation during holidays, I plan things in advance so that it gives me time to arrange all the necessary things required during my vacation. This helps me to enjoy the vacation wholeheartedly.
On the other hand, there are many people who argue that planning is not at all necessary and free time activities should be decided spontaneously. For example, some people are easy going. They immensely enjoy taking unplanned decisions. Secondly, sometimes planned activities get cancelled because of the sudden occurrence of the problems. This is why some people do things without any planning.
In my opinion, planning our free time activities would help us to enjoy our leisure time fully. This aids us to arrange the things required for the execution of our plans. Planning is very crucial to make the event successful. This practice can also help us to save the amount needed. For instance, in my own experience when I plan my vacation in advance I usually get good deals on hotels and flight tickets.
To conclude, planning provides us many benefits. It helps us to enjoy the free time activities fully. Planning helps in executing the event successfully but there are situations where we should keep ourselves ready for unplanned activities.",7,some-people-prefer-to-plan-the-activities-for-their-free-time-carefully-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1310,More and more people in developing countries are purchasing cars for the first time. What problems do this cause? What do you think are the possible solutions?,"A growing number of people in developing nations are buying their own vehicles for the first time. While this is a sign of affluence, it can have a negative impact on the environment.
The main issue associated with the increasing numbers of vehicles is high levels of carbon dioxide emission. Since developing countries have significantly higher population than developed countries, when more people drive cars there the result is a harmful increase in air pollution. Needless to say, there is a dramatic increase in the incidences of respiratory ailments. For example, the major cities in China are suffering from serious atmospheric contamination, and the WHO reported more than five thousand cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and 300 deaths in many nations in 2008. The majority of them were in China.
Making public transport more reliable and cheaper is the most effective way to discourage the excessive use of private vehicles. Another long term solution to this predicament is to educate young people about the dangers of air contamination by exhaust gases from automobiles. Children in schools could be taught about how to reduce the problem. They are also likely to teach their parents about the things they learned at school and adults will also be influenced by this initiative. For instance, students in Netherlands were taught about consequences of driving their own car in a reckless manner, and now the number of drivers has declined. Furthermore, the most preferable transport for Dutch people is bicycles and using public transport or carpooling is common means to travel.
In conclusion, a growing number of people are driving their own vehicles, and this is leading to severe air pollution. The most effective method to tackle this issue is to wake up young generations to the dangers of the poor air quality.",7,more-and-more-people-in-developing-countries-are-purchasing-cars-for-the-first-time-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1311,"Wealthy countries should accept more refugees and provide them with basic assistance, such as food and housing. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people think that more refugees should be allowed to settle in developed countries and be provided the basic needs. This essay completely agrees with that statement because every human being has the right to live and neglecting that need will cause more problems. Refugees have no protection to their life and hence affluent nations should come forward to help them.
According to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Right, everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms, no matter where they come from. For example, many South Koreans immigrated to other countries due to the Korean War in the 1950-60s and they also received aid from the international community. As a result, South Korea overcame the situation quickly, and now they are able to assist other poor countries.
Another reason is the fact that neglecting the refugee problem will cause more negative issues. If displaced people cannot be safe anywhere, they will try to escape from the worst situation to a better place. Eventually, the number of illegal immigrants will increase, and this will likely increase the crime rate. BBC News has reported that ever since Italy implemented its close door policy against refugees, there is a considerable increase in the number of deaths in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to that, this has provoked antagonism between the refugees and wealthy nations and consequently refugees are getting involved in more criminal activities.
In conclusion, economically developed countries should involve in assisting refugees in terms of food supplies and other basic needs and help them to settle down in other nations. After all, helping those in need is our duty as humans and if we neglect it the whole world will pay dearly.",7,wealthy-nations-should-accept-more-refugees-and-provide-them-with-basic-assistance-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1312,"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this day and age, our values have changed tremendously. The social status of a person is determined by their fame and money. By contrast, in the past, people with good moral values were always respected. Some people believe that celebrities are known for their beauty and money instead of their hard work and it causes a bad impact on our younger generation. In my opinion, this is true to a great extent.
Nowadays, money and glamour means everything to most people. They consider them to be the key to success. This is the reason why celebrities have millions of followers on their social networking accounts. People, especially our younger generation, try their best to copy the lifestyle of their favourite celebrities. Whatever celebrities wear and do become the new fashion statement. Big brands make huge profits by hiring celebrities to endorse their products. More people are willing to buy a product if it is endorsed by a celebrity. This popularity enables celebrities to earn a lot of money and people start to believe that stardom is all about money, name and comfort.
Unfortunately, young people do not see or understand the hard work that celebrities put in to become what they are. They only see their luxurious lifestyle and get deluded. Every day they also find ordinary people become instant celebrities thanks to online platforms like Youtube and Instagram. Young people often fall into the traps of depression when they cannot achieve similar fame in spite of working hard. They also fail to understand that instant stardom does not last long.
To conclude, I totally agree with the opinion that celebrities are now rated on the basis of their glamour quotient and bank balance. Unfortunately, this is a negative development. Therefore, it is extremely important that we guide our youth to appreciate hard work good moral values more than money and beauty.",7,celebrities-are-now-more-famous-for-glamour-and-wealth-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1313,"Art is considered as an essential part of all cultures throughout the world. However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology and business. Why do you think this? What could be done to encourage people to take more interest in arts?","Art is a core aspect of our heritage and epitome of our legacy. But recent statistics show that there is a decline of interest in the field of arts, as rapid technological advancements have lured youngsters and adults with the promise of flashy gadgets, powerful computers and so forth. In this essay, I intend to outline the major reasons for this shift and suggest a few ways in which people can be encouraged to invest more time in arts.
Firstly, the major reason for people to focus on science and technology is their immense contribution in making the world a better place. Also these fields generate a lot more jobs than arts. Consequently at university more young people pursue science than arts. Another reason for the declining popularity of arts is that people are now busy with their work and career. Tough competition exists in almost all fields and employees have to upgrade their skills constantly. This leaves them with little time to pursue arts.
However, this causes more harm than good as humans tend to live a robotic, nonchalant life and finally regret having no time to spend with their families or focus on something they love. There are numerous steps that can be taken in order to combat this personal crisis. To begin with, technology itself can be utilized to promote arts in a more advanced and sophisticated way. Secondly local governments or citizens could organize fun events such as photo gallery, dance competitions, painting exhibitions and so on. People are motivated to go to these events when creative work of their friends or family is showcased.
In conclusion, technology is largely responsible for people’s lack of interest in arts; however, in my opinion, the same technology can be used to promote art. This would ensure that there is a clear balance between leisure and work, which can lead to a more productive life.",7,fewer-and-fewer-people-appreciate-arts-these-days
1314,"Children who start reading earlier in life, perform better later on in their school studies. How important are the early reading skills in a child’s academic performance? What other pre-school factors influence a child’s later academic achievements?","Most parents attempt to do what is best for their children’s proper development. Some people believe that teaching children to read early is going to help their future success. However, I do not agree with this notion. Reading skills are certainly important but in my opinion a 3 or 4 year old does not have to learn to read. I believe spending quality time with children and encouraging different play time activities are more / a lot more beneficial for the overall development of a child. In this essay, I will defend my stand / opinion with valid arguments.
Firstly, we should understand that all children are different in terms of capabilities and needs. Hence compelling every child to learn to read from a very young age might prove to be counter-productive. While some children may take to this, others may develop apathy towards reading and this might prove to be a bigger problem when they start school.
Furthermore I believe that if parents and teachers, engage young children in different interesting exercises, it is going to prove to be more fruitful than concentrating only on learning to read. For example, games like puzzles, coloring exercises and musical lessons are a lot more beneficial for the development of their motor and cognitive skills. In turn, this will have a better grip on their reading or speaking and they may learn to read or communicate even faster. Furthermore, I greatly support encouraging children to play outdoor games. This would enable them to be fit and also be in close proximity with nature which will enhance their social and cognitive skills all the more.
Thus, I would like to conclude by saying that if parents give undue importance to introducing their child to reading at a young age, they may miss out on many fun activities. However, I also believe  that reading should be included in a toddler’s schedule so that they are used to books from an early age which is a very good habit to have for their bright future.",7,children-who-start-learning-earlier-perform-better-later-on-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1315,More and more wild animals are on the verge of extinction and others are on the endangered list. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Owing to human activities, many species of wild animals are struggling to survive. This had driven many of them to the verge of extinction and others are on the endangered list. There are several reasons for this. On the bright side, there are also certain measures that we can take to resolve this problem.
The main cause of extinction of the wild animals is deforestation which is done to facilitate the expansion and development of urban areas. Due to this, wild animals lose their natural habitat and this puts their lives at risk. Many of them are forced to wander into villages for food. However, since they pose a threat to people’s lives and property, they are often killed. Excessive poaching is another reason for the extinction of many wild animals. They are killed for the production of luxury goods such as leather bags, shoes and fur coats.
There are several measures that the government and the public can take to undo the damage done to wildlife. First and foremost, the government should launch nationwide campaigns to sensitise people about the importance of conserving wildlife. In addition, there should be strict laws to prevent poaching. The media and the activists can also contribute their bit. They should discourage people from buying products made of animal skin or fur.
To conclude, human activities such as deforestation and mindless hunting are the major reasons for the extinction of wildlife. By enacting strict laws that stop or at least reduce deforestation and poaching, wild animals can be saved from the brink of extinction.",7,more-and-more-wild-animals-are-on-the-verge-of-extinction-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1316,"Some people believe school children should be given multiple short vacations, while others believe they should get one long vacations. Give the advantages of both and express your own point of view.","While some people are in favour of giving several short vacations to children, others opine that one long vacation is much better. In my opinion, children will benefit more if they get several short holidays during the course of the academic year.
There are many advantages to short vacations. To start with, children can take a break from studies frequently. Sometimes taking a short vacation can help children get rid of their mental stress. Nowadays we see that most children attend private coaching classes after school and hence they get hardly any spare time. This can affect them mentally. However if they have a short vacation in between exams they can relax themselves, get rid of their mental stress and feel refreshed. When they get short vacation, they have enough time to spend with their loved ones. They can go to their relative’s house and spend time with them which we don’t see these days.
Getting a long vacation also has its advantages. When they have long vacations they can join some coaching classes like football coaching, swimming, drawing or dancing etc. They can also travel to distant tourist destinations. However, in my opinion, in this age of intense competition and the pressure to excel in both curricular and co-curricular activities, children need small breaks from time to time to recharge themselves.
To conclude, after analysing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that there are benefits to both short and long vacations. However, considering the amount of pressure that children have to deal with on a day-to-day basis, I would recommend more short vacations than one long vacation.

1317,These days many children have difficulty paying attention and concentrating in their classes at school. What are the reasons for this? How can it be dealt with?,"Today many students find it difficult to pay attention in the class. Outdated teaching methods and the distractions caused by technology are the main reasons for this. There are a number of solutions which can be implemented to deal with children who lack attention.
Firstly, the most important reason for the lack of concentration at school is the new world of entertainment such as smart phones, video games and social media. Now children spend most of their time at home playing video games and using social networking sites and this affects their life negatively. Therefore, when they are at school they think of these things and their concentration is affected. Secondly, children are now bored with the old technique of teaching. Furthermore, they find it less interesting, so automatically their attention gets distracted. Moreover, this affects their studies and reflects in their result.
There are effective solutions for these problems. One way to tackle this is to make classroom teaching more interesting. For example, technological innovations can be used in the classroom. To illustrate, with the help of power point presentations schools can make teaching more interesting. For instance, showing animated images and visual effects will help to get children excited about their lessons.
Another method of dealing with children is to focus less on theoretical studies and more on practical studies. For example, if a teacher wants to teach about the manufacturing process of a product, they should consider taking the students to a manufacturing plant. This will help them to learn faster and with interest.
In conclusion, using technology and new ways of teaching can help to solve the problem of attention and concentration in children.",7,these-days-children-have-difficulty-paying-attention-in-the-class
1318,It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children?,"It is common sense that children should learn to distinguish between right and wrong from an early age. Some people believe that the easiest way to accomplish this is to punish them when they do something wrong. I completely disagree with this view.
Children are too young to understand why they are punished. They are easy to link their mistakes to the unhappy experience after punishment. However, they still do not know why their parents are angry with them and how to correct their behaviour because they are not mature enough to reform themselves. Therefore, instead of giving them punishment, parents should have the patience to teach them what is right and explain related moral rules when their children make mistakes. With this approach, children can acquire a deep understanding. In addition, parents need to set good role models for their children; thus, children can copy right behaviour from parents. In sum, punishments make children confused, and children have no right model to follow.
In addition, punishment has a negative effect on children. A better approach is to use encouragement to educate children because it has a positive influence on children. Encouragement gives children the space to try and explore and allow them to make mistakes. At the same time, parents should warn children when they are wrong and tell them what is right rather than punish them. That way they can boost children’s motivation to learn new things without worrying about making mistakes. By contrast, if children are punished when they make mistakes, they will lack a sense of security which is required for their normal development. As result of that, it is hard for them to make progress in the future since they always choose to do nothing to avoid mistakes.
To conclude, punishment is unsuitable to help children learn the distinction between right and wrong and parents should find more understandable and beneficial ways to teach them good behaviour.",7,punishment-is-necessary-to-help-children-learn-the-distinction-between-right-and-wrong-band-7-ielts-essay-sample

1320,The rise of convenience foods has helped people keep up the speed of the modern lifestyle. What are the advantages of this trend? Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"There has been a dramatic change in the lifestyle of people over the years and they have become busier. The availability of readymade food has made it easy to maintain this modern lifestyle. While there are some clear benefits to this situation, I personally believe that the drawbacks are more significant.
The main advantage of the convenience food is that it saves the time which is spent in cooking food. As a result, people can utilize this time for other purposes such as relaxing and doing other recreational activities. Moreover, the productivity of work has increased. For instance, there are many food stalls available at the workplace; thus one finds it convenient to have lunch with so many options to choose. Also, one does not have to wake up early to cook food.
On the other hand, there are many disadvantages associated with readymade food. For example, it may be unhealthy and unhygienic. Firstly, it does not provide complete nutrition and contains preservatives which are harmful if consumed in excess quantity. For example, studies have linked the rise in cancer cases to the high content of preservatives in the packed food. In addition, the standards of hygiene are not maintained in many food stalls. This can lead to the spreading of diseases such as typhoid and cholera and reduce the productivity of people.
To conclude, time saving is the main advantage of the availability of convenience food; however, in my opinion, the disadvantages of regular consumption of readymade food outweigh the advantages. Given this, it is recommended that people should give up their dependence on packaged food and consume more homemade food.",7,the-rise-of-convenience-food-helps-the-modern-lifestyle-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1321,"In many developing countries, there is a problem with declining quality of air and water from both industry and construction. What measures could be taken to prevent this?","Due to urbanization and industrial growth, many developing nations now face the problem of water and air pollution.  This essay will discuss certain measures that can be taken to prevent this problem.
One measure that can be implemented to solve this issue is to form / have strict rules and regulations regarding the location of the industry. If the industry is located within the limits of the city, it will have a major impact on the quality of air and water. Hence, the government should enact laws that stipulate that industries can only be established on the outskirts of the city. In addition to this, the factories should be designed in such a way that they produce less smoke and other harmful particles. For example, the smoke outlet chimney should be constructed so high that the pollutants do not settle in the local surroundings.  This measure will prevent air pollution in many developing countries.
Another measure is to have an effective waste management / disposal system. Industries produce a huge amount of waste products which are then released into the seas and rivers. This results in water pollution. In order to eliminate this issue, industries must be required to segregate their hazardous waste materials and destroy them by using proper waste disposal method such as incineration. For instance, if industrial workers are given training regarding the segregation of materials into separate categories such as plastic, debris and iron, the disposal becomes easier. This method helps in saving the water of developing nations from being polluted.
To conclude, since the quality of air and water is decreasing in developing countries, the government should play a major role in forming various environmental laws.  Enforcement of laws is also very important to tackle the pollution. Also, educating the workers about the safe disposal of waste will reduce pollution to a great extent.",7,air-and-water-pollution-has-become-a-major-problem-in-many-developing-countries-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1322,"In order to reduce crime, some argue that attacking its cause like poverty is the best solution, while others believe that putting more people in prisons and having more policemen are more convenient way in tackling crime. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Nowadays, the increasing rate of crime is a cause for concern. Some people opine that a fight against poverty could help in reducing the crime rate, whereas others think that there are more effective ways to tackle this issue. In my opinion, in addition to reducing poverty, we need better police patrolling and stringent punishments to deal with crime.
It is often thought that that poverty is the biggest cause behind the rising offenses. Often poor people get into the criminal world just to fulfill their basic needs. If employment is given to these people to help them survive, they can definitely be dissuaded from committing crime. Moreover, they will not get time to think over crime because they will be busy doing their jobs. Research shows that 80% of the criminals live below poverty line. They get involved in crime in the urge to get something for their families. Hence, offering a source of income to these people could reduce the crime rate.
However, fighting poverty alone will not improve the situation. Not everyone who commits crime hails from a poor background. Some are hardcore criminals and they can only be reformed with punishment. Moreover, the fear of imprisonment could deter them from committing crime. Additionally, more police security will automatically create fear among the criminals and they will be scared of doing anything wrong in the presence of police. For example, in Delhi, just to give security to the female employees working in night shifts, the government has appointed more police force on roadsides to ensure their safety.
In conclusion, tackling crime is not an easy task but the government can take proper actions to mitigate this issue. By creating more job opportunities for the poor people, increasing police patrolling and awarding stringent punishments for criminals, the government can reduce the crime rate to a great extent.",7,some-think-that-fighting-poverty-is-the-best-way-to-reduce-crime
1323,In some countries the average weight of people is increasing and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing. What do you think are the causes of these problems and what measures could be taken to solve them?,"It is common knowledge that being over-weight is detrimental to our physical and mental well-being. This essay will discuss the reasons that have caused this problem and propose some reasonable solutions.
Generally speaking, it is inevitable that we have to become fatter as we are leading a life with a much higher quality. Back in the olden days, due to bad economic situation and limited range of goods, we were not able to have so many food choices as we do today. Meat and expensive snacks were luxury commodities to us back then. However, things are quite different today. Thanks to economic progress and agriculture development, we are now able to enjoy a wide range of food at minimal cost. As a result of this, people tend to over-buy food and consequently eat more than their body really needs. Creating awareness about the importance of having a healthy diet is the only way to solve this problem. Reading more books and watching more videos on healthy food habits will be very helpful.
Another cause of obesity is the stress of modern life. Studies have shown that people who live highly stressful lives are more likely to be obese. To solve this problem, we have to strike a balance between work and life. For example, during our free time, we should engage in some sort of physical activity. A short walk after meals is a great way to burn some calories.
To conclude, we have to lead a healthy life and gain knowledge about health and diet to avoid being obese. Apart from this, our government should control the sale of foods which are rich in fat. In addition, it should build more sports facilities to encourage people to lead physically active lives.",7,average-weight-of-people-are-increasing-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1324,"In many countries plastic shopping bags are the main type of rubbish. They cause water and land pollution, so they should be banned. To what extent do you agree?","Plastic carry bags form a major chunk of garbage in most countries. They pose a great threat to the environment. Therefore, there is a general consensus that there must be a legal ban on these items. I completely agree with this view.
To begin with, over the last few decades there has been a dramatic increase in the use of plastic bags. They are used everywhere from grocery shops to shopping malls. Most of the times, these bags are not properly disposed. This has led to the contamination of land and water bodies. Furthermore, these plastic wastes are non-biodegradable; hence they remain in the environment for an indefinite period of time. They also pose a great risk to all the animals and fishes that might feed on them. Overall, plastic is a source of hazard for the ecosystem.
Plastic is a versatile material and that is the reason for its popularity. It is cheap and lightweight. It can be used to package a variety of items including liquids. The only way to reduce the use of plastic carry bags is to enforce a strict ban on them. For instance, many cities in India have already prohibited the use of plastic carry bags. This forces people to turn to alternative materials such as bio-degradable or jute bags. This wouldn’t have happened unless stringent laws were passed. Therefore, plastic ban by law is inevitable.
In conclusion, plastic wastes are accumulating all around the globe and posing a great threat to the flora and fauna. However, this vexing problem can be controlled by placing a legal ban on plastic bags.",7,plastic-bags-should-be-banned-band-7-ielts-essay-sample

Why is English such an important international language?","In today’s world English has become a global language. There is a huge increase in the numbers of people moving to English speaking nations every year to learn the language from the natives. People want to study English for the various advantages associated with it.
The most important reason for learning English these days is that English has become the international language of communication in every single part of the world. Although there are only a few countries where English is the first language, it is the most widely spoken language in the world today.
Every country releases their official documents in their local language as well as in English to make sure that their message is communicated. Not only within the country but also for tourists English is a common language which is used by tourist guides to help the visitors from different countries. For instance, there are some South East Asian countries like Taiwan, Hong-Kong and China where visitors from other parts of the world find it hard to survive as local language is not easy to understand. However, the local government of these countries offers free English translating machines to promote tourism in the country.
Another reason for people to travel to English speaking countries for learning English is that learning from native speakers will enable them to acquire the level of proficiency required to clear international English tests. Subsequently, a good level of English helps people to acquire a resident status in the first world countries. For example, last year 30 million people appeared for English exams like TOEFL and IELTS. Learning English not only provides access to information but also throws open a world of opportunities.

1326,Youngsters these days prefer to have a boyfriend or girlfriend. Some people think that getting into a relationship at young age is not good idea. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, many youngsters are getting into romantic relationships but some people argue that this is not a good idea. I completely agree with this because it can create certain issues in their lives.
The most preponderant reason why younger people should not get involved in a romantic relationship / love affair is that it can affect their careers. In other words, while they are in a relationship conflicts are bound to happen and they will increase their stress levels.
As a result, they would not be able to concentrate on their studies or their jobs. For example, a friend of mine got so disturbed because of the regular fights with his girlfriend that he left the job and moved to his native place, and now he is struggling to find employment there. If he had not left the job, he would have received a promotion.
Another reason for not supporting the idea of getting into a relationship at a young age is the risk of unwanted pregnancy. This is because young adults do not care much and mistakes can happen during intimate moments. This can be extremely dangerous. Moreover, if the pregnancy is terminated, it can have detrimental effects on the girl’s health. Also, if they decide to have the baby), it will be a huge financial burden, which can be challenging for some couples. Worse still, they may get ostracised because premarital sex and pregnancy are a taboo in most traditional or orthodox societies.
In conclusion, although youngsters like to be in a relationship, I firmly believe that it should be avoided because it can distract them from their career paths and put them under tremendous pressure. There is also the risk of unwanted pregnancies.",7,youngsters-these-days-prefer-to-have-a-boyfriend-or-girlfriend-band-7-ielts-essay

However, space travel has made little difference to people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Although some people think that space research does not provide much value because it has not been able to find life on any other planet, in my opinion, it has benefitted humans in many ways.
A major contribution of space travel is the exploration of the universe. In ancient times, people were not aware of the common facts related to our earth and other planets. Even the shape of the earth was not confirmed and space travellers made it possible by clicking photographs from the space. The search operations conducted by the researchers contributed to greater understanding of the galaxies in the space. Furthermore, these findings helped us to study the geographical features of our planet, which are important to determine the weather conditions or predict natural disasters.
Heavenly bodies such as asteroids or comets often collide with one another and then their pieces may fall on earth causing destruction. With the help of space research we can detect such threats in advance and take measures to protect our earth.  Not only this, some beliefs in supernatural powers have also been eradicated from the minds of people as they can comprehend the universe with facts, figures and photographs. In addition to this, space travel is an intriguing area of science and attracts many youngsters to join this field.

1328,"Museums and art galleries should concentrate on local works of art, and not show the culture or artworks from other countries. To what extent you agree or disagree?","It is argued that museums and art galleries should only showcase the art works of the host country. I completely disagree with this opinion because in my opinion art is a medium to express thoughts and ideas and it cannot be confined to geographical boundaries.
I believe art is pure in its form and it is a medium to express our ideas and thoughts freely. An artist does not draw a painting by limiting himself to the locality of his origin. He simply pours his expressions and feelings on a piece of paper with different shades of color. These shades and sketches depict the painter’s vision of history, or reality. Such a masterpiece should not be restricted only to local origins; rather, it should be showcased in front of a global audience.
Moreover, when we allow arts and sculptures from a foreign country we are connecting the nations all over the worlds. Each culture has something new to teach. For example, in one of the child museums in India, there are paintings of small children dressed as Zombies. These paintings depict the Halloween festival which is very famous among children in America. Children in India are delighted to know about such festival. Similarly, we have Madame Tussads, a popular celebrity museum in England. The museum hosts wax statues of several famous personalities of all over the world. For example, it hosts the statue of Mahatma Gandhi describing the work he did for achieving India’s independence.
To conclude, museums and art galleries should not be restricted only to local origins and should depict the cultures and artworks of other countries too. This not only helps in buildings relations with other countries but also teaches people to respect and appreciate other cultures.",7,museums-and-art-galleries-should-concentrate-on-local-works-of-arts-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1329,Some people think an international car-free day is an effective way to reduce air pollution. Others think there are more effective ways to do this. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"A certain group of people believe that a day without cars is an effective way to lessen air pollution in many countries. However, some others think differently and insist / argue that there are several alternative ways to maintain air purity. In this essay, I will discuss both views before arriving at a conclusion.
The combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles leads to the emission of harmful gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Diminishing air quality is one of the immediate effects of this emission. A car free day will certainly reduce emission and improve air quality on that day and perhaps on the next day as well; however, it is not a permanent solution because the air quality will worsen as soon as cars return to roads.
A better solution is to reduce or completely stop the burning of coal and other fossil fuels by switching to alternate sources of energy.  A lion’s share of world electricity production is from thermal power plants which use coal as a fuel to generate energy. Thus it is evident that coal is one of the major causes of pollution and its consumption must be reduced. Even though electric vehicles are better alternatives to fossil fuel powered engines, the atmospheric pollution caused by electricity generation from coal is alarmingly increasing.
In conclusion, a car-free day alone does not help much in reducing air pollution. A better solution is to identify and avoid major pollutants. Therefore, in my opinion, limiting the use of coal and exploring renewable sources like solar and hydropower are more effective ways to reduce air pollution.",7,international-car-free-day-solution-to-air-pollution
1330,Most of the societies have its homeless people. Some people think that the best way to help them is to give them money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people do not have homes to live in most parts of the world. According to some, donating money to the homeless is the best option one can choose to help them. I certainly disagree with this viewpoint as it makes them lazy and also there is a chance that the funds will be misused.
Providing monetary help to the homeless people will make them dependent and lazy. People take this as an opportunity to earn easy money instead of finding ways to earn legitimately. Hence it is better to provide work to the homeless so that they can earn money to build a home. For instance, the Telangana state government provided employment opportunities to the villages without homes. Moreover it helped them to get bank loans to build their home. This is an innovative idea by the government which benefits the people with homes as well as jobs.
On the other hand, there is a chance of fund diversion if people are helped with money. Most of the homeless are unemployed and may have different necessities other than a house. So, they may end up using this money for other purposes. For example, most of the people who live in the slums do not have enough money to spend on their daily needs. Any money given to these people will be spent on their primary needs such as food and clothing. Hence, giving them money to build homes is not advisable.
In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea of giving money to the homeless as this money will not be utilized for building homes. Moreover, it will also make them dependent on easy money options.",7,the-government-should-give-money-to-homeless-people-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1331,Some companies allow their employees to work at home. What are the advantages and disadvantages for the individual and society?,"Teleworking has become more popular in recent times. In my point of view, working from home has significant benefits in terms of time management; however, it reduces human interactions considerably. In this essay, I will discuss both sides using examples to support arguments and demonstrate points.
On the one hand, the main positive benefit of working remotely is that employees can save time and money on their daily commute. This is largely because employees spend an important amount of time just moving from one place to another. This time can be better invested in completing tasks at home. For example, according to “Employee First Magazine” there is a new law project in Italy that aims to include commuting time within the working hours. Therefore, teleworking allows people to spend time efficiently.
On the other hand, despite the fact that people can be more efficient at home, workplaces give the opportunity to have human interactions. This is due to the fact that building relationships with colleagues is essential in order to reduce depression or even suicides, because people can talk face to face about their problems. For instance, a recent study by Colorado University has shown that working from home can increase the risk of depression by 12%. Thus, freelancing limits the social interactions of employees.
To conclude, from the examples and arguments given above, I firmly believe that working from home has some benefits. For example, it allows employees to save time. At the same, it has some drawbacks in that it reduces interactions among people.",7,what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-working-from-home-band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1332,"Social media is becoming increasingly popular among all age groups. However, sharing personal information on social media websites does have risks. Do you think that the advantages of social media outweigh the disadvantages?","There is no doubt that many people rely more on the Internet for the latest news or trends. Although its utilization has disadvantages such as the threat to privacy, I believe they are outweighed by its advantages and I will support this argument with valid examples.
To begin with, some opine that posting private information on the Internet websites may bring security problems. This is because once the individual shares their current location online, their enemies / opponents can plan strategies to hurt/harm them. To illustrate, in recent times the number of attacks on women have increased because their movements can be easily monitored through social media. If an individual is not posting any secure information online, such attacks can be lowered. Thus, many people oppose the extensive use of social networks to protect their privacy and security.
On the other hand, I agree with the argument that many people nowadays are utilizing social media as a common platform to connect with each other. The reason for this is that with the help of renowned websites like Facebook, Twitter and Linked-in, people can connect to friends and family living in different parts of the world and also make new connections. For example, multiple job requirements are posted online; people who are subscribed to such information can utilize this information. There are also many newspapers that post the same information but print media takes more time than online media to reach the public. Hence, new generation is making an advantage of fast and reliable media.
To conclude, there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with Internet usage. In my view the benefits such as faster connectivity and access to information outweigh the demerits.",7,social-media-is-becoming-increasingly-popular-among-all-age-groups
1333,"In some societies, the number of crimes committed by teenagers is growing. Some people think that regardless of age, teenagers who commit major crimes should receive adult punishment. To what extent do you agree?","Adolescents are increasingly committing crimes in certain societies. Some people argue that adolescents should receive the same punishment as adults for committing serious crimes. I agree with this statement because of the reasons which will be discussed in this essay.
Adolescents are mature enough to understand what is right and wrong. This is because in the modern society, they are exposed to various sources of information in the world through online and offline media. Unlike the teenagers of previous generations, young adults in the current society know just about everything. They know how to differentiate moral activities from immoral activities. Obviously, they are required to behave appropriately all the time.
When children between the age of 12 and 19 commit crimes, it is necessary that they should be punished appropriately in order to control their immoral behaviours. They should be punished in the same way as adults and it will become a lesson to all teenagers. If the judicial system is lenient towards young adults in terms of punishment, they will take it as an advantage and repeat crimes in future. Recently, in India some people brutally raped an eight year old girl. A teenager is also involved in this heinous crime. According to the police reports, the teenager who was involved in the crime inflicted more pain and injury to the child than adults. If this boy is not given the same punishment as other adults, it is sure that he will repeat the same offense in future. Lives of many young girls will be jeopardised if the legal system does not punish him adequately.
In conclusion, teenagers should also be given the same punishment as adults in order to control their criminal tendencies because they are mature enough to differentiate legal activities from illegal activities.",7,band-8-ielts-essay-sample-4
1334,Multinational companies are becoming increasingly common in developing countries. What are the advantage and disadvantages of this?,"More and more multinational companies are setting up their branches / offices in developing countries. The primary advantage of having large scale industries is that they will increase employment and reduce poverty, but the main drawback is that they force employees to work hard.
Global organizations often bring employment to developing nations. Nowadays, every nation produces a lot of doctors, scientists and engineers but fails to give them a deserving job. When multinational companies set up their offices in developing nations, talented and educated people get good jobs. For example, a study conducted by Times reported that Indian graduates from STEM do not like to leave their nation in search of better opportunities in foreign nations because they are able to find suitable jobs within the country. Moreover, big industries create jobs not only for skilled workers but also for unskilled workers.
China is another example. It is known as a manufacturing hub because companies like Apple and Google manufacture their products there.  However, the major drawback of multinational company investment is that employees are forced to work harder and yet they are paid less than their counterparts in developed countries.
Many times employees complain that their employers compel them to work overtime to meet their targets. For instance, Indian Multinational IT industries force their employees to work more than 8 hours to complete their tasks to hand over assignments to the clients located across the Atlantic.
In conclusion, global companies in developing nations bring jobs to the skilled and unskilled labor and help individuals live the good life, but they also force them to change their lifestyle by asking them to work overtime.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-2
1335,Some people think that the government should decide the subject for students to study in university. Others believe that students should be allowed to apply for the subject they prefer. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Some believe that the government is the right authority to choose the subjects while others insist that students should be allowed to choose their subjects. In my opinion, the government can take better decisions than students because they have the guidance of experienced teachers and other experts.
Nowadays, people feel that students are knowledgeable enough to decide what they want to study. They are not only aware of the suitable career options but also understand the means to achieve them. For instance, with the advent of social media they are well connected with college seniors and expert teachers from around the globe that all the latest developments in their field are well known to them. Overall, most of the students are intelligent enough to understand where they are heading.
However, when it comes to designing courses, the government can take better decisions. This is because the government receives sound advice from teachers and educationists. In addition, they are also well aware of the job opportunities available within the country and outside of it. Consequently, they can design courses that offer better employment opportunities for children. By contrast, if students are given the right to choose their topics, they may opt for subjects they find interesting without considering the job prospects.
To conclude, whether the subjects should be selected by the government or the students continues to be a debatable topic. This essay discussed why it is apt to give students this right and why giving that power to the government is a superior choice. In my opinion, the government has better exposure and understanding than students to decide what future generation should learn.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-some-people-think-that-the-government-should-decide-the-subject-for-students-to-study-in-university
1336,"In the past people liked to store knowledge in books. However, in the present, we prefer to store knowledge on the internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","Unlike in the past, information is now being increasingly stored on the internet. In my opinion, there are more benefits than disadvantages to this practice.
Despite the disadvantages mentioned below, I believe that the knowledge stored on the internet can offer extensive benefits for everyone in the present. Firstly, this source of knowledge is easily accessible from any location. In other words, anyone with access to the internet  can quickly access the knowledge without any geographical constraints. Secondly, knowledge stored online is highly secure. In this digital world, we have many security standards to keep our information safe online. Furthermore, online information can be shared fast. Anyone can share the link of a piece of information over internet to someone else within seconds.
Admittedly, there are some minor problems to storing knowledge on the internet. One minor issue is the cost of buying digital devices to access the internet. Some digital devices could be an expensive option for some, whereas books can be a cheaper option to get the same knowledge. Another possible issue is the strain on eyes. For instance, if someone is working on the internet for longer duration, it might lead to some strain on eyes and can cause some stress as well. Although this is not a very common issue, books can still be a safer option.
In conclusion, benefits such as easy access to knowledge and security standards far outweigh the minor drawbacks that could result from storing knowledge on the internet.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-in-the-past-people-liked-to-store-knowledge-in-books-however-in-the-present-we-prefer-to-store-knowledge-on-the-internet
1337,A Job for life is no longer a reality. Many people are now employed on short-term contracts. What are the advantages & disadvantages of this kind of employment?,"The unprecedented advancements in technological and industrial fields have resulted in gigantic changes in the workplace. In the current scenario, the workforce is hired on a temporary basis unlike in the past when jobs were permanent and long-lasting. There are a number of advantages as well as disadvantages to such short-term contract employment and they are discussed below.
Contract jobs mainly benefit the organization. To start with, the biggest advantage of contractual jobs is that the employees learn and adapt to evolving needs of the industry. Since there is cut-throat competition for the limited jobs, the workers are bound to update their knowledge from time-to-time to stay relevant in such a work environment. They also learn to multi-task. Furthermore, the time constraints encourage workers to come out of their comfort zone and work even harder so that their contracts will be extended further.
On the flip side, employees do not gain much from short-term contract jobs. The first and foremost disadvantage is that such jobs are highly insecure. Workers live in constant / perpetual fear of losing their work and this affects their performance. Also, there is usually high competition owing to limited work opportunities. In addition, contract jobs may result in higher levels of unemployment in an economy.
To conclude, although contract jobs have become part of a worker’s life, I believe that employers are the main beneficiaries of this kind of employment.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-a-job-for-life-is-no-longer-a-reality-many-people-are-now-employed-on-short-term-contracts
1338,"Discipline is an ever increasing problem in modern schools. Some people think that discipline should be the responsibility of teachers, while others think that this is the role of parents. Discuss both sides and give our opinion.","It is true that many schools now have to contend with a lack of discipline among students. Some argue that teachers should play a vital role in enforcing discipline at school while others hold parents responsible for this. In my opinion, both parents and teachers have an equally important role in raising disciplined children.
Over the years, schools are observing increased rate of acts of indiscipline by pupils. So, some people insist that since children spend most of their time in schools, teachers should play a crucial role in inculcating discipline in them. Furthermore, due to their influence, teachers can easily develop good manners in children. Also, due to the fear of being reprimanded or punished by teachers or the principal, children are more receptive to the teachings of discipline from teachers.
On the other hand, others argue that teachers have other important tasks at school, so parents should primarily teach discipline to their wards. Also, most of the time children learn bad behaviour from home. Since parents don’t give them constant attention, they get the leeway to be mischievous at home. They may repeat the same behaviour at school. If parents enforce strict rules of discipline at home, this can be prevented to a great extent. What’s more, parents can appropriately punish their children without causing them too much distress whereas punishments from teachers can be embarrassing and may make a child rebellious.
To conclude, it is evident that parents and teachers should share the responsibility of inculcating discipline in children.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-discipline-is-an-ever-increasing-problem-in-modern-schools
1339,"News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. What factors do you think influence these decisions? Do we become used to bad news, and would it be better if more good news was reported?","It is true that content whether it is on television or in newspapers is in the hands of editors. They decide what to print or air based on several factors. Most of the time media houses highlight negative news because of its shock value; however, in my opinion, media should give more importance to positive news.
Mass media plays a significant role in our day to day lives as it keeps us updated about national and international affairs. However, the credibility of several news stories has been questioned in recent times due to a variety of factors. Firstly, some editors are profit-minded; they modify manipulate the truth and present it in such a way that it remains the talk of the town for a long time by adding gossips and rumours into it. For example, they publish or broadcast whatever they hear about celebrities without checking the facts first despite knowing that this is an unethical practice.
Secondly, many articles are politically influenced and oftentimes, the editors are helpless in this case. For example, while launching any new government scheme, they focus only on those aspects of it by which the political party can create its vote bank overlooking public interest. Finally, the selection of news is also influenced by the interests and concerns of the local public.
I believe that people are more accustomed to negative news due to their constant exposure to it and un-ethical marketing strategies of mass-media, but this practice / phenomenon has long-term negative consequences. The role of media is to make us aware of the happenings around and their implications on us. If they show better side of any news, people would be more fearless and confident about the surroundings. In addition to that children are vulnerable to negative news; they take it very seriously affecting their psychological health.
In conclusion, many factors influence an editor’s decisions while publishing any news. In my opinion, editors should show their commitment to the society by using their discretion while selecting news stories. It is also imperative that positive news gets the coverage it deserves.",7,band-7-essay-sample-news-editors-decide-what-to-broadcast-on-television-and-what-to-print-in-newspapers

Some people think that the local business will bring about the death of local communities. To what extent you agree or disagree?
Supermarkets are gaining huge popularity in certain countries and local businesses are finding it difficult to compete with them. Some people have the opinion that the end of local businesses can lead to the death of local communities. I disagree with this statement because of the reasons described in this essay.
Many new supermarkets and shopping malls are emerging in many places. It is difficult for small businesses in local areas to compete with these kinds of large businesses. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, beautiful architecture, ambience and other facilities such as car parking attract many people towards supermarkets. Shopping is no longer just buying things, but it is also a kind of entertainment for people in the modern society. Secondly, supermarkets make shopping easy for people as they can buy all the items which are necessary from one shop. Going to different shops for getting different items is tedious and time consuming.
However, closure of local businesses will not lead to the death of a community. People live happily in localities even if local shops are not available. As a result of the growth of technology and global economy, people now have enough money and transportation facilities to travel to big markets in distant places. Therefore it is not necessary for them to depend on nearby local shops to meet their needs. For example, metro trains which can take people faster to shopping malls are now available.
In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that the closure of local shops can lead to the death of local communities.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-local-shops-are-closing-down-because-of-supermarkets
1341,"In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","These days, it seems that more people prefer to live independently than ever before in many parts of the world. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the effects of living alone are positive or negative. While there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, I personally believe that the drawbacks of living alone far outweigh its benefits. These drawbacks are twofold.
A good reason to oppose the one person household is that this way of living has an adverse impact on human psychology. For example, a recent study revealed that this lifestyle is the main cause of stress because people who live alone often have no one to share their problems with. This has a detrimental impact on their emotional health and wellbeing.
Furthermore, our lives have many occasions and events to be celebrated with loving family such as New Year, birthday and so on. A singleton misses these happy moments altogether increasing their risk of suffering from psychological problems. Worse still, they do not have anyone to take care of them when they fall ill.
Another point to consider is that as the price of commodities and apartments are skyrocketing, someone who lives alone is bound to have too much financial burden on themselves. This, in turn, forces those people to work unbelievably hard as they cannot expect any financial backing from their family or relatives in most cases.
In conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that living alone has a negative impact on our psychological health and financial situation.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-more-and-more-people-are-living-alone
1342,"In many countries, as people are earning more these days, they are also spending money in buying more and more items. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","In today’s world, people find more happiness in earning and spending money. Although it is true that we should get enough salary to earn a living, in my opinion, the tendency of wasting money for unnecessary things definitely does have detrimental effects on the individual and the society.
By spending money on unnecessary items, an individual is doing himself more harm than good. For instance, a person working as an information technology professional might be used to an opulent lifestyle. He might find pleasure in purchasing smart phones and other electronic goods. However, if he does not have the habit of saving money, he will definitely run into trouble sooner or later. In other words, if an individual does not have interest in investing money, it will lead him to a financial crisis. Moreover, the extravagant lifestyle of an individual may influence those around him.
Most probably, people become more selfish as they earn more and do not give attention to the family members and the poor people in the society. This situation, therefore, deteriorates the value of relationship and the significance of social harmony. In short, the habit of spending money unnecessarily, makes a person self-oriented, which in turn, negatively influences their dependents and other people in the society.
In conclusion, instead of spending lavishly, people should save something for a rainy day and also use at least a small portion of their money for the welfare of the society. If one person monitored his monetary condition seriously and modified it accordingly, plenty of others would be inspired to make changes.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample
1343,"What is the best invention of last 100 years, the computer, antibiotics, the airplane, and explain why?","Technology played a vital role in our development during the last century. People often debate which invention is the most important one. While some people argue that antibiotics are the best, in my opinion, computers impacted our life more significantly. This does not mean that other inventions are not important; however, the impact of computers has been simply phenomenal so much so that it is now impossible to even imagine a world without computers.
Computers have had a positive impact on almost all spheres of our lives. To begin with, the emergence of computers has helped our world to advance as they provide enormous services in different fields. Computers facilitated instant transfer of information between people living in different parts of the world.
This plays a major role in enhancing the ways of communication in our entire world. For example, documents could be attached and sent by emails which save cost and time.Another reason that makes computers more important is their power to control and design different machines by using software. A computer has the ability to measure and build components systematically and hence allows the inventor to test their patents. Airplanes, for instance, are basically built and controlled by the help of computers. Without the technology of computers, our world would have struggled to develop and enhance in different aspects.
All in all, computers have surpassed other inventions and proved to be successful in developing our world. The above mentioned examples and arguments prove that computers are the best and most significant invention of the last century.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-what-is-the-greatest-invention-of-the-last-100-years
1344,"In many cities today, most people live in large apartment blocks. Does this kind of accommodation have more advantages or disadvantages?","Nowadays, in most cities across the globe, many people opt to live in big apartment buildings. In my opinion, this type of accommodation has far more benefits than drawbacks. Let me explain in more detail.
To begin with, one of the main advantages of big apartment buildings is that they help in lowering housing prices. As more and more people move to cities for a better life, city authorities will struggle to accommodate them if they don’t build large apartment buildings.
For instance, the Japanese city of Tokyo tackled the problem of high housing prices by building big apartment buildings. As a result, Tokyo has now one of the cheapest housing prices in the world. All in all, big apartment buildings help stabilize the housing markets.
Another benefit of big apartment buildings is that they help people come together as communities. It is very easy for them to socialize and make friends as they live closer to each other. For example, in 2010, a survey which was conducted in Australia found that people who live in apartment buildings are more sociable than those who live in houses and other types of accommodation.  Also they experience less loneliness than people living in standalone houses. In addition, apartments are safer and have a lot of amenities that houses do not have. For example, they may have club houses, swimming pools and gyms.
To sum up, I strongly believe that big apartment buildings have more benefits than drawbacks. They make housing more affordable and bring people together.",7,band-7-5-ielts-essay-sample-do-apartments-have-more-advantages-than-houses
1345,Most artists earn low salaries and should therefore receive funding from the government in order for them to continue with their work. To what extent you agree?,"Some people believe that the majority of artists earn low salaries and hence government funding is necessary for them to continue with their profession. I strongly disagree with this statement because of the reasons mentioned below.
Most of the talented artists are earning good salary. In any field of art, hardworking and skilful artists have successful life with enough fame and money. More specifically, actors, painters, writers and dancers are getting good remuneration for their performance. Paintings of good painters are sold for a great deal of money. It is well known to the public that dancers and actors lead highly luxurious lives.
Government funding is not at all required for these artists. Most of the artists are leading good standard life compared to many other people in the society.  In other words, there are many sections of people who are really poor and actually need some help from the government to meet their basic needs such as food, clothes and education. For example, there are many people who do not have a proper house to stay in. Road workers and construction workers are earning low wages. There are many families where there are sick males who are unable to do any job. So, the government should give its help and support to these poorer sections of the society.
Another argument against giving financial aid to artists is that most of them have some sort of university education. So if they are not able to earn as much as they want, they can do some other job to supplement their income.
In conclusion, artists are getting enough income and government support is not mandatory for them. Therefore I strongly disagree with the statement.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-artists-should-receive-government-aid
1346,"Over the past fifty years, international sports events such as the Olympic Games and world cup competitions have played an increasingly important role in our society. However, many people think such events are an enormous waste of money, time and effort. Do you agree?","In the last five decades, sports competitions have become an essential part of any society. Some people opine that a lot of resources are invested and wasted in these events. This essay disagrees with the given statement that governments spend too much money, preparation time and energy for international tournaments because the host country receives benefits, such as more  visitors and international recognition during the games.
No doubt, international sports competitions encourage people to visit the country that hosts the matches. This tourism boosts all the sectors of the nation’s economy. Tourists spend a large amount of money on food, goods, transport, souvenirs, tours and entry fees to the matches. For example, Brazil received more than 5 millions of tourists during the last World Cup. Their efforts paid off well because the revenue from the event was much higher than the amount they spent on it.
In addition, when a country hosts a huge international tournament, it will gain a lot of global recognition. The host nation receives a lot of media attention before, during and after the games. Television channels, radio stations, newspapers and social media offer up to the moment information on the games and the host country. To illustrate, my Korean classmate had not known that Brazil is located in South America until he saw the inauguration of the World Cup 2014.
In conclusion, although governments invest large amounts of funds to host an international sports competition, in my opinion the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. These events attract more tourists to the country and improve their economy.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-international-sporting-events-are-a-waste-of-money-and-time
1347,Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school. Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.,"People have different opinions on whether home-schooling or a formal education would be a better option for children. While I agree that attending local schools would enhance a child’s social communication skills, I believe that applying the ‘home-schooling method’ up to a certain age would bring benefits in other perspectives. In this essay, I will discuss the plus points of both approaches and share my view.
To begin with, children learn more than just academic knowledge by turning up to schools. The traditional education system promotes a balanced curriculum, covering the other non-academic areas including arts, music, sports and more. As result, children are guided to discover their unique talents, which parents could then continue to nurture. Furthermore, learning in a classroom enables children to interact with their classmates, and at the same time, understanding the importance of teamwork. In my opinion, these group activities would frame their personal traits to tolerate and care for the others as they grow up.
On the other hand, home-schooling might be beneficial in the earlier stage as parents could tailor the curriculum and emphasise on the areas that their child are weaker in. For example, one child might face difficulties in math while most of their classmates find challenges in literacy skills. With the home-schooling system, children are pardoned to not keep up with the learning progress of the majorities. In addition, learning at home during the earlier stages could save children from getting in touch with possible negative influences in school.

1348,"Today more and more tourists are visiting places where the conditions are difficult, such as the Sahara Desert or The Antarctic. What are the benefits and disadvantages for tourists who visit such places?","Nowadays the number of people traveling to explore and visit places with harsh conditions is gradually increasing. Although visiting places like Sahara Desert or the Antarctic can be a lifetime experience and help raise awareness of these places, but it also has drawback that should be taken into consideration.
Traveling to places like deserts or the Antarctic can be beneficial in many ways. Firstly, visiting places with unique weather and landscape could be one of the significant experiences people could have in their life. For example, sleeping in an igloo on the coldest spot on earth is the most exciting thing a person could try. Driving through the hottest biggest desert in the world, moreover, might give you the ultimate memory. Exploring these places will result in a great memory people will always look back at. Secondly, the more people visit these places the more awareness it will raise about it. Travellers will take photos of these places during their visit. Others will either write or talked about it to friends and family members. As a result,more people will get to know about it from previous visitors.
On the other hand, exploring places with harsh conditions can be detrimental. One problem people might face is that these places are not totally safe due to their conditions. Walking through the desert, for instance, can expose people to face a poisonous dessert snake. Sleeping in an igloo, furthermore, can increase the possibility of getting bronchitis due to it extreme low temperature. As a result, people might face serious issues there. Another major problem is that these places lack important services such as, well equipped hospitals or 24/ 7 internet connection. Any minor health issue might end up becoming serious or life-threatening because of the poor hospital services they have. Weak internet connection also is crucial for tourists lost in the dessert and may result in a negative way.
In conclusion, while touring places like Sahara Desert and the Antarctic with tough conditions might be the best trip ever it may also cause someone their life as a result of the unsafe environment or the lack of the essential services.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-more-and-more-people-are-visiting-places-where-conditions-are-hard
1349,Nowadays for many people the internet is replacing regular books. What do you think will happen in the future and what is your opinion about this trend?,"Reading behaviour has been considerably affected by the internet revolution. Many individuals have shifted their reading behaviour toward digital and e-books, instead of the traditional printed books. In my opinion, this positive phenomenon will continue to grow as more book readers will adopt the new online reading methods; meanwhile, publishers and book stores will strive to find new strategies to survive.
On the one hand, the increase in popularity of digital reading is influenced by the benefits that the internet can provide. Firstly, the internet eliminates the geographical boundaries and save considerable time. Now, readers behind their screens can choose their books, purchase and download them without waiting till the book is imported and arrive to their local book stores. Moreover, book readers have more freedom of choice, because digital books bypass the strict regulations on publications which are imposed by some governments.
Secondly, e-books are more convenient than regular books. They are cheaper, as its save cost of printing, and shipping. Furthermore, online books can be either saved on the clouds or on the hard disk, which spare the physical spaces.
On the other hand, book publishers and book stores will face considerable challenges since they continuously lose customers and market shares. They are obligate to find strategies to cope with the new trend of readers’ behaviours; otherwise, they will be out of the market. Many of large publishing companies and book stores have already transformed themselves into online book stores. However, local publishing and book stores will be disappeared, as they can not bear the cost of shifting into online stores.
To sum up, I consider, the benefit of having online books is one of the best outcomes of the internet, and in the foreseeable future more people will shift into online reading.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-the-internet-is-replacing-printed-books
1350,"Today more and more tourists are visiting places where the conditions are difficult, such as the Sahara desert or The Antarctic. What are the benefits and disadvantages for tourists who visit such places?","Recently, it has been a trend for tourists to visit places with harsh conditions. Some people will have a unique experience traveling to these places because it is something that you do not live in your daily life. However, there are some downsides for this kind of trips where the people´s health or physical condition might be compromised. This essay will show both sides.
Visiting a place with a threat to your life may be exciting for some travelers and this feeling could benefit your appreciation for life and health. People are amused by the sort of scenery and landscape that they might find in isolated places where the human being has not touch any of nature. Therefore, they may find a connection with themselves and feel a relief of their lives looking for a new purpose that they did not have before they witness the wonders of the world. Also, for some people traveling to inhabited and peaceful places could improve their health in several ways. For example, It was reported by The University of Cambridge in 2016 that people who lived for a month in the Brazilian Jungle improved their sight by sixty percent in comparison to those who lived in the city with their regular life.
On the other hand, traveling to landmarks with difficult conditions might create a problem to those tourists who are mentally weak or technology based. The isolation feeling could make you feel homesick and start crying or feeling depressed and not finishing your trip without even visiting the best parts yet. To illustrate, a survey done by The Institute of Tourism in Africa showed that almost twenty-five percent of tourists crossing the Sahara desert did not finish the tour because they were feeling isolated and the conditions were too extreme for them, The result was that they had to be evacuated by an emergency helicopter. Also for those, who are technology dependent this experience might be frustrating as they cannot be on-line with the modern world. People, who are frequently connected via internet might find the experience bored because in those places there are not internet connection or cafes and this can be a huge drawback for these travelers.
To conclude, exploring places that have an uncommon condition could be a positive trip for some people looking for a spiritual experience or a health improvement. However, for those who are afraid of losing their comfort zone and the connection with the 21st century, this kind of excursion might be a disappointing idea due to the facilities that these places lack.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-more-and-more-people-are-visiting-places-where-conditions-are-difficult
1351,Wealthy countries should accept more refugees and provide them with basic assistance such as food and housing. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that developed nations need to help refugees from countries affected by war and provide them with the basic necessities. I agree with this view because rich countries have enough resources to sustain poor people.
Rich nations have the financial resources to sustain these people whose needs are basic.The countries like the UK, the USA  and Germany have huge budgets which are collected in the form of tax from their citizens and companies in their territory. It is not a big deal for these countries to use their resources for the benefit of affected people. For example, the estimated GDP of European Union is over $25 trillion and all Syrian refugees could be resettled for a less than a billion dollars.
Wealthy countries have a moral reason to support. Refugees come from lands ravished by war and hunger. Nobody wants to leave their home turf and their families unless it is essential to do so and if these countries refuse to take them in, they will certainly be in danger of losing their lives. For example, people from Syria have no food and they are disturbed with the war environment and that is the main reason nearly 8 million of them have tried to flee their country.
In conclusion, the rich nations need to provide help to resettle refugees because they can afford it easily and thus they can help to save many lives. All over the world people have the same basic needs and it is not fair them to deny them that just because they belong to a foreign country.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-wealthy-nations-should-accept-refugees
1352,"There seems to be an increase in the number of serious crimes committed each year. While some think the best way to solve this problem is to use the death penalty as a deterrent, many people believe that other measures will be needed. Discuss both sides.","While some people think that the increasing number of serious crimes can be tackled by offering death penalty to the offenders, others are of the opinion that some other measures are required. In my opinion, the government has to focus on certain measures to deal with the ever increasing number of serious crimes.
On the one hand, some people believe that the crime rate will decrease if the government introduces certain measures. Firstly, vocational training should be offered to culprits while they serve their prison sentence. This will allow them to find a job after the completion of their sentence. Also when they are able to meet their needs, they are less likely to get into criminal activities in the future. Secondly, rehabilitation classes have to be conducted in prisons to educate the criminals about the aftermaths of crimes in the society. To elaborate they should be taught how crime affects the law and order situation of the society. Thirdly, the government has to organise campaigns to educate the public about the importance of accepting the criminals once they return to normal life after serving jail term.
On the other hand, there are opponents who consider that capital punishment is the best way to deal with serious offences. It cannot be denied that dangerous crimes are on the rise as people think that death punishment is not awarded very often. Therefore, they argue that death penalty must be offered to crimes such as rape and terrorist activities to bring about peace and harmony in the community.
In conclusion, even though people have diverse opinions about awarding capital punishment to deal with serious crimes, I think that measures such as offering vocational training and conducting rehabilitation classes in prisons will help to reduce the number of crimes to a certain extent.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-there-is-an-increase-in-the-number-of-crimes-committed-each-year
1353,It is sometimes thought that people who travel outside of their own country are more tolerant and understanding of others. To what extent do you agree?,"International travel allows people to gain a deeper understanding of foreign countries and cultures. It is also argued that it contributes positively to an individual’s way of thinking. I agree with the argument that people who travel overseas are more likely to be tolerant and cooperative.
To begin with, people of different nationalities have their own traditions, beliefs and behaviours. If an individual decides to go abroad for a short-time, they may encounter many challenges during their visit such as language, food and local culture. This experience helps to broaden their horizons and their mindset. Studies have shown that a person is more likely to improve his level of tolerance and understanding of cultures and people when they travel abroad. Therefore, international travel is often seen as an important life experience.
Another point is that individuals who have visited international destinations tend to change their view about social problems in their own country. For example, it is noticeable that many countries face the problem of racism in certain ways. However, if people had some experience travelling abroad, they are more likely to accept and respect race, beliefs and cultures. Moreover, they try to imitate certain behaviours in order to feel more comfortable themselves when interacting with local people. By contrast, if a society is less tolerant and less understanding, the community as a whole will not overcome their social problems.
In conclusion, having the opportunities to meet and interact with people of different cultures has an impact on the way people think about their own traditions. It helps to rethink and open the mind to embrace more of the values and traditions of their own country.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-people-who-have-traveled-abroad-are-more-tolerant
1354,"Some parents believe that children should go to school; others feel that they should be taught at home. In my opinion, going to school is more beneficial for children than being taught at home.","Some parents believe that children should go to school; others feel that they should be taught at home. In my opinion, going to school is more beneficial for children than being taught at home.
There are a number of reasons why parents think that teaching children at home is the best way of schooling. Firstly, they believe that when children are taught at home they will not be influenced by the ideologies such as religious beliefs or political preferences that most schools usually have. Secondly, some adults feel that children could benefit from learning specialised subjects that suit their skills. Lastly, some people often agree that teaching children at home is more practical and cheaper than sending them to a school, as this helps to save not only money but also time.
On the other hand, there are some strong reasons to believe that schools are a much better place to educate children. To begin with, at school children are taught by experts and this helps them to improve in an overall and integral way. Another reason is that children will socialise and interact with other children coming from different backgrounds and this will help them to broaden their minds as well as develop respect for others. A final reason is that children would not only improve important skills such as team work and leadership, but also learn about values like friendship and responsibility.
To summarise, the advantages of attending a school outweigh the advantages of studying at home. The most important thing that must be considered, regardless of the option, is that children must be taught with tolerance, respect and love.",7,band-7-essay-sample-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-teaching-children-at-home-and-school
1355,"Some people believe that to protect local culture, tourism should be banned in some areas whereas others think that change is inevitable and banning tourism will have no benefits. Discuss both sides and gives your opinion.","Tourism has become an indispensable source of income for many countries and communities. Some people claim that some areas are susceptible to culture loss and therefore, they should be closed entirely to tourists; however others insist that this measure is not beneficial to the locals. In this essay, I will discuss both views and then give my opinion.
On the one hand, supporters of banning tourism often argue that religious, linguistic and socio-cultural behavior will likely be more affected by the influx of tourists. Tourists often interact with the local people in different ways, and the locals may adopt certain foreign practices and customs. This may be bad for traditional local culture. For example, children in touristy areas may prefer to speak foreign languages rather than native languages because they want to communicate with the tourists. Some people, therefore, feel that closing such areas to tourists is the easiest way to conserve local culture and traditions.
On the flip side, banning tourism can have an adverse effect on local economy. Also some cultural changes may inevitably happen whether we allow tourists or not. There are many local communities that survive on tourism. If tourists stop coming, local businesses will retire and unemployment rate will increase. The negative economic consequences of banning tourism are worse than any cultural loss that may occur from the arrival of tourists.
In my opinion, if we want to preserve our values and traditions it is not necessary to close tourist places, because the consequences of doing that will be profoundly devastating. Local authorities and individuals should work together to promote local culture and raise campaigns. This can be done by using many forms of communication like television, internet or radio.

1356,Smacking children is the best form of discipline. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is certainly true that children are behaving more inappropriate these days; consequently, most people believe that the best way to discipline them is to give them physical punishment. I don’t agree with this view. I personally think that even if they behave badly smacking children is completely unacceptable.
There are a number of reasons why parents consider the physical punishment as the best form of discipline. Firstly, they usually think that when children are smacked for bad behaviour they will learn that every action has a reaction. Secondly, adults constantly want to have control over their children and let them know who is in charge by this obsolete method. Finally, parents often want to make sure that their children will not repeat the bad behavior again by being afraid of the consequences.
On the other hand, there are some strong arguments against smacking children.To begin with, physical violence is the worst solution to any problem; instead, there are other forms of discipline that produce positive results. Children learn a lot by watching and imitating adults. Parents should strive to be role models for children by behaving appropriately at all times. What is more, physical punishment could leave a severe trauma on children and they may behave even more inappropriately in the future.
To summarise, children are the future of our society and adults should raise them with tolerance, patience and love. Being strict does not necessarily involve physical violence. Therefore smacking children to discipline them should be completely forbidden and parents who still do it, must be severely penalised by the law.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-is-smacking-children-the-best-form-of-discipline
1357,Solar energy is becoming more and more popular as a source of household energy in many countries around the world. Why is this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy?,"A consistent increase in the popularity of solar energy as a means of providing household energy has been noticed in many countries around the world.
Many factors contribute to this gradual increase in the acceptance and acknowledgment of Solar Energy. The need to meet the ever growing requirements of energy supply is the main motivation behind pursuing the development of an alternative energy generation system. Another reason is the non-existence of any harmful by products of the solar power generation system, unlike all other types of energy generation systems.
There are several advantages of Solar Energy. Unlike other energy sources like coal and petroleum the source of solar energy the sunlight is non-perishable .The absence of any harmful impact on the environment and the ability to function in perfect harmony with the ecosystem makes it an ideal energy generation system. In addition to this the abundant supply of sunlight and the improved technology to tap into this energy source has immensely helped in the increase of its popularity.
However there are few problems associated with solar energy. The limited although improved technology dampens the drive to use it as a power source. Moreover there are various other factors such as the lack of a support system for repairs, replacement of malfunctioning devices in the domestic solar generation systems which are proving to be a major hindrance. Another issue is that the availability of sunlight is subject to many factors and there are many countries worldwide which do not receive any sunlight during certain parts of the year. Replying on such dynamic power source might handicap the users of the system in more than one way.
In conclusion I would like to emphasize on the need to overcome the technological limitations marring the growth of the solar generation system into a reliable energy supply system used throughout the world.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-solar-energy-is-becoming-more-and-more-popular
1358,"Some believe that young people should have a university education, because this will bring benefits to the society in the future. Others, however, think it will lead to graduate unemployment. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Education has become one of the most important aspects in the modern societies. Some people believe that university education is mandatory for the youth while others argue that university graduates have a higher percentage of unemployment. I believe that both opinions are partially correct as I will support my stand with valid arguments in this essay.
The world is now dependent on sophisticated technologies and supporters of higher education argue that in order to operate and utilize modern tools and technologies, we need more skilled and higher educated employees. In addition, it is not possible to develop new innovations and breakthroughs if the employees are not educated. Take, for example, companies working in communication industry require at least bachelor degree in engineering for technical jobs and in some cases the entry-level requirement is M.Sc. or PhD. Indeed, if the youth are university-graduates, they will have a better opportunity to get hired. Thus, it has become imperative that every person should have a university degree.
On the other hand, some people contend that university curriculum never educate students how to work in the real world, as they focus more on the theoretical side. Because of this, most university students do not have practical skills that match job market requirements. Consequently, unemployment rates of university-educated people are, in some cases, much higher than those of people with lower education levels. For instance, in Egypt, people who have a vocational training will have tremendous opportunities to work, while highly-educated people may suffer from unemployment. That clearly shows that the gap between the university education and the market needs can deter people from joining colleges in order to have higher number of employment opportunities. Hence, I believe that the education systems should be continuously upgraded and enhanced to minimize this gap and meet the market requirements.
To conclude, many employers insist on university education. Meanwhile, the lack of the practical knowledge in the current curriculums reduces the opportunity of fresh-graduates to get jobs. Therefore, I believe that continuous improvement of the education system would resolve this situation and encourage more people to get enrolled in universities.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-young-people-should-have-university-education
1359,Nowadays more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots. Why do you think it is happening? Is it a negative or positive development?,"Today, technology has become an essential part of our work and life so much so that there is a dramatic increase in the number of tasks performed by robots. In my perspective, there are several economic and sociological reasons behind this positive development.
Firstly, people’s lifestyle has become more dynamic and demanding. That means people need to study and work more to achieve their progressive objectives.  Consequently, people are relying more and more on technology to do the basic tasks such as house cleaning and food preparation. For example, the number of people in the USA who use cleaning robots such as ROMBA are rapidly increasing due to the abundant time savings. Hence, by using advanced technologies people can save time for working or studying and achieve their big goals.
Secondly, this demanding lifestyle has pushed people far from their families; which, in turn, afflicted their social connections due to the shortage of free time. Therefore, people are now employing robots to save time for their social life. For instance, people in Japan use robots to prepare their breakfast while they chat. Undoubtedly, that utilization of technology improves people’s social life significantly and invigorates their business networks. Thus, the usage of robots at  work and home enables people to save time and use it for other more fulfilling tasks.
To sum up, advanced technology has reached people’s work and homes. This great development makes their life more comfortable and stimulates them to focus on their goals while robots do their daily tasks. I believe that such improvement is crucial to enhance people’s well-being.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-robots-are-being-used-at-home-and-office
1360,"Some people think that politicians have the greatest influence on the world, while others believe that scientists are. Discuss both sides of view and give your opinion.","While some people argue that politicians have the utmost impact on the universe, I am of the opinion that scientists are the most influential people on earth. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in more detail.
To begin with, some people believe that politicians have the greatest impact on the planet. This is because they make laws, policies and regulations that can last forever and can directly affect our lives either positively or negatively. For example, it was not possible to reach the Paris agreement on climate change without the participation of politicians. As a result, countries from across the globe came together and agreed to reduce the global temperature by two degree Celsius by 2050 which will have a sustainable impact on our lives. So, this argument is understandable.
However, I maintain that scientists have the biggest impact on our planet. Without them it was not possible to make our lives more convenient. Because of them, there are now cures for different kinds of diseases, we can easily communicate with other people across the globe and we are able to know problems that are affecting our world such as the climate change. For instance, the invention of Penicillin which was invented in 1940s and was considered the greatest invention of all time, has saved millions of lives from dying and it is still very effective in fighting different kinds of infections. In addition, scientists are more popular and more trustworthy than politicians across the globe because it is commonly understood that while politicians work to benefit themselves, scientists are more concerned about our lives in general.
To sum up, while I understand the argument that politicians have the biggest impact on the world, I strongly believe that scientists are the ones who have the highest influence  on our planet. The facts that they have invented many useful things to the world and they are more popular and more honest than politicians are the reasons for my argument.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-are-politicians-more-influential-than-scientists

What do you think.,"Nowadays, people are increasingly purchasing more and more products that they do not necessarily want. This essay will provide reasons why this is happening and argue why it will have a negative effect on people and community in general.
To begin with, there are different reasons for people to purchase things that they do not need. Firstly, they are very rich and want to show their wealth by all means. This is because there might a race amongst rich people to show off how much money they have. For example, in Sudan, many rich people buy things that they might never use for staggering prices just because one of them bought it. As a result, they waste their money in obsolete and useless products. Furthermore, it might happen because of their ignorance of the kinds and uses of such products. So, there are different reasons for people to buy products that they do not need.
Unfortunately, this kind of habits will negatively affect people and community. They will haemorrhage huge amount of money each time they buy such products. This will consequently lead to increase rate of poverty amongst the population. In addition, such spending will result in the accumulation of waste products in neighbourhoods. This could happen because people might throw away these unneeded products. For instance, in 2016, it was reported that 25% of the waste products in Saudi Arabic were new and unused at all. As a result, the cost of removing such products from neighbourhoods will increase significantly.
To sum up, it is evident why people purchase such useless products. This trend will obviously have negative effects on people and community.",7,band-7-essay-sample-people-are-buying-useless-things

1364,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Nowadays, overpopulation is increasingly becoming problematic. Cities around the world are becoming very crowded and this is a serious problem. This essay will discuss the reasons why this is happening and put forward some solutions for this issue.
To begin with, there are two main causes of overcrowding in cities. Firstly, the concentration of public services such as hospitals and schools in cities. It is easier for people in cities to have access to such services than those in rural areas. For instance, approximately 90% of public services in Sudan are in cities. This clearly shows that people migrate to cities looking for these services. Another reason of overcrowding in cities is their vibrant and active lifestyle which attracts people from rural areas. Generally speaking, the easy access to public services and the fast pace of life in cities are the main reasons of overpopulation in cities.
On the other hand, the overcrowding in urban areas around the world can be addressed in two ways. First of all, governments must provide public services to people in the countries. The sick people instead of travelling to cities looking for treatment will be able to have access to doctors in their counties. Furthermore, governments must build new cities to decrease the size of population in overcrowded cities and metropolitan areas. For example, the Japanese government has successfully reduced the size of population in its big and crowded cities by 20% by building new cities. This clearly prove the effectiveness of such a measure in reducing the number of people in overcrowded cities across the globe.
To sum up, this essay discussed the reasons why cities are becoming overcrowded which in brief because of the concentration of public services in cities and the vibrancy of lifestyle in them. In addition, this essay offered two solutions for such a problem and these are providing public services in rural areas and constructing new urban cities.",7,band-7-essay-about-over-population-in-cities

All band score estimates are approximate.,"Some people believe that the only way to avoid air pollution is limiting the air traffic. I disagree with this view. In my opinion, restricting air traffic will not completely prevent the pollution. Also it can have negative effects on the nation’ economy.
To begin with, the main problem associated with aviation is the noise and gases emitted by the airlines. This pollution can be controlled to a certain extent by limiting the number of aeroplanes. But, it is almost impossible to prevent the pollution as the majority of the pollutants in the air do not come from the airlines. It may be due to other factors. For example, the increasing number of vehicles on the road or the human activity such as deforestation often causes more pollution than the air contamination due to flights. Therefore, it is evident that limiting air traffic is not the complete solution to deal with the air pollution.
What’s more, restricting aeroplanes to prevent pollution can have many serious consequences on the country. First of all, the tourism industry will be affected due to the less availability of the airlines for the international or domestic passengers. International imports and exports of goods will also be affected. As a result, the country will not experience financial growth. Therefore, I believe that the governments of the countries  will not take such a risk by limiting  the air transportation when there are other options available .
To conclude, it is evident that the idea of restricting the air traffic is not the best or workable solution for the problem of air pollution.

On one hand, there are jobs which require tremendous amount of experience and expertise, which workers gain over a period of time, and putting an end to their employment because of their age is just unfair to the knowledge and effort put in. For instance, researchers and scientists give away their entire life to their work, and letting them go just because of age is cruel, knowing that the society will benefit from their work. Similarly, teachers should also be allowed to impart their knowledge till the time they can, as in my opinion without which our progress will be much slower.
On the other hand, I would like to say that professions like army and police will extensively benefit from an early retirement programme, because of their intense physical strength and schedules required in order to fulfill their duties. Moreover, an early retirement will give them a chance to be with their families which otherwise becomes impossible for them, due to the postings at non family stations. For example, in most of the western countries there is an age limit before which one should complete the mandatory defence tenure.

1368,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"These days famous people are often known for their glamour and abundance of money they have instead of their attainments. Some people believe that celebrities’ lifestyles can be bad models to teenagers. I partially agree with this view. I believe that this is not always true and young people should be responsible for their own behaviour.
To begin with, media sometimes give more attention to the personal lives of well known people such as politicians and film stars in order to attract the young viewers. Majority of the teenagers are not mature enough to choose what is right and wrong. They tend to just blindly follow what they see on the television or imitate their heroes. In this way, celebrities who are supposed to be the role models of the society mislead their young fans.
On the other hand, many teenagers live without being negatively influenced by the famous people. They only admire the professional side and the positive aspects of their traits. These people do not consider the celebrities’ glamour and wealth even though they are aware of these.
For that reason, this group of youngsters does not want to completely copy the celebrity life. I believe that they might be trained in that way from their childhood to filter out the right things from others. Apart from that, famous personalities are just human beings. They can be attracted to wealth and glamour world. We cannot blame them for these shortcomings. It is the responsibility of young people to choose the good and discard the bad.

1369,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Many people get into debt due to the careless and improper use of credit cards.Therefore, some people believe that banks should ensure the customer’s ability pay off their debt before issuing them credit cards. I partially agree with this assertion. I believe that the financial stability of individuals can change any time. So ensuring the proper use of credit cards is beyond the control of banks.
To begin with, people consider credit cards as a means to improve lifestyles or to borrow money for business. They tend to borrow a large amount of money than they actually are supposed to as the credit cards are easy to use and readily acceptable in so many places.Unfortunately, some people cannot pay back the debts and get into huge financial trouble. Banks usually won’t issue credit cards if they are not completely satisfied with the finances of the people.They often check the income level and the loan history of individuals and explain the burdensome consequences that can happen to the customers before issuing a credit card. However, some people carelessly use credit cards and get into permanent debts. So it is unfair to blame the bank for the credit card holder’s mistakes
However, we have to acknowledge the fact that financial situation of anyone can change any time. It cannot be predicted. Usually credit card holders are rich. But at some point they may not be able to pay back the borrowed money due to the challenges in their finances. In this case bank’s calculations can be wrong. As a result, people go into debts. I believe it might be helpful if the bank reminds their customers through text messages or emails when they are overusing the credit cards. It discourages people from further use. Apart from that customers should be able to use their credit cards wisely for their financial well being.
To conclude, it is important for the banks to verify the individual’s ability to pay back debits before giving them credit cards. However, I believe citizens are also equally responsible and use their cards carefully to protect themselves from debt.",7,band-7-ielts-essay-sample-bank-should-check-the-finances-of-a-person-before-issuing-credit-cards-to-them
1370,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"With the advent of information technology social networking websites have become immensely popular for making friends online. Some people consider them as an inappropriate means of making friends where as for others chat rooms and social sites are most convenient way of making new friends. In my opinion, making friends online carry unnecessary risks. So it is essential to be careful before indulging in such practices. In this easy, I shall underpin my belief with relevant examples and ideas.
To begin with, crime is rife among youngsters these days, and is the most prevailing and disturbing aspect of the society. According to a recent Cambridge survey cyber crime is the most common offense among teenagers nowadays and is increasing rapidly at an alarming rate.
Cyber criminals follow a typical pattern to trap an individual. This begins with befriending innocent people on the internet. The next step is to gain their trust and confidence. Once a victim is trapped, offenders very cleverly ask them to share their personal details so that they can misuse that data. Hackers use that personal information for the purpose of ransom or sometimes for other crimes such as sexual assault. Besides this, offenders do not disclose their true identity and post fake information about themselves on websites. As a result they manage to get off unscathed.
To conclude, I firmly believe that making friends online with total strangers is a mistake as it can compromise our safety and privacy. Care should be taken while revealing personal information online.

1371,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"There is no denying the fact that the internet has become a boon which provides people access to everything around them. Some people argue that the misuse of the internet can adversely affect humans. However, I believe that access to so much information via the internet is beneficial to everyone although it can create some problems if it is used improperly.
On the one hand, we are able to find answers to simple questions as well as complex queries within a second by browsing the internet. This definitely benefits every person around the world.  This technological advancement allows people to gain more information and knowledge on the happenings around the world in a fraction of a second. Moreover, access to the internet is enormously advantageous for students in completing assignments as well as to know the world better. For example, e-tuitions which enhance the academic performance of students are a product of the internet and are gaining popularity. The internet has also made online shopping, net banking, e-learning and social networking possible. These have made the life of people easier and more comfortable.
On the other hand, the misuse of the internet can adversely harm the society as well as the individual. For example, someone can learn the steps of bomb making from the internet and create a bomb and cause destruction. Moreover, many terrorist groups have sites online to attract youngsters to work against their country. Cyber crime, another byproduct of the internet, is also on the rise.  Worse still, today’s children have access to the internet from an early age and often stumble upon content that is inappropriate for their age. This can affect their behaviour.
In conclusion, I believe that people have immensely benefited from the internet in many ways. Its inappropriate usage can have detrimental effects on the individual as well as the society; however, parental supervision and strict laws will take care of these problems.",7,band-7-essay-sample-use-and-abuse-of-the-internet
1372,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Most individuals are of the view that a good amount of wealth results into happiness, while some believe that being very rich has its own curse. In my opinion, I completely agree that a lot of money always brings with itself many unforeseen problems as well.
Money and it’s vicious power to attract humans to fulfill their various wishes, at any cost, has always been debated. Earning sufficient money for one’s basic needs and amenities, as well as to fulfill their family obligations and provide them with suitable comforts of a modern life are very much justifiable. However, the issue arises when more wealth leads to a feeling of greed and a sense of invincibility amongst family and peers. As a result, a sense of suspicion, envy and jealousy creeps in within social relationships and takes a heavy toll on family matters as well. For instance, the recent war of words in public between Ambani brothers due to differences of opinion, for sharing and taking control of the vast business empire left over by their father. Such instances, due to fear of personal financial loss lead to permanent damage of relationships and split between families.
Secondly, gaining more and more financial clout and enjoying the material luxuries the world has to offer, comes with its own set of sacrificies. Many high-earning corporate CEO’s and senior level management at most of these companies struggle with their daily hectic work schedules and get overburdened by the responsibilities, with the only aim of maximising the bottom line at all cost. This results in a serious issue of not being able to devote enough time to their family and friends, as well as a deterioration in their physical and mental well-being, and later at times leading to life-threatening diseases. A recent survey by Times showed that more than 40 percent of top executives in India are suffering from high-blood pressure and stress related issues.
In conclusion, I believe that having too much money not only leads to issues in personal and family relationships, but also deprives one of a healthy and peaceful way of life that can be enjoyed with sufficient money.",7,band-7-essay-sample-does-money-bring-happiness
1373,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"In the recent years , there has been an intense debate in all judicial systems across the world over the fact that punishments should commensurate crime .Many people reckon that juveniles committing serious crimes should be penalized in the same way as adults . I strongly support that for heinous and serious crimes even the youngsters should be prosecuted in the same way as adult offenders .
To start with , the most compelling reason for support is that serious punishment for serious crime will deter them and other young criminals from offences . Serious crimes like murder, outraging the modesty of females, child molestation and anti-national activities are so severe, that even if performed by teenagers, deserve rigorous action so that it can serve as an example not only for them but also for other youths with criminal bent of mind. Lighter penalty, like sending them to reform-house, in such grievous acts will propagate crime while stringent action will prevent them from even planning the crime . For instance, a report published in Criminal Survey, a famous Law journal in 2011 revealed that 40 percent of juvenile delinquents repeat the crime when send to reform houses as against only 10 percent flouting laws when no special privilege is being given on the basis of age .
Moreover , punishment proportionate to crime gives a sense of justice for the bereaved family. Most of the grief- stricken families, who have lost their near and dear ones, hope that offenders should be punished in a similar way. Thus, it brings confidence among them regarding the unbiased nature of judicial system.
To conclude, on the basis of above arguments, I reiterate my view that heinous crimes should be severely punished despite of the age of the criminal.",7,band-7-essay-sample-juveniles-committing-serious-crimes-should-be-punished-in-the-same-way-as-adults
1374,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"Museums and monuments showcase the history ,culture and tradition of any country. Most of such places , nowadays , attract tourists while the footfall of local inhabitants is meager. There are numerous reasons for such a trend and simple measures taken by the government can increase the attendance of local people .
To begin with , local people shun museums and historical sites because the experience to visiting such places is often monotonous. Most of the monuments are standing for centuries and museums are usually not regularly updated. Therefore, although they are always in tourist’s itinerary on account of new experience but for natives regular visits is quite often boring.
Another reason for infrequent visits by the locals is the cost. Most of the museums and historical places have entry fees which is often an issue in developing countries where majority earn just enough money to make the ends meet. Finally, most governments are busy focusing on science and technology which will bring bright future but this is being done at the cost of neglecting our glorious past. Due to this biased behavior by the authorities, people are loosing interest in museums and archaeological sites.
There are multiple simple solutions which can be taken by government to rekindle the interest. One way could be organizing regular events like exhibitions, inter – cultural events and light shows which can provide natives a varied experience every time they visit the site. Another step could be scrapping the entry fees so that everyone can visit them. Finally , the local authorities should aggressively advertise museums and monuments so that it engross the locals.

1375,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"It is often argued that kids of employed couples get most appropriate support from play schools or day care centres, whilst others disagree and think grandparents are the best caretakers to support young ones. This essay agrees with the argument that the best option to guard the kids who miss their parents due to employment. This essay will discuss both the perspectives.
On the one hand, parents take care of their grandchildren solely due to the factor of love and affection. Also, more than just caretakers, they help the babies to learn and enjoy their time in a comfortable and merry way. Moreover, the blood relationship help better bonding and create an overall healthy atmosphere , which in turn foster better growth and character formation. For Instance, a recent research found that babies learn 37 percentage faster from parent or Grandparents. For this reason, my view is that grandparents are better caretakers than institutions who run baby care centres for monetary benefits.
On the other hand, playschools offer services on monetary basis and point of view of such institutions are not the wellbeing of the babies. As money is the motivating factor, day care centres usually accommodate 20 to 25 kids at a time and that makes it difficult to concentrate on all in an attentive fashion. Furthermore, for babies pre-school age is crucial for learning and grasping things from elders, which the care centres may ignore or fail to address. For example, a recent satisfaction survey on pre-schools in UK shows that 56 percentage of parents are dissatisfied with the learning and support provided by such centres.
To conclude, it is highly necessary to understand and acknowledge the needs of young ones in more passionate way like a grandparent does than substituting them or relying on professional institutions to fulfill it.",7,band-7-essay-sample-grandparents-vs-day-care-centres

While doing so, they explore different cultures of the people and could even choose where they want to live in the future.
One of the main reasons why people travel is their job. Due to globalization, many companies want their employees to travel different locations to understand the country’s specific requirements of their business. Once they travel, they understand the business needs of the specific country and design systems for the local markets. People also travel for leisure. They want to enjoy their holidays and book a preplanned guided tour to a tourist destination like Mauritius and Hawai. Some countries offer great deals during the peak summer period to encourage people travel to their location.
Travelling to different places could help people live their dreamed life. Commuting to various locations gives people an opportunity to visit different places and understand a variety of cultures. This could help them analyse how people live in different locations. As a result, people could get much impressed with a particular country or location. They would like to relocate permanently to that location and could plan to live there in the future. By doing so, they would attain utmost satisfaction and could lead their life as per their aspirations.

1381,The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.,"With the alarming rise in crime rate, it is believed by some people that crimes should be categorised and accordingly punishments be pre-decided.  However, other people are of the opinion that all surrounding factors of committing a crime should be well considered before punishing the criminal.
If the matter is viewed objectively, it is true that fixed punishments will take away a lot of wrong practices  from the judicial system. The judgements will be impartial, people will witness rather quick and fair decisions. For instance, many cases have been brought up by media where it is observed that the judge’s religious or personal beliefs impacted the severity of the punishments. Sometimes the punishments are too severe, and sometimes too liberal. Categorising and pre-deciding the punishments will make the system fair and impartial to a large extent.
On the contrary, it is not just the responsibility of the judicial system to punish the criminals but to also help control the crime rates  to begin with. It is extremely crucial for the judicial system to understand the underlying cause that led to the crime in the first place. For instance, a crime involving murder for greed of money is different from the murder committed in an attempt to save oneself from getting killed. Evaluating the prevailing circumstances, the psychological health of the criminal, in his or her motivation behind the crime are all factors that cannot be marginalised.
With all the different aspects mentioned above, I think that pre-deciding the punishments for a crime is not the most practical solution. It is more important to comprehend overall situation and let the judge analyse and decide upon a punishment that instils fear in the criminal for committing a crime again but at the same time does not prohibit them to live a normal life after completing their punishment.",7,band-7-essay-sample-there-should-be-fixed-punishments-for-each-crime
1382,The following is an essay submitted by one of our users.,"Some people argue that exploring space involves too much investment and time, while others think it is required for mankind’s survival. In this essay, I will discuss both views and express my opinion.
Space research requires huge amounts of money which can be invested for meeting the basic needs of the people. Countries like Somalia are unable to fulfill the basic needs of their citizens. Food, clothing and shelter form a primary need for the mankind and these should take precedence before any other development. Therefore, it is important to satisfy the primitive needs before spending money on exploration of universe. Developed countries should help the poor countries to build these amenities instead of spending on space.
On the other hand, it also seems important to research the planets and the universe. If we had not done enough research on space, we would not have found about the ozone depletion and annual rise in earth’s temperature. Because of this research we had the opportunity to learn more about the planet we live in, and plan to safeguard the Earth from unexpected disasters. Also, space research has helped us to understand the nature and the precautions we should take for natural calamities.

Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In recent years, there has been a surge in number of students going abroad for higher education. Few people think that moving abroad to pursue higher studies is advantageous, while others argue that there are significant drawbacks. In this essay, we I look into both sides of the argument and provide my support to the former view.
It is a general trend that students consider well developed countries, while they make plans for higher education. I think this comes with numerous advantages. Not only the quality of education is better, but also future career prospects post-graduation are lucrative. For Instance, I moved to USA to pursue my master’s degree and was very impressed with the quality of education, use of modern and effective course delivery techniques, knowledge of teaching staff and so on so forth. Further, good quality education was a key to help me land a job that best suites my career goals. Though the advantages mentioned here look convincing, we need to ponder on the disadvantages.
Majority of the students, who travel abroad for higher education, tend to travel alone leaving behind their loved ones. This can be morally challenging and may lead to depression. In addition, many students go through culture shock and find it difficult to acclimatize to new culture .Furthermore, as discussed earlier that quality of education is better, but quality always goes hand in hand with cost for few this can be really challenging and stressful. For example, mybrother had to go through periods of intense stress to get his higher education loan paid off, but thankfully he was able to pay it all has he secured a decent job. In light of the above mentioned aspects, we can see why some people think pursuing higher education abroad is not all advantageous.

1391,The following is an essay submitted by one of our readers. It may contain spelling or grammar mistakes. All band score estimates are approximate.,"Over the past decade, the healthy lifestyles have become one of the pillars in maintaining and transforming modern societies. Some have opined that authorities should apply restricted measures to encourage individuals to follow appropriate lifestyle, while others see it as an individual responsibility to control their habits and follow those programs. This essay will discuss both point of views.
Government authorities such as ministry of public health, promote the deployment of such programs. However, measuring the results is essential in shaping new plans and bridging the gaps. Governments are required to allocate the required budget based on the results achieved. For example, following such programs will reduce the number of patients which in turn will make a significant reduction in the required medical care budget. Another factor why government should apply those measures is its ability to launch and establish health clubs in a large number of cities in addition to the media campaigns that does a great deal of influences on the audience. For example, government can provide healthy food recipes along with the exercises that really help change people style of living. Those examples support the view point of government applying the measures.
On the other hand, Individuals are the main factor of following and maintaining their lifestyle healthy. Without their determination, all government efforts would fail. Measures cannot be followed if the person is not convinced with its advantages. For example, a determined person, who is keen to apply that lifestyle, will find the time throughout the day to apply it. Some fitness videos are now available on the internet to maintain your physical fitness within 15 minutes a day. He will be following a healthy meals to get better results for his own sake. Changing those eating habits will dramatically enhance his health and reduce the diseases.
To conclude, it is now clear that both Government and individuals are sharing the responsibilities of maintaining healthy lifestyle. In my opinion, it is obviously required to engage and stimulate individuals towards such programs. Such engagement cannot be done without the government support.

Please note that all band score estimates are appropriate.,"With the growing population in many countries and the increasing number of people leaving rural areas in search for a better life, the housing crisis is affecting some of the biggest cities. That is because the space is not enough to accommodate everyone anymore. Land currently preserved by national parks may be on their last days as some local governments are willing to reassign these areas for residential development. I strongly believe that park areas should be preserved as long as possible for the sake of quality of life in the cities. Firstly, in this essay I will address the importance of green areas on big metropolises and then a possible solution for this problem.
Green areas in large cities play an important role on the quality of the air. The pollution made by cars, factories and the burning of fossil fuels in general is reduced by preservation parks inside the cities. This is extremely important for our health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that every city should have a minimum of 9 square meters of green space per person.
With the need for space growing without stop on the cities, the local government sees no option besides give up on some of the city’s park lands. A very good way to minimize the negative effects of this action is to create rooftop gardens. If most buildings had large beautiful gardens covering their rooftops, the problem of cities running out of green areas would be solved.
In conclusion, I believe that green areas should be protected against the real estate market. The WHO recognizes that a minimum of 9 square meters of green space per person is necessary to live a healthier life in the city. To turn this problem around, gardens should be created on the rooftops of the majority of the buildings.",7,band-7-essay-sample-park-land-should-be-used-for-housing

Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Some people support the rule 18 years as minimum age to start riding car; however other feel that this age limit should be increased to 25. This essay will discuss both the views and give a reasonable conclusion.
Firstly, people who argue that 18 is the perfect age to start driving a car is because they feel that most teenagers become biologicallymature at this age. Most countries have concluded through several scientific studiesthat juveniles can learn driving and overcome their road fear at early age like 18. Moreover, during this mature age they start going to college and need to have enough facilities like own transport to live an independent life. Hence, most countries allow to start driving at 18 years.
However, some people believe that minimum age limit to issue driving license should be increased to 25 years because they see driving as a serious affair. Most youngsters get carried away by passion to ride at high speed and lead to serious road accidents. For instance, in a country like India where roads are so shabby and easy to cause vehicle collision, speeding is a common factor for serious fatalities. Therefore, driving should be permitted at age of 25 to ensure safety of citizens.
In conclusion, I believe from the above discussed points that governments should continue to issue driving license at age of 18 because it is the perfect age to learn driving and teenagers need to have their own transport to enjoy life. However, their intention to drive furiously could be controlled by enforcing strict traffic laws and legislation in place.",7,band-7-essay-about-driving-age
1394,"Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Due to globalization, many countries are joining their hands with other countries to create win-win opportunities. The important factors for developments of poorer countries are enhancement in the area of health, education and trade. However, the governments of other richer countries should accept more responsibility to help the poorer countries in those areas. Nonetheless, in my opinion, this should not be at the expense of developments of their own countries.
It is inevitable fact that developed countries spend millions of dollars for research in different areas. However, this money can be spend for development of under developed and developing countries. The governments of richer countries can help to poorer nations in the areas of health, education, trade etc. by providing aid for different purposes. They can enhance public health by providing advance medical facilities. Moreover, they should always embrace students in their countries by providing them higher education and liberalizing visa process. This would help their own countries as well. It may bring cultural diversity and a sense of tolerance among the people of their own countries. For example, the US government provides funds for aids patients in Uganda which is really helpful for under developed country like Uganda.
Nevertheless, richer countries should not provide funds at the expense of development of their own nations. The governments should appropriately estimate budget required for their own countries and then after only excess funds can be allocated for helping the poorer nations.
In conclusion, the governments of richer nations should help poorer nations for development and improvement in different areas provided that they have excess funds and resources available to them.

1395,In the recent years children are forced to study even in their leisure time. Is this a good practice? Do you agree or disagree?,"Throughout the human history education has been considered as one of the key components of success in life. However, everything is good in balance and education is not an exception. Thus, I disagree with the belief that pushing kids to study at their spare time would be extremely beneficial for them.
Some philosophers say that education kills imagination. When a person starts gathering new information from different books and lectures, they use a material that has already been explored by someone else. As we know, childhood tend to be one of the most adventurous moments when everything is new and unexplained. If kids are forced to spend all of their time on studies, they will not have enough time for explorations.
In addition, there are numerous facts that prove that a human brain is capable of memorizing a certain amount of information, when the limit is reached people stop understanding and memorizing any new material. Therefore, it is essential to give our brain a rest from time to time in order to maintain the ability to receive and analyse new information. Otherwise, any education will be simply a waste of time and money.
To recapitulate, it is necessary to say that childhood is a unique and unforgettable moment of our lives. Most importantly, by overfilling it with books, studies, and schools parents do not help their kids to become future great philosophers and thinkers. On the contrary, they prevent them from developing a creative mindset that is so important in fields such as entrepreneurship, art, and science.",7,band-7-essay-children-are-forced-to-study-even-in-their-leisure-time
1396,In some countries an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Imposing a higher tax on fast food only has a marginal impact on preventing people from eating too much junk food. For ordinary people, the low price of fast food is not the primary reason for them to choose this kind of food. Most of them prefer fast food instead of healthy food just because they put convenience on a higher priority than health. Therefore, although an increment on tax will result in a higher price, many consumers may still choose fast food. On the other hand, some people choose fast food because they do not have alternatives. Healthy food, such as organic food, usually have a higher price which might not be affordable for those people. Therefore, if the price of fast food goes higher, there will be much fewer choices of foods for them, which will eventually lead them to a harder life.
Compared with increasing tax, making healthy food more convenient and more affordable to citizens might be a better solution for government. Exerting an excessive amount of Interference in the market could cause damage to the local economy. The government, therefore, should try to avoid such risky behaviour. Instead, they can encourage the consumption of healthy food. For example, the commercial cultivation of organic foods can be facilitated so that consumers can buy healthy foods with lower price. Additionally, spending the budget on promoting a healthy lifestyle through education and training to consumers is another practical solution for the problem caused by fast food.
In conclusion, to cope with the health issue caused by an excessive consumption of fast food, the government should focus on advertising the healthy lifestyle to the citizen, rather than simply charging a higher tax on fast food.",7,band-7-essay-about-increasing-tax-on-fast-foods
1397,Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and traditions. Others disagree and say that the host country should welcome cultural differences.,"With the growth of technology in the travel industry, travelling to other countries has increased at rapid speed. Countries have disparate set of customs and interpretation of behaviour. The visitors should be allowed to follow their own customs and behaviour but they must be wary of offending local customs and beliefs. In my opinion, we should develop world as global village to create unity in diversity.
The focal point of humanity should be moral values which are common in all regions rather than customs and behaviors which are diverse in different regions. If a host country cannot entertain the culture of visitors then its participation with other countries in economic, financial and other activities will be hampered. South Asian country India is the best example of unity in diversity. There people from all the religions live peacefully and even visitors from other countries can follow their own culture. In my opinion, it is the moral responsibility of visitors to respect important beliefs and customs of their host country.
Different countries could have different interpretation of the same practice. It is very much important for the visitors to know some practices the places they visit so that they don’t hurt sentiments or misinterpret behaviour of local people. A good example of cultural differences is the eating habits in India. In India people always prefer to eat with their hands which is considered as inferior in some western countries. Therefore, if a western person is visiting India, he must be aware of this and not feel offended.
In conclusion, we can say that culture is basically a set of rules followed by people which may vary in different countries. Furthermore cultural practices can’t be used as a tool to measure morality or character of a person. In my opinion, host nations should understand that visitors may have different cultures. Visitors too must be wary of offending local customs and traditions.",7,band-7-5-essay-sample-visitors-should-follow-local-customs
1398,Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Due to globalization, more and more people are now travelling to other countries for many purposes such as higher studies, business, medical treatment, immigration etc. Some people think that host culture should be followed by visitors of other countries. On the other hand, some people argue that it is imperative that cultural diversity is given importance by the host country. In my opinion, the host country should always embrace disparate cultures from all over the world rather than imposing their culture on them.
There is a wide range of advantages of following diverse culture. Firstly, when there is a cosmopolitan environment in the country, then it develops a sense of tolerance in the local people. This would be helpful to them when they visit other country. Moreover, Diversity in culture always brings novelties. People can experience new traditions and customs with wide range of differences in food, languages, clothes, rituals, etc. This can be exemplified by growth rate and development in US and European countries. They always welcome cultural differences. Furthermore, cultural diversity brings unity and a feeling of brotherhood among the people.
Although a country can be benefited by cultural diversity, local customs and traditions should be given equal importance as well. When People from other countries simultaneously follow local culture then it may helpful to them in bridging the gap of discrimination. Everybody will be given equal chance to grow and develop in the country.
To conclude, host country should always welcome diverse people with diverse culture from all over the world. It should also ensure that local culture is not eradicated.",7,band-7-essay-sample-travelers-should-follow-local-customs
1399,More and more people are now living alone. Is this a positive or negative development?,"In many parts of the world, people prefer living alone more than before. I believe this phenomenon is a negative trend due to many reasons which I will discuss in this essay.
People who are living alone are more vulnerable to crimes. Living alone might encourage criminals to break into their house and steal valuable items or even kill the person if he or she tries to stop them. This happens because it is easy to threaten a guy than a group of people. People who are living alone have no one to help them when there is an emergency. For instance, a survey in Brazil found that 70% of robberies in Rio de Janeiro were committed in houses of people who live alone.
Living in a house alone might cause loneliness. When a person lives at a separate place, he or she will not be able to interact with people for more than 8 hours a day at workplaces or classes because friends prefer to get together on weekends, not on weekdays. That’s why people who live alone would feel lonely and not like their peers who live with friends or family. Not to mention that loneliness might lead to an incurable psychological illness. To illustrate, the Guardian revealed that 80% of the visitors of psychiatric hospitals in the UK are suffering from loneliness because they are living alone.
To conclude, living alone is a negative development since people who live alone would be vulnerable to crimes, and it might let them feel lonely as well.",7,band-7-essay-sample-positive-and-negative-effects-of-living-alone
1400,Essay topic,"Owning to the realisation of the importance of health, people have become increasingly concerned about the negative impact of modernism on their physical and mental health. In this essay, I would like to explore the downside of modernism on our health and will also provide some measures to overcome them.
It is obvious that there are numerous demerits of modernisation especially on our health. To start with, one of the negative aspects of modernism is a change in eating habits. Nowadays, most of the people prefer fast food and processed food which are less nutritious with high fat and salt content, instead of home cooked and organic food. As a result, people have become overweight which is one of the risk factors for heart disease, hypertension and high cholesterol.
Another disadvantage of modernism is encouraging people to do less exercise. For instance, most people choose to use lift or escalator rather than staircases, drive rather than walk and enjoy doing indoor rather than outdoor activities. It is undeniable that these modern behaviours and lifestyles are contributing to our ill health. Last but not least, consumerism and materialism which are the outcome of modernism make people workaholics and provide unnecessary physical and mental stress. Therefore, many people have had nervous breakdowns.
Many actions can be taken to combat the negative effects of modernism. The best way to do this is educating people on how to live a healthy life through media by the government .There should be a ban on the advertisement of fast food and the consumer should be fully informed about the danger of fast food with clear instruction on the packaging.
Moreover, the government should encourage people to walk which is not only a healthier choice but also environmental friendly than driving, by constructing pedestrian and walking paths and increasing tax for car users. Finally, the government should implement rules and regulations to fix working hours in order to avoid overwork .This would give people more time to rest and exercise.
To conclude, modernism can be very distressing for one’s health and both governments and individuals should take responsibility to lessen these effects.",7,band-7-essay-sample-about-the-adverse-effects-of-modernism
1401,Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Sample essay
Some argue that competitive attitude in children should be facilitated, while others claim that learning them how to co-operate with their peers would make them better adults. In my view, this is a sensitive issue to discuss, but I would prefer to have a competitive and a cooperative child, as the combination of these two characters will add to the child significantly.
Firstly, competing with your class mates will enhance your performance intillectually and physically. For example, having a class of students full of motivation, and the desire to score full marks, will lead to a better atmosphere in the class, and increases the level of education. Similarly, when it comes to sports, competitive attitude is crucial to reach fame and success.
On the other hand, raising children with the spirit of co-operation and giving a hand to the needy ones will create a society full of charity. Also, it will decrease number of crimes in that society. Teaching children how to deal with poor, injured, and handicapped people is an act of humanity. Conversely, a society full of selfish, greedy, and power-loving individuals will lead to moral collapse and a lot of social problems.
Therefore, in my point of view, it is better to teach our children how to treat others rightly. Moreover, raising a young competitive generation will develop the society, and increase level of literacy. Eventually, these two results will yield economic growth, and financial benefits.
In conclusion, children should be taught how to be successful in their lives. Raising children with good characters like helping others, and competing with others in different fields will put them on the right path for success and prosperity.

1402,What are the advantages and disadvantages of online communication?,"We are living in the 21st century. There are many people who use online communication tools like Facebook, Gmail and Yahoo. Online communication is becoming more and more popular. It has many advantages and disadvantages.
Nowadays people like online communication because there are many advantages. The rates are cheap. It uses modern technology. You can just fire up Skype or another communication app on your laptop and do video chat. These days we can communicate with our relatives through email which reach the recipient immediately. We can also send pictures and videos online. They help to maintain our relationships.
Online video chatting also helps us to interact with new people and make new friends. For example, my younger brother who lives in the US regularly sends us photos through email. We also do video chat over Skype. Though we are living in different countries we stay in constant touch.
Some people, however, say that online communication is not good enough. In their opinion, there are many disadvantages to it. For example, some people use fake identities online for cheating others. They make friends with innocent people and often cheat them. There are also people who hack online apps. They steal passwords and other information. Hackers create a lot of problems all over the world.
To conclude, online communication has both advantages and disadvantages. However, in my opinion, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I feel that people should not misuse this communication tool. In addition, the government needs to form laws to protect the privacy of people engaging in online communication.",7,band-7-essay-sample-2
1403,"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be compulsory part of high school programmes (for example working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching to younger children).
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Unpaid community service such as working for a philanthropic organization or helping old people must be an integral part of high school education. The schools are not a place for learning math or physics only. They should teach real life skills also. Therefore I strongly believe that unpaid community services should be added to school programs. Children who go to high school should learn to help old people without expecting anything in return.
In my opinion, everyone needs to learn to help others without expecting anything in return. This might be difficult in the beginning, but they will learn this skill over time. For example, teaching sports to younger children or helping old people will become interesting activities for them after they see the other person’s happiness. By engaging in these activities from such a young age, they will learn to take care of people who need their help. For example, if they become an engineer, they will readily help an engineering student in internship.
Working for a charity also gives students an opportunity to communicate with other people. This will improve their communication skills. Good communication skills are essential for success in life. For instance, by working for a charity, they start to communicate with people that they don’t know. This situation improves their communication skills. The other important point is that they will be a part of a group and learn to work in a group.
In conclusion, unpaid community service must be an important part of high school education and I strongly believe that these services must be compulsory and with these services, students learn crucial life skills in their early life.",7,band-7-essay-sample-about-compulsory-community-service-for-high-school-students
1404,Since the 18th century technological advances have replaced people in the workplace. With today’s technology this process is happening at a greater rate. Technology is increasingly responsible for unemployment.,"Modern technology helps people live a lot easier, although it has a number of disadvantages. The fantasy vision of robots controlling major parts of human lives is slowly becoming a reality. Unemployed people blame the government for allowing this situation to spiral out of control but opinions are divided.
Unemployment in 21th century is far higher than what it was a couple of decades ago. Inventors work really hard to develop new machines and robots. The trend of saving money on labour has dramatically increased and this can be noticed on a daily basis. People use all of the inventions every day, but they are starting to see the downsides of machines as well. New self-checkout machines in most supermarkets have replaced over 50 percent of old fashion cashiers. In some countries the train drivers has been replaced by self-driving trains. Now many of us are withdrawing money through cash machines. Looking at this trend one might assume that technology has increased the number of people without jobs. However, it is not quite true.
The machines have considerably improved our standard of life. They haven’t killed jobs. Actually, it is safe to claim that the new technologies have created new professions. Every machine requires regular service and repairs, so engineers are in high demand. Most of the new technologies need to be constantly improved by inventors. This gives new career opportunities for the youngsters, and university teachers.  Fewer labourers means less costs and lower final product price.
The number of advantages is far higher than disadvantages. Using all of the inventions and blaming them for the loss of jobs is hypocrisy. Laziness is the major problem, and the increase in machine usage is only a ridiculous excuse.",7,band-7-essay-sample-technology-is-responsible-for-unemployment
1405,"Modern technology, such as personal computers and the internet have made it possible for many people to do their work from home instead of going to an office every day.  What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of this situation?","Continuous advancement in technology is changing the way we define the workplace. With the fast paced internet and numerous networking techniques, employees opt to work from home rather than commuting to the office. In my opinion there are several advantages to this approach provided that we are able to solve a few challenges.
Firstly the work from home culture brings various monetary benefits to the employer. When an employer arranges a workplace for an individual, they have to bear the facilitation cost for him. Also when employees work from their home, the company does not have to make arrangements for their transport. Owing to this, the overall cost of running an office comes down.
Secondly, work from home enables employees to save time. This time can be utilized for office work or for the family. Additionally, all the employees can start their day at the same time and can be more productive.
Lastly, working from home saves valuable resources. Less commuting means less travel and less load on transport systems. There can be significant savings in terms of the fuel. Moreover, electronic media usage will result in less paper wastage. All this can help in reducing the overall carbon footprint.
On the contrary, not working from office may hamper the team harmony. It can also hamper the individual’s efficiency as they may not get instant support. However an efficient management can easily take care of these issues.
All in all, working from home brings in myriads of benefits to the society. Employers have already started realizing these advantages and in the future, we will surely have more organizations taking this route.

1406,This essay was written by one of our students and may contain spelling or grammar mistakes. All band score predictions are approximate.,"Today, in many organizations employees play an important role in decision making. Some people argue that this should be done only by the management, while others argue that employees should be a part of it. I will discuss both points of view and provide my opinion in the conclusion.
To begin with, managers have got wide experience and vast knowledge on different processes. If managers are not given importance of their role and responsibilities, then they would feel neglected. For instance, a manager knows how his/her team members can arrive at the best decision. This will be beneficial to stakeholders and employees. Likewise, many confidential documents are taken into consideration while making a decision, so employees should not be involved.
On the other hand, employees feel motivated and prefer to stay longer if they are a part of the decision making process. One of the reasons is that employees would be affected if a wrong decision is made, so if they are a part of it they can suggest some changes. For example, employees prefer a transparent environment and will have a better bond with their manager if they are allowed to make decisions. If employees are happy, the attrition rate of an organization will be low.
In conclusion, important decision making should be the responsibility of the management. However, if employees are taken into consideration, it will lead to a better work culture and more satisfied employees. Hence, in my opinion workers should be a part of the process along with their managers.

1407,Friends have greater influence on youngsters than parents and teachers. Discuss,"Children’s choice of their role model is a complicated process that is governed by circumstances and personality. However, I believe that choosing to follow like-minded friends’ influence has become the dominant trend amongst our children. Thus, I would have to concur with such an observation.
There is a significant generational gap between youngsters and their parents. Due to the recent revolution in communications, which is embodied in the invention of the internet, mobile phones and laptops, children are indirectly compelled to embrace a more globalized culture. Hence, parents find it difficult to communicate with their children as parents’ and their children’s background becomes too different from each other’s. For example, a parent born in the 50s will find it difficult to understand pop and rock culture that seems to be widespread amongst today’s youth.
Circumstances change individual’s choices. Parents tend to want their children to replicate their methods and approachs in life. However, children find difficulty in complying with their parents’ wish to adopt their methods as circumstances have changed. As a result, children would abandon his parents’ ways and follow other like-minded people’s ways. For example, parents usually would want their children to marry earlier. This is not applicable nowadays due to a more challenging economic situation.
In conclusion, children, compelled by circumstances and a more globalized environment, would have to abandon their parent’s advice as it has become no longer applicable in our world. This might seem like a negative thing, however, I believe that it is a peculiarity of a more independent generation that is able to think critically.

1408,"Some people think that managers alone should make decisions in the company, while others think that employees should be involved in the decision-making process too. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Today, many organizations involve employees in the decision making process. Some people argue that decisions should only be taken by the management, while others feel that employees too should be a part of the decision making process. Both views will be discussed in this essay before a conclusion is made.
Managers have got wide experience and vast knowledge. They are familiar with the way the business operates. They are also aware of the strengths and weaknesses of their employees. This knowledge and experience allows them to make decisions that are beneficial to the company, its stakeholders and employees. What’s more, while making important decisions several confidential documents are taken into consideration. Security can be an issue if all employees are involved in the process.
On the flip side, there are many reasons for employees to participate in the decision making process. They also want to feel that their contribution is valued. If the management involves them in the decision making process they will feel more confident of their roles. This will encourage them to stay longer with the same organization. Studies have shown that one way of reducing the attrition rate is to involve employees while important decisions are made. Wrong decisions taken by the management can have a negative impact on the employees. If they are part of the decision making process, they will be able to make appropriate suggestions. In addition, employees who work in a transparent environment tend to have a better bond with their manager.
To conclude, there are many reasons to involve employees in the decision making process. While the organization does not have to discuss all the confidential information with them, they should at least be allowed to make decisions that have an impact on them.",7,band-7-essay-sample-decisions-should-be-made-by-managers-and-not-employees
1409,People prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced ones. Why do you think this happens? Should the government support local film makers financially?,"There has always been an audience for international films. There are several reasons for this. However, the local film industry should not be allowed to suffer from the onslaught of international films. In my opinion, governments can play a crucial role in helping regional films succeed. In this essay, I will analyze the reasons behind the popularity of international films and suggest steps that the governments should take to help regional film makers.
The major reason behind the popularity of foreign films is the presence of internationally acclaimed directors and actors. International award functions like the Oscars and film festivals like the Cannes get wide media coverage all over the world. This has also contributed to the popularity of foreign films.
Technological advancements in foreign films are another reason for their mass appeal. Technology has taken entertainment to an altogether new level. Thanks to developments in the audio-visual technology, we can now watch animated kids’ movies, action movies and science fiction movies.
There are also period movies based on historic events like war and its impact on countries. Movies like Schindler’s List are an example of this. They are watched by people all over the world.
On the flip side, there is a different class of audience for regional films. Film industries in Japan, China and Scandinavia mainly produce films based on their culture. These films enjoy huge popularity in their countries.
In my opinion, the governments can play a vital role in helping the local film industry survive. For example, the governments can provide tax relief to movies based on local culture. They should also provide interest free loans to regional film makers. In addition, awards should be instituted to honor such films. In the absence of support from the local government, the regional film industry will not be able to survive. I firmly believe that governments that want to protect their culture and legacy will not allow that to happen.",7,ielts-band-7-sample-essay-should-governments-help-the-local-film-industry
1410,Money management skills should be taught at schools. Do you agree or disagree?,"Finance is the art of managing money. Since virtually all businesses rely basically on their personnel’s ability to manage money, many experts believe that finance and money management are cornerstones for one’s success. Therefore, I have a firm conviction that finance should be taught at schools.
Money management is an essential skill for one’s success. Therefore, many people advocate for the integration of finance education in school curriculum. They believe that when a child acquires such skills, he is likely to be a wise spender and hence a successful individual. In addition to being an academic course, financial education can breed values, within students, such as self-discipline, confidence and an unprecedented desire for success.
Hence, not only does financial education pave the way for success, but also it instills values that constitute key ingredients of a sound character.
Instilling wise spending in the society can impact positively on the economy of a nation. This, however, can be done only at schools, where skills and knowledge are injected into the society. When a child realizes the importance of money, he will plan wisely for his retirement. Thus, ultimately, this would relieve the government of the burden of elderly people who are off the social security’s list of beneficiaries.
In conclusion, financial education is important for both –the individual and the society. Its effects echoes loudly in the society and secures a nation from a turbulent future. Also, financial education instills important values and morals into the society through individuals that complement a prosperous society.",7,ielts-band-7-5-essay-samples-money-management-skills-should-be-taught-at-schools
1411,Young people are getting more influenced by their friends than their parents and teachers. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is widely accepted that a teenager’s personality is more related to that of his peers than to his parents or teachers. In my opinion, this is an accurate proposition because at this age people spend more time and develop more intimate relationships with their friends.
At a young age people tend to spend most of their time with friends and colleagues – for leisure, academic or work related activities. Therefore, they are constantly exposed to certain modes of thinking adopted by people they are surrounded by. According to neuroscientists, this helps in creating neuro-associations  with regards to certain beliefs that teenagers then accept as their own. In fact, life coaches, like Tony Robins, has stressed the fact that in order for us to change we need to change the people we hang out with.  In addition, the time spent with friends create peer pressure, which encourages people to adjust their beliefs to “fit-in” in their social groups.
Furthermore, teenagers often develop a closer relationship with others of similar age or status. First, they are able to relate to these people who are under similar circumstances. They do not feel intimidated by then and hence they are willing to accept their views. Second, they feel the need to maintain close bonds with those in their social realm. Therefore, they exert additional effort to understand their friends’ mentality, which strengthens their friendship and hence their influence towards one another.
In short, on grounds of the time spent with friends and the close relationship developed , I can confidently say that teenagers are more influenced by their friends than by their parents and teachers.",7,ielts-band-7-essay-sample-young-people-are-getting-more-infleuenced-by-their-friends

All band score predictions are approximate:,"Some people think that by being highly dependent on digital devices, young people are losing their reading and writing skills. I beg to differ! In my opinion, people get to read and write more by using these devices and “practice makes perfect!”
The digital world has made people to become more interconnected. Within minutes, one is able to send a handful of messages. This encourages people to write more to avoid wasting time on phone calls or face-to-face meetings. In fact, the diverse types of writing that we make can improve different aspects of our writing. For example, when we text our friends, we use informal language such as using contractions. However, we use a more formal tone when messaging our manager.
Similarly, digitized data enhances our reading skills. Day in and day out, we are bombarded by multitude of information in text form.  Thanks to social media, people would share anything interesting with everyone they know, and it would cost them almost nothing. Hence, most people prefer to read their cluttered inboxes or social media messages during any waiting time such as commuting or standing in a queue. Although they may not realize it, this time is actually being invested by strengthening many soft skills such as reading.

Online shopping has caught the fancy of consumers. The trend shows that internet based online shopping is going to surpass traditional shopping by the end of this financial year. Though there are many advantages of online shopping, observers feel that traditional way of shopping also has its advantages and it cannot be replaced by online shopping.
Online shopping started at the end of nineties. But the premature bubble of dotcom boom burst in 1999. Industry learned from its mistakes and the new generation was more equipped with new ideas which led to success. Flipkart and Snapdeal in India, Alibaba in China and Amzon in the USA have become biggest wealth creators in this space.
Very easy to shop from even the confines of an office or a bedroom, no need to go to market and spend time and no need to bother about traffic or parking are some of the primary reasons for the consumers to go online for shopping. Many a time large discounts are also given on online portals. Mainly the lower overhead cost enables the online stores to sell products cheap. Online sites have become a boon during the inflationary era. All these lead to massive boom in the sector and it has attracted lots of investments resulting in greater opportunities of employment.
Though online shopping seems to be the future, many people believe that it cannot be a replacement to in-store shopping. Though youngsters like to shop online, those who are still not comfortable to use internet, like to shop from shops. Apart from this, wearable products like cloths, sunglasses or shoes require to be checked for their look and feel before buying and the online store cannot provide them. Besides this, there is a large population that derives its living from these brick and mortar shops. So it is also required to support in-store shopping.

1414,These essays are written by our students and may contain mistakes. All band score predictions are approximate.,"The renaissance that took place in Europe after the “dark ages” brought with it the call for a “free” society, where people have equal opportunities despite their race, skin colour or gender. With regards to gender equality in education, a rift was created between the liberal ideology, created after the renaissance, and the traditional ideology. While the liberals believe that females should be treated exactly like their male counterparts, hence attend the same schools, the traditionals believe that segregating boy from girls avoid unnatural behaviour and protects their chastity and modesty. In my opinion, both extremes are unhealthy for our society: unconditional mixing breaches the personal space of both genders, while absolute restriction creates a contrived society.
The argument for mixed-gender schools is based on the natural constituents of the human race, which include both men and women, and on the interdependence between males and females. The fact that both genders exist and are imperative for the sustenance of the society calls for equal treatment for both sexes. It is then argued that every body should be treated according to their humanity rather than gender. Also, men and women are both needed for a balanced society. In fact, interaction between both genders is inevitable. Therefore, restricting such interactions at schools creates a socially awkward community. Furthermore, such restriction causes more indecent behaviours between boys and girls, who are trying to fill the gap that segregation may create.
However, some people are of the opinion that segregation protects the manners of our society. First, it is natural that, in mixed schools, males and females will try to flatter each other due to the natural inclination towards each other. This creates a more unnatural and psychologically ill behaviour. This is demonstrated in movies that describe the high school culture today, such as “High School Musical”. Furthermore, they believe that segregation protects the girl’s chastity and modesty, as they are not always exposed to men. This also avoids deceptive emotional attachment before maturity. For example, research shows that most boys in school associate their relationship with girls to sexual reasons.
In my opinion, both extremes are dangerous. Therefore, there should be selective segregation, where girls and boys undergo most of their education together, but are segregated in certain situations to guard their personal space and physicality. For example, swimming classes should not be done in a mixed-gender environment to avoid explicit body exposure to opposite genders. Also, sports like running should be done separately due to the differing physical capabilities of males and females.
In short, while mixed gender schooling system is a disputed issue, I believe that it is best for segregation to be done in a case-by-case manner, while maintaining the natural human interaction between males and females.",7,band-7-essay-sample-some-people-believe-that-boys-and-girls-should-be-taught-in-separate-schools
1415,Developed nations should give financial assistance to undeveloped nations. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"No doubt, Economic growth and building infrastructure area are a precursor to a sustained prosperity for the developing world. However, I consider having a sincere political will amongst the leaders of the developing nations as the main drive of a great evolution of their countries’ economy rather than aid from the developed nations.
Aid policies were most significant in the post-world war two era. The United States had implemented a policy of marshal aid to Germany so as to deter communist influence in Europe. Apart from its political incentives, the aid had successfully contributed in West Germany’s economic miracle in the sixties. Thus, aid was the cornerstone of one of the most important economies of the world. However, aid could have never have achieved its goal if it was not for an unalterable political will that had triggered the mentioned economic mutation.
Therefore, Aid is useless without a strong leadership. In fact, Aid may cause leadership of developing countries to be lethargic and hesitant to initiate an economic growth.
For example, Jordan, as small country situated in the Middle East, is a perfect embodiment of political lethargy. A lack of will amongst its political factions has caused an awful economic stagnation as well as a chronic dependence on aid from countries such as Japan, Germany and the United states.
In conclusion , Aid from the developed nations may help the poorer countries to spark a great economic wonder, however , it is up to the recipient of the aid to use it an appropriate way in order to realize its people’s hopes and aspirations.",7,band-7-5-essay-sample-developed-nations-should-give-financial-aid-to-undeveloped-nations
1416,In some countries children take up paid jobs during the summer vacation. Some people feel that this amounts to child labour. Others argue that summer jobs help children learn valuable lessons. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Work ethic is a value that has to be instilled in a child’s moral code so that he may embrace the ways of success. However, it is imperative for us that we distinguish between a mere summer job and child labor. Thus, I ought to establish the definition of both.
As far as I think, when a child works a full time job so as to provide himself and his family, this is regarded as child labor. As for a summer job, it can be defined as a job with very limited working hours. In this case, a child retains all his rights such as education and welfare.
In many countries, children, as young as ten, are encouraged to work for at least the period of the summer vacations. Parents believe that in order to prepare their children for the real world, it would be best for them to gain exposure to the real world through a job.
As far as a mere summer job is concerned, it offers a child an invaluable lesson in taking responsibilities and respect for authority. Such an opportunity maybe considered as a mere practical lesson, but it may have the potential to reveal child’s capabilities and skills. Hence, it can help a child’s guardians to discover his hidden talents.
In conclusion, a summer job can be extremely beneficial for a child; however, guardians must be careful not to cross the line that separates a summer job and child labor.",7,band-7-5-essay-sample-summer-jobs
1417,This essay is written by a student. It may contain grammar and spelling mistakes.,"Today’s world requires faster connectivity. For sustainable economic growth it is the need of the hour that people and business can connect without any delay. The aviation industry has realized the need and reduced the rates of the flights that they operate. Obviously this has helped many people but critics also see a few pitfalls in this trend.
Globalization has brought countries closer. Businesses in one country are getting merged or acquired by businesses in other countries at increasing rates than before. Students from one country are studying in other countries. Cheaper flights are really proving to be a boon in such scenarios. It helps businesses and supports rapid economic growth. Along with this the aviation industry is also on a high growth trajectory.
However the advantages of cheaper flight come with some disadvantages too. With cheaper flights traditional transport modes will lose their sheen. A big section of the society derives their employment from industries associated with traditional mode of transports. In country such as India, Indian Railways is the second largest public sector employer. If people use railways less and less, serious questions arise on the future of these people. Secondly, it is also important to note that the world is facing increased terrorist activities and in recent years we have observed many attempts to sabotage flights. Increasing use of airways, expose us to such risks too.
Considering all the pros and cons of the situation, I am of the opinion that we should continue with the trend. Government and authorities should encourage the aviation industries to reduce the flight rates further. At the same time risks associated with security and employment should be dealt with strategic intent. Governments can declare some sops for the traditional modes of transport and help them become more competitive. People associated with them can be trained to work in other industries. The security regarding flights should be enhanced. All these measure will ensure a balanced growth.
To conclude the future lies in faster connectivity and shorter distances. The earlier we realize this the better the benefits.",7,band-7-essay-samples-flights-have-become-cheaper-is-this-a-positive-development
1418,These essays are written by our students and may contain grammar and spelling mistakes.,"Dedication is a ubiquitous trait that is instilled in most of us. However, I have always wondered why some people earn more than others. Despite the fact that everyone seems to work hard, there seems to be stark income equality in any society. Thus, we ought to explore this matter.
In a free market economy, wages are proportionate to the value of a particular employee, worker or a hired person. Such value is determined by that person’s contribution to the establishment he is working for. Thus, Celebrities gain so much money because of the enormous return they bring to the investor. For example, a typical American movie is likely to achieve three hundred percent profitability. I am never shocked when I hear about movies that can bring profits amounting to two hundred millions dollars.
However, many criticize the ways in which a free market economy functions. As far as they are concerned, they believe that even though some jobs may not generate an astounding income for an organization, these jobs are regarded as indispensable to a functioning society. For example, garbage men, as humble as this job may sound like, are essential for any city’s sanitation. Without them, inhabitants of a city would be engulfed by a horrendous plague of diseases.
In conclusion, I believe that there are jobs which are very important for the society. However, we have to accept the reality that some people can make more money than others. But I believe that scales of pay do not always reflect the importance of any job to the society.",7,ielts-band-7-essay-sample-celebrities-earn-more-money-than-other-professionals
1419,People spend a lot of money on celebrations. Is this justified?,"Ceremonies and celebrations are a part of our lives as we witness one every while. For many people, celebration is essential and for some it is a life style. However, such celebrations do have a cost. Since they are not indispensable, many people believe that paying for lavish celebrations and ceremonies is a waste of funds and that it ought to be stopped. I personally believe that everything should be done in moderation.
No doubt celebrations have an important impact on our lives. As competition amongst the workforce is intensifying, individuals are finding their lives to have become more stressful. Moreover, they work overtime, usually unpaid, just to stand out in a more than ever competitive job market. Thus, people would need a gateway for them to vent all this stress. More often, many stressed workers find this gateway during celebrations and parties. Perhaps it gives them a chance to remember the good things in life, such as love and companionship, away from the hectic work environment.
However, many people find spending money in celebrations to be a waste of time and money. In fact, they see such an act as an obstruction for one to do great things. In their opinion, such an enormous amount of money, which are spent on food and accessories for parties, could be spent on less trivial things such as education.
As far as I am concerned, I believe that celebrations are essential in our lives. However, everything should be done in moderation. After all, controlling expenses is important too.
To sum up, Celebrations is an important element in our lives as it relieves stress we face on a daily basis. Never the less, we must keep in mind that expenses should be controlled and that there are other important aspects of life such as career development.",7,band-7-essay-sample-people-spend-a-lot-of-money-on-celebrations-is-this-justified
1420,"Some people believe that capital punishment prevents people from committing gruesome crimes. However, others feel that it has failed to act as a deterrent. What is your opinion?","Capital Punishment has always been a subject of long and grueling debates amongst intellectuals and philosophers since the dawn of history.
Supporters of capital punishment argue that such a method of punishment is very effective in deterring criminals from committing murder. Also, from justice point of view, capital punishment is regarded as the just and logical punishment for murderers. As for the victim’s family, it serves as an opportunity to take revenge for their murdered loved ones.
However, critics view capital punishment as immoral. Since killing as an act on its own is a condemned one, this exclusive right of the government to kill would spark many moral dilemmas. In addition, statistics have proved that capital punishment, regardless of the method, has failed to control the number of murder cases in many countries.
In reality, there has been no established pattern that would support the claim that capital punishment serves as a tool to reduce murder cases. For example, in Scandinavian countries, where capital punishment had been abolished, the number of murder cases per capita is one of the least in the world. Hence, it is hard to say that capital punishment was the reason for this astounding result. In a country like the USA, murder cases are numerous despite capital punishment.
In conclusion, Capital punishment has failed to serve its purpose. This established through facts and statistics. In addition to being an immoral method of establishing order, it portrays governments as criminals. It is rather prosperity that can control violence in the world. After all, humans tend to do the right thing; it is circumstances that compel them to commit the evil.",7,ielts-band-7-essay-sample-is-capital-punishment-justified
